&lt;p&gt;This program will let you use two screens on two different computers as if they were connected to the same computer. It even works between different operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have two or more computers on your desk and you are tired of having several keyboards and mice around to control them, this is the program for you. While running this program, you can move the mouse pointer beyond the right or left edge of your primary display and the pointer will appear on the other computer screen. If you have ever used x2x or a computer with two graphics cards, you know what I am talking about. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>478</id><published>2003-01-15T04:35:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-01-15T04:35:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Default Passwords for Just About Everything</title><content type="html">&lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/keith"&gt;Keith Brown&lt;/a&gt; (the DevelopMentor Dark Prince of Security) turned me on to &lt;a href="http://phenoelit.darklab.org/cgi-bin/display.pl?SUBF=list&amp;amp;SORT=1"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to have default passwords listed for just about any piece of hardware or software you can think of.

But for some reason, this seems to have been getting worse lately. I'm not sure where it came from, but long about November I actually started working weekends, writing an &lt;/font&gt;&lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig/IntelArticleCode.html"&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;article&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt; for &lt;/font&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com"&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;Chris Sells&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;. Now, if you know me, you know that I'm not generally a guy to like working over six hours a day, let alone weekends. But I enjoyed it! &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;A lot of that is probably because I was working with &lt;/font&gt;&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx"&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;Managed DirectX&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;. Working with 3D graphics is so different from &lt;/font&gt;&lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig/FiveConsiderationsForLargeScaleSystems.html"&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;writing scalable systems&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt; (my usual speciality) that I had to more or less start over. It's good to be in unfamiliar territory - everything is new, and therefore cool. I mean, even the main application loop is different! I thought maybe I'd share some of my findings here.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;You've probably heard of DirectX, Microsoft's COM-based game API. It's got a bunch of pieces to it: Direct3D for doing 3D graphics, DirectDraw for doing 2D graphics, DirectPlay for hooking players together in network games, DirectSound for doing cool sound effects, etc. etc. Well, Managed DirectX brings most of those things to the CLR programmer. What they've done is provided a set of Managed C++ classes that wrap up the API so those of us that like writing managed code can make use of all the nifty hardware-accelerated goodness that DirectX gives us. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;I can't say that I'm sure what I think of MDX at this point. I've only just started, and while I have a pretty good grasp on the basics of Direct3D, the other areas are still a mystery to me. I'll be poking at DirectDraw next, to see if I can make sense of it, in pursuit of writing my presentation for &lt;a href="http://butrain.com/windev/"&gt;WinDev East 2003&lt;/a&gt;. DirectSound is probably after that. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;What's interesting about Managed DirectX - and &lt;a href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog"&gt;Ted Neward&lt;/a&gt; heard me &lt;a href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/index.jsp?date=20030105"&gt;say this&lt;/a&gt; at a recent DevelopMentor retreat - is that Managed DirectX is sort of an oxymoron. I mean, think about it: &lt;strong&gt;DirectX&lt;/strong&gt;, because it's letting you get at the graphics and sound hardware directly, for performance. But managed execution is all about isolating you from the details of what lies beneath. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;So it's not entirely clear to me whether Managed DirectX will see widespread adoption or not. Will the added overhead of the CLR mean that people won't be able to write games in C#? Probably. But there are lots of other potential applications that don't necessarily require massive amounts of real-time performance, but which could benefit from the productivity enhancements. Things like architectural walkthoughs come to mind, since you might be able to prerender everything. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;All I know is, it's fun territory to explore, since you can create some cool 3D stuff without all the mind-numbing bookkeeping required in COM and C++. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;Next time: Direct3D: the basic game loop. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>480</id><published>2003-01-19T07:16:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-01-19T07:16:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Visual Studio .NET Help Integration Kit</title><content type="html">&lt;a href="http://www.develop.com/dm/bio.asp?id=93"&gt;Kirk Fertitta&lt;/a&gt; just turned me on to the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?url=/downloads/sample.asp?url=/msdn-files/027/001/914/msdncompositedoc.xml"&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;Microsoft Visual Studio .NET Help Integration Kit&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

I really did. I made every effort to reuse something existing rather than write my own. But yesterday I caved in when I was told that I was going to have to run my load tests after hours, because the evaluation copy of &lt;a href="http://www.red-gate.com/dotnet/load_testing.htm"&gt;ANTS Load&lt;/a&gt; I was working with doesn't have scheduling capability. It was either start working nights, find something that &lt;strong&gt;does&lt;/strong&gt; have scheduling capability that I can get an eval copy of, or write my own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with .NET is that it only took me a day to write the basics of a reasonably feature-rich load-testing harness. And I knew it wouldn't take that long, which is what made it so tempting. But of course that same day would probably have gotten me up to speed on some existing tool that a) doesn't have the bugs that mine certainly does, b) I don't have to support, and c) probably has lots more features. It was just tooooooo tempting to write code, rather than download and review some boring tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An unfortunate aspect of the standards viewing systems is that because they afford such generality  they are hopelessly cumbersome and difficult to interface with. Even if a subset of parameters is used, the default values for the unused parameters have to be appreciated and understood. Perhpas this is inevitable. The function of a standard, in one sense, is not to reflect common usage but to define a complete set of facilities that a user may require in a general viewing sytem. That some of these facilities will hardly ever be used is unfortunate. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don't claim to know much more than the very basics about aspect-oriented programming, but I have to say I've been skeptical of it all along. Tim Ewald taught me (through our discussions about MTS/COM+) that services do not in general compose orthogonally. That is, it's mostly impossible to sort of "slap on" a service to an existing piece of code without side effects. For example, turning on transactions in MTS/COM+ meant redesigning your code, not to mention requring you to turn on about six other services.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What AOP seems to offer is that exact same chimera: Hey! Just create an aspect and apply it to any piece of code! No worries, mate! What John seems to be coming to is that while that &lt;strong&gt;seems&lt;/strong&gt; really cool, it only works well for a fairly limited set of things. He mentions security specifically, which I find interesting, since this was one of the only really useful services that MTS/COM+ offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I still have yet to be convinced that plain ol' structures and functions aren't the answer to about 90% of the programming problems out there. People keep searching for the one true technology, but objects aren't it, CORBA's not it, aspects aren't it, relational mapping tools aren't it...maybe we had it mostly right from the start: here is a function foo that takes a structure blah and produces a structure quux. After all, it's hard to find a programmer that doesn't get BASIC, but even those with years of experience still stumble on objects. KISS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But blah blah blah - what do I know? &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>514</id><published>2003-02-11T19:17:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-02-11T19:17:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Unbreakable Encryption?</title><content type="html">&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think what they probably mean is "unbreakable within the lifespan of the solar system given exponential growth in computer power and no new cryptanalytic techniques being developed". But I think we've already got that with existing algorithms for large enough key lengths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, though, it's probably a non-issue either way. Even mediocre crytpography is probably the strongest link in most systems.

&lt;div class="itemDesc"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;It's been a very scary day. Heather got very sick and we had to take her to the hospital where she has been admitted. At only three weeks old it got very scary fast. We weren't sure what she had. The doctors have figured out RSV, a virus. Thankfully they didn't have to do the spinal tap. Since they don't let both parents stay I have been sent home to "rest" which is hard. Sue is there with her. It looks like she will be ok. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" class="itemDesc"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wow - that's pretty rough.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;Graphics acceleration is turned almost all the way off in the Windows 2003 server products to increase the stability of the platform. Of course, since I want to be able to do DirectX work, this was not acceptable. Not to mention my screen redraws were visibly slower than what I'm used to. Cranking the slider all the way over to the right means I can play &lt;/font&gt;&lt;a href="http://wormsblast.team17.com"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;Worms Blast&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt; again.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/archives/000227.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here's some good information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; on why.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These guys usually have very good information, but the thing that really amused me was this line: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;But you didn?t have &lt;b&gt;ServiceDomain&lt;/b&gt; so that you could easily get to COM+ Services Without Components from managed code.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I always knew only about three people read my MSDN article about &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/02/04/COMXP/default.aspx"&gt;how to do exactly this&lt;/a&gt; well over a year ago. :) Of course, they're obviously playing around with it under the 1.1 SDK and Windows server 2003 - things may have changed since I was messing with the technology.

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;em&gt;I'm very pleased to announce the release of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newsgator.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NewsGator 1.0&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the same time comes the public debut of NewsGator's new home, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newsgator.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://www.newsgator.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. There you'll find lots of information about NewsGator, news, downloads, a RSS feed search system, support resources (including a knowledge base and discussion forums), and of course the NewsGator store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This has been an interesting development cycle...all the way from the first concept screen shot right here on my weblog, to where we are today with version 1.0. I'd like to publicly thank all of those who have been working with the 0.x versions, and especially those folks who volunteered to thoroughly test the RC1 release. Thanks to all of your efforts, I think NewsGator 1.0 is a great product!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are numerous changes since the last release. I encourage you to download version 1.0 and try it...and if you like it, spread the word!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newsgator.com/news/news.aspx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Press release&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Greg Reinacker has released NewsGator 1.0. Congratulations Greg! I've already downloaded and installed it, and I have to say it looks very nice. I was going to stick with (freeware) Syndirella since Greg is going to be charging now, but it's just tooooo nice for me to have news in my Outlook inbox. I'm going to give the release version a try for a few days, but I highly suspect I'll be coughing up the $29 he's asking very shortly. Heck, if I paid $40 for Radio....&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>537</id><published>2003-02-25T04:35:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-02-25T04:35:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Find Your Name in the Digits of PI</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;Just for fun.

They also have a client that uses A. Later, they version Foo to v2, and build component B against it. Then they add code to the client to work with B. Both A and B have methods that accept a Foo as a parameter, but A has been compiled against Foo v1, and B has been compiled against Foo v2. The client has been updated to work with the latest Foo v2. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here's the picture that shows what everyone is built against&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" width="183" src="http://pluralsight.com/craig/images/versions.jpg" height="188" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, the terrible part comes when the client creates a Foo and passes it to A. A thinks it's getting a Foo v1, but it's really getting a Foo v2. And the truly awful bit is, it acts as if it were a Foo v1, right down to going after the wrong bits of memory and calling the wrong methods. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/etc/zips/cs-versionproblem-sample1.zip"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to download some code that demonstrates this. Simply extract the files into some directory, run &lt;b&gt;nmake&lt;/b&gt; to build everything, and then run &lt;b&gt;client&lt;/b&gt;. Observe the output, and tell me if you think that's what you'd expect based on looking at client.cs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/etc/zips/cs-versionproblem-sample2.zip"&gt;another variation&lt;/a&gt; that actually &lt;i&gt;crashes&lt;/i&gt; the process. That's usually (incorrectly) thought to be impossible without writing unsafe or unmanaged code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sort-of good news is that the code won't verify. This doesn't help when you run it with full trust (since fully trusted code gets to skip verification) but at least someone can't exploit this issue for mobile code. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reason this happens is that C# (and VB.NET, and others) give you no way to specify which version of something you'd like to build against at a language level. This totally sucks - there are times when you really, really care what winds up in the metadata, even with config files. We can, of course, fix this particular problem by using interfaces that we don't version, but I would argue that being forced into a design decision to avoid a language limitation is sub-optimal. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>540</id><published>2003-02-26T18:31:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-02-26T18:31:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">How Evil Am I? </title><content type="html">&lt;div align="left"&gt;Neutral?

When I was in college, MUSHes and MUDs were all the rage. I lived in a very energetic dorm that had a raging social life that saw us routinely sit around until 7 in the morning, interacting in large groups and generally being social. When we discovered MUDs, though, several of us took to hanging out obsessively in the computer labs at the Teer or North buildings, losing ourselves for entire weeks in the online universes when we had BETTER, PHYSICAL options closer to home. And after we came to our senses, we discovered that this wasn't an exception, but a rule; tech heads were giving up physical socializing for virtual community. It wasn't due to lack of alternatives, it was despite alternatives. I can't explain it, but I know in my gut that tech heads don't go online because they have nowhere else to turn.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I'm not sure I can completely agree. His assertion that the physical places are BETTER is what I take exception with. Comparisons like this one assume that there are some sort units of "goodness" and that that physical places rate a 7 while the online ones rate a 3. I would argue that even if there are some notional units, it's a vector quantity, not a scalar, and the axes for the two types of interaction are orthogonal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The way I see it, the online experience (or role-playing games such as &lt;a href="http://www.white-wolf.com/vampire.html"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;, which I still enjoy) have aspects of &lt;em&gt;creation&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt; which real life lacks. The times when I get most involved in the computer is when I'm crafting something or solving a puzzle, and the reason I like both computers and fantasy/sci-fi fiction is that it proposes a world where magic is real and humans can transcend their inherent limitations. Real-life seldom offers these sorts of psychological payoffs, although that might explain why &lt;a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~mafia/rules.htm"&gt;Mafia&lt;/a&gt; is so damn fun - it combines elements of both. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>543</id><published>2003-03-02T13:40:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-03-02T13:40:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">See my response back on the Surprisingly High Tower. ;)</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="542"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>544</id><published>2003-03-02T13:33:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-03-02T13:33:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Open Source Benefits Whom?</title><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;By way of &lt;a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/spoutletex.aspx#nn2003-03-02T09:31:13Z"&gt;Don's blog&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/JAvery/posts/3273.aspx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;James Avery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;] The open source movement is really only going to provide software for geeks like me to play around with before we go to work to build Microsoft applications."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I have to say this argument resonates with me. So often I think we can observe the effect that everyone assumes everyone else is just like them. So open source developers - highly skilled, computer-adept people - are likely to develop software aimed straight at...highly skilled, computer-adept people. Of course, ask these same people to descibe a typical user (i.e. the marketplace) and "highly skilled" and "computer-adept" are not the top phrases you'll hear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Does this mean we shouldn't encourage open source? Hell, no! Just because something is ultimately futile in the big picture does not mean we shouldn't do it. Indeed, I struggle with this dilemma in my professional life all the time. For as many people as I teach or mentor, I know that at the end of the day, less than half of them have both the time and the talent to really make use of what I've told them. At times, I've thought this was grounds for just going into a corner and doing everything myself (note &lt;a href="http://rover.cs.northwestern.edu/~surana/blog/archives/000079.html"&gt;the assumption on my part that I'm any good&lt;/a&gt;). But eventually I realized that "it's better to light a candle than to curse the darkness." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Therefore one of these days soon, I'm going to go contribute to some worthwhile piece of open source software. If you have suggestions, for what to help out on, please let me know. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>545</id><published>2003-03-02T13:39:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-03-02T13:39:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">You should definitely check out &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/crystal/"&gt;Crystal Space&lt;/a&gt;.

The second one is the killer - I do make use of Offline Files, in particular when I travel. "Oh well," I thought, "I'll just use Fast User Switching, like &lt;a href="http://www.deploymentcentric.com/"&gt;Joeseph Shook&lt;/a&gt; suggested." Two problems with that: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1) I can't figure out how to turn it on (yet) in WS2003. &lt;br /&gt;2) Assuming 1 is just because I'm dumb, when I do turn it on, it will preclude me joining a domain. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Right now I'm running my laptop outside a domain. But I'd really like to join up on a domain when I get my other computer flipped over to WS2003. It really sucks that I have to choose two of offline files, joining a domain, and using Terminal Services, since I want all three. But this just hammers home &lt;a href="http://www.develop.com/kbrown/book/html/lifestyle.html"&gt;the point that Keith made&lt;/a&gt; about how developers can't assume that regular users run as non-administrators.

It sounds awesome, not least because I'm building something at work that I could have built with this in about a tenth the time. Well, the Office 11 beta goes public in about a month, so it shouldn't be long before I can get my hands on it. Some features, via &lt;a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0108971/2003/03/06.html#a121"&gt;Clemens's blog:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you design a form based on an XML Schema, and fill out that form later, the document that you'll save will be a pure XML document instance of the exact underlying schema, without any other goo. InfoPath will only associate the instance with itself by injecting a processing instruction. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;InfoPath understands XML Schema type restrictions, validates them and gives you red frames on fields that are wrong. It spell-checks and gives you red squiggles for misspelled words. It gives you repeating edit regions for arrays of complex types. It gives you date pickers for dates. It gives you combo-boxes for enums. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you "export" a form template (whose native storage format is, inexplicably, binary), you will find an XSLT innocently hanging out in your output directory. That stylesheet is capable of rendering an XML instance of the underlying schema to a proper DHTML page that is visually (and functionally) equivalent to the form you've designed. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can submit a filled out form to a file or to a web service; however, most importantly, you can submit to a Windows Scripting Host script (JScript/VBScript). Which means that you could smuggle (for instance) a COM/Interopped managed pipeline underneath it (think WSE) that will wrap the payload into an envelope and add all the current and essential web services stuff to it. Or you could submit to a disconnected message queue on a client and have a server do the processing for forwarding your data into a service-oriented bus. Or you could drop stuff into BizTalk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>560</id><published>2003-03-06T02:29:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-03-06T02:29:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">It seems that public beta of Office System 2003 Edition should be out on March 20.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="559"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>561</id><published>2003-03-07T04:46:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-03-07T04:46:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Dave Barry Hits Close to Home</title><content type="html">I'm getting married in a little over two weeks.

Therefore it is inevitable that the Linux curve and the lower limit of user expectations curve intersect. This is what Christensen calls a "disruptive technology".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the case of server applications, Linux has clearly exceeded the lower limit of user expectations, which explains why Linux is commoditizing the market for low-end server applications. In the case of desktop applications, the OpenOffice / Linux combination hasn't quite reached the lower limit of user expectations, which explains the relatively shallow penetration of Linux into those markets. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;However, if you accept that the rate of OpenOffice / Linux innovation will outstrip the rate of increase in the lower limit of user expectations, it becomes inevitable that Linux will begin to hit Microsoft close to home: in the desktop and the office productivity markets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;I have to say that this argument appeals to me somewhat. The idea that there's a threshhold that software needs to cross before it can "break out" seems intuitive. Not having read "The Innovator's Dilemma", I don't know whether the theory includes price and quality as factors, not to mention simple inertia - OpenOffice will have to actually be quite a bit better than the lower limit of expectations to make people switch. Also, there's a fairly explicit assumption in the "if you accept that the rate of OpenOffice / Linux innovation will outstrip the rate of increase in the lower limit of user expectations" statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;But like I said &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2003/03/02.aspx\"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, I still think there's something to Open Source - it sounds like "The Innovator's Dilemma" takes a stab at quantifying.

&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;div style="mso-line-spacing: '90 50 0'; mso-char-wrap: 1; mso-kinsoku-overflow: 1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IIS 6.0 has been totally re-designed with a new request processing architecture that has the benefits of high isolation without incurring the out-of-process cost, as well as much higher levels of reliability and scalability. IIS 6.0 has been redesigned into two main pieces: HTTP.SYS - a kernel-mode HTTP listener and WAS - a user-mode configuration and process manager. Along with this are worker processes that service requests for application pools in HTTP.SYS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style="mso-line-spacing: '90 50 0'; mso-char-wrap: 1; mso-kinsoku-overflow: 1" dir="ltr"&gt;One question that I'm hoping Sam will address sometime soon is, "How can I take advantage of this to have my app listen on an arbitrary endpoint on port 80?" Obviously, HTTP is an important protocol, and since having inetinfo.exe hog port 80 is a thing of the past, I'd like to know what I can do. Do I need to write ISAPI code? Is there a new API? Tell!

What's particularly interesting about them is that much of the material has nothing to do with J2EE. (Then again, much of the best writing applies across technologies. Like &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201615940/qid=1047909108/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-3270984-0097702?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;n=507846"&gt;Tim's book&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201745720/qid=1047909142/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-3270984-0097702?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books"&gt;Szyperski's book&lt;/a&gt;.) For example, &lt;a href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/index.jsp?date=20030317#1047892871572"&gt;this posting&lt;/a&gt; talks about the rise of component-orientation, which has replaced object-orientation as the New Hope of Reuse. One thing that Ted hasn't addressed yet (but that I hope he will) is how to succeed with a component-oriented philosophy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always noticed that the first time I do anything, I do it wrong. I'm not even talking about software, although it's certainly true there as well. I mean the first time I do &lt;strong&gt;anything&lt;/strong&gt; - buy a car, choose a printer, play golf. I've taken many approaches over the years, from just going ahead and doing it to attempting to do all the research right up front so I can make the perfect choice. The sweet spot - as it almost invariably does - lies somewhere in the middle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For component reuse to be successful requires a certain amount of forethought. You have to try to figure out how the component is going to be used. You should also expect to be wrong, because you will. Get over it. In fact, plan for it. Then iterate your design - the knowledge you gain integrating it into other systems is a necessary piece of information without which it is &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt; to get things right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting implications for this is that versioning capabilities are important to understand. If you know there's going to be a v2, then you had better understand how to deploy it over v1. There are lots of strategies for doing this, and the CLR introduces a whole new set of capabilities, but as an industry we still don't understand how to solve this problem. I'd love to hear if anyone thinks the seminal work on this topic has been written - I'm not aware of it. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>588</id><published>2003-03-17T15:10:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-03-17T15:10:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">NewsGator Plus Outlook 2003: Works Great...Now</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href="http://www.newsgator.com"&gt;NewsGator&lt;/a&gt; to read blogs. I love it. So when I upgraded to Outlook 2003 (jury is still out, but I think I like it) I was crushed when NewsGator stopped working. Actually, it works fine under Outlook 2003, but not if you &lt;a href="http://www.develop.com/kbrown/book/html/lifestyle.html"&gt;don't run as adminstrator&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2003/02/06.aspx"&gt;I don't&lt;/a&gt;. So I had to choose: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Give up running as admin.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Give up Outlook 2003.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Give up NewsGator. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Honestly, 1 would be a relief, but it would also be giving in to the forces of darkness. Two would sort of suck - I want to check it out, and I'm not even sure I could migrate back, since I was dumb enough not to back up my pst file. As I said, option three was painful. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Luckily, I emailed the amazing &lt;a href="http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/"&gt;Greg Reinacker&lt;/a&gt;, author of NewsGator, and within a few hours, he'd sent me this .reg file: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier, Monospace"&gt;Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier, Monospace"&gt;[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\Outlook\\Addins\\NewsGator.Connect]&lt;br /&gt;"FriendlyName"="NewsGator"&lt;br /&gt;"Description"="RSS News Aggregator for Microsoft Outlook"&lt;br /&gt;"LoadBehavior"=dword:00000003&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And everything started working again.

&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;When I try to shut down, reboot, suspend, or hibernate my laptop, it sits and thrashes, often for minutes, before giving me the "Turn Off Computer" window. (I'm running Windows XP Pro, and I'm referring to the window that pops up when you do Start Menu -&amp;gt; Turn Off Computer.)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;...&lt;font face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It turns out that the thing that was causing the thrashing pre shutdown was that Windows was scanning my whole recycling bin before showing me the window. I'm not quite sure why - I guess there are certain events that cause it to go and check that the recycle bin isn't occupying more space than it should, and shutdown is one of those.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A texture is simply an image ? say from a BMP file ? that is ?glued? or ?tacked? onto a triangle or series of triangles. If you do it right, you can have very detailed-looking objects that consist of only a few triangles, and therefore render very quickly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>49981</id><published>2008-01-18T16:39:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-01-18T16:39:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Managed Direct3D - Texture Basics</title><content type="html">So where is the exmplanation?</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="598"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>49990</id><published>2008-01-19T05:50:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-01-19T05:50:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Managed Direct3D - Texture Basics</title><content type="html">I don't understand the question.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="598"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>601</id><published>2003-03-30T23:17:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-03-30T23:17:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Great List of Tools</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Via &lt;a href="http://www.ingorammer.com/Weblog/default.aspx?day=2003-03-31#20030331093300"&gt;Ingo&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

First &lt;a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/mgudgin/default.aspx#nn2003-03-31T06:22:13Z"&gt;Gudge&lt;/a&gt; then Don did so, but &lt;a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1298.html"&gt;Sam&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that content:encoded was a poor substitute for xhtml:body. Now &lt;a href="http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/archive.aspx?post=564"&gt;Greg&lt;/a&gt; has released NewsGator 1.1, with support for xhtml:body so I can read it all in my favorite newsreader.

It turned out that - for whatever reason - the changes in &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2003/03/18.aspx"&gt;the reg file he sent me last time&lt;/a&gt; didn't kick in when I ran it this time.

I don't know why, but the mixer device just won't install properly. Since I have the odd mix of requirements that this be my music-producing machine and my web server, I'd really like to run some sort of server OS &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;have full functionality from my sound card. At least now the basic ports are working - I just can't get all the fancy front-panel stuff like Line In 2 working. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe I'll be able to call Creative now that W2K3 is a (nearly) released OS. Can't say I have much hope for them supporting a server platform, though. In the meantime, if anyone has had any luck on this front, let me know. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At least I'm not alone: &lt;a href="http://www.ingorammer.com/Weblog/default.aspx?day=2003-04-01#20030401114100"&gt;Ingo is having problems too&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>604</id><published>2003-04-01T19:06:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-04-01T19:06:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">Remember Windows 2000 ?

It's a security prototype that uses RSA signatures to issue security tickets, similar to what Kerberos does. Since it accesses a database to record session information and verify passwords, I fully expected that the profiler would show everything in the noise relative to network roundtrips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine my surprise when the slowest line of code was this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier, Monospace"&gt;RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider(csp);&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What?! But sure enough, it's "slower than molasses in January", as my dad always says (excuse him, he's from South Dakota). Well, 20 minutes of coding later, I'd added a simple synchronized Queue where I pool the instances when I'm done with them, and the code got a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; faster - like 25% per request. I scheduled some performance tests last night to see exactly how much difference it makes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's great is, my client has been after me to make a different optimization - one he thought of. And it's a good optimization, but it's not likely to have a tenth the impact. There's just no way we would have guessed that this particular line of code would be so expensive. In fact, I'm not sure it's worth it at this point to do his optimization at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral of the story is, "beware premature optimization." Profile, fix the slowest thing you can, and for the most part don't bother optimizing at design time. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>608</id><published>2003-04-02T22:49:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-04-02T22:49:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Taiwan, Thailand - What's the Difference? </title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;My wife is going to be in Taiwan for a few weeks to visit her family. We already have an international calling plan, but I asked around to see if anyone knew of anything cheaper, since we'll be calling a lot. Franci Penov (among others) thoughtfully replied. Here's an exerpt: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;Since they specialize in low prices for Bulgaria, their rates for Thailand [2] are somewhat higher - $0.11 per minute if you call Bangkok, between $0.16 and $0.27 for the other cities and $0.365 for cell phones. If you live in New York and use their local number, the prices are with about $0.02 less. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;There might be other cheaper phone cards that specialize in low pricez to Thailand that offer even better prices. :-) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;You'll notice that he thought I said "Thailand" rather than "Taiwan". Hey, they're both Asia, right? An honest mistake. But being the smartass I am, I responded: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm not sure my wife would appreciate me calling Thailand while she's in Taiwan. ;)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;"Ha ha," I thought, "I'm so funny!"&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;Then I got Franci's response, which made me realize that I'm clearly only bush-league funny. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;Craig, &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;I agree that the problem you state below can be a big issue for some of our customers. However, that doesn't mean our feature implementation is not right. Let's me expand on this little bit more. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;The original problem we wanted to solve was how to call in Taiwan without paying much. The implementation cost for "call cheap any location in Asia" feature is essentially the same as the cost of implementing the "call cheap Taiwan" scenario, so the management decided that we should implement this feature instead, as it will address broader set of customer scenarios. We had to provide a default value for the particular location to call in the case the customer does not provide one; we choose the default value of 'Thailand', but of course this value can change after the proper usability study is conducted by the UE team. Our current implementation of this feature is the correct although probably not the most optimized one, as specified by the feature design. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;If we need to add the feature "talk with the customer's wife", the PM team should write the appropriate feature design document. One possible issue with such feature will be how to find the location of the customer's wife, so we might need to design this feature as well. I can write small architecture document describing tri-tier distributed solution for this problem after that which will use as underlying way of communication the "call cheap any location in Asia" feature (provided that the customer's wife was located to be in Asia) or the corresponding "call cheap any location in Europe" or "call cheap any location in Africa" features (although these two are not implemented currently). &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;I will reflect the necessary time for the architectual design of this feature in my schedule. The cost of the actual implementation will be reflected there as well, although at this point i can provide only SWAG and the actual costing will happen after the architecture design review. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;As for the particular bug you are refering below (customer's wife not being happy) - there is an easy workaround the customers can deploy - don't tell the customer's wife that the customer called somebody in Thailand. Of course we all know that security through obscurity approach is not in general favored; however it will have low impact on the customer's TCO and as such it should be recommended unless the customer's wife is known to implement active data mining on the customer's call logs. In future we will need to add new feature - role-based security for the access to the phone line logs and the customer's bank statements. Given it's cost though, we will not be able to add it to our current product version and will have to make it v.next feature. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;I hope this explanation presents clearly the current state of the product and our future plans and addresses your and customer's concerns. If you have further questions/comments on this particular feature or any other feature in our product, please do not hessitate to contact me. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Franci&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Awesome. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>53634</id><published>2008-09-24T00:56:34.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-09-24T00:56:34.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Taiwan, Thailand - What's the Difference? </title><content type="html">Thank you...

The problem is that once created, arrays can't change size. But what if you don't necessarily know how big it'll be right off the bat. Here's my favorite way to deal with arrays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"&gt;ArrayList al = new ArrayList();&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"&gt;for (loop over some set of things)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"&gt;{&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;al.Add(thing);&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"&gt;}&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"&gt;Thing[] things = &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"&gt;  (Thing[]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"&gt;al.ToArray(typeof(Thing));&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, System.ArrayList is a convenient way to keep track of a list of things that you can later turn into an array. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better is the fact that you can construct an ArrayList from any array, like so: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier, Monospace"&gt;ArrayList list = new ArrayList(things); &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you can remove a particular item like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier, Monospace"&gt;list.Remove(particularThing); &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;Combine these three things, and you have a convenient way to remove an item from a list: turn the array into an ArrayList, remove the item you care about, then turn it back into an array. Or use Add instead of Remove, and you've got a convenient way to append things. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>76303</id><published>2010-05-01T05:03:46.0-05:00</published><updated>2010-05-01T05:03:46.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Building an Array</title><content type="html">I am one year old in Java and this was just what I was looking for, simple and great article.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="609"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>610</id><published>2003-04-05T01:17:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-04-05T01:17:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Oregon and Open Source</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com"&gt;Chris Sells&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/spout/#oros"&gt;a very interesting experience&lt;/a&gt; helping shape Oregon state laws that would set up barriers to non-open-source solutions. &lt;/p&gt;

Really short. But Alice wanted me to grow it out a little bit for wedding pictures, so I did. For six weeks I didn't touch a clippers to my head. It bugged me to have long(er) hair, but if that's what Alice wanted then I was all too happy to comply. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Naturally, when we got back from Hawaii, the first thing I did was cut my hair. Or rather, I had Alice cut it. Along the way, she decided to give me a new hairstyle.

Although I'm a big time &lt;a href="www.newsgator.com"&gt;NewsGator&lt;/a&gt; fan, I thought I'd try it. You never know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Sharpreader doesn't seem to want to run as non-administrator right now. It looks like it wants to write to the Program Files directory. God, that's annoying, not to mention it usually makes the program completely single-user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I'll play around with it and see if I can get it to work in a non-administrative context. Then I can let you know what I think.

I don't like that there's no way to mark a group of messages as read or unread. I don't like that it doesn't notify you when new messages arrive. These things have been said &lt;a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1321.html"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sort of like the way it groups related messages, but so far I haven't found this to be a killer feature, the way running inside of Outlook is (&lt;a href="http://www.newsgator.com"&gt;ala NewsGator&lt;/a&gt;). If NewsGator never develops this feature, I won't miss it a ton, as the temporal locality of related messages is currently high enough that I can remember what went on in a thread. Telling me about related posts in feeds I &lt;strong&gt;don't&lt;/strong&gt; subscribe to would be way cooler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing about SharpReader that I really like is that it is &lt;em&gt;insanely &lt;/em&gt;fast. Really really fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you should try it out to see if you like it - it truly is a nice piece of software from what I've seen. Looking over my post from this morning, I see that it might seem that I was dismissive of it. That was not my intention:  I want to say a hearty, "Well done!" to the author, &lt;a href="http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/"&gt;Luke Hutteman&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the issue with not running as non-Administrator is almost definitely that it wants to read from the program directory. Someone suggested that I just run it from some other directory (e.g. My Documents), but not only is that a horrible hack, but it still doesn't solve the problem of it not being multiuser. Still, it's an early version, and (I suspect) an easy fix. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>617</id><published>2003-04-08T00:23:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-04-08T00:23:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">To BCL or Not to BCL</title><content type="html">&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"&gt;&lt;span class="050011709-09012003"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman,Times,Serif"&gt;&lt;span class="050011709-09012003"&gt;Debate rages on: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sorry.... string, int, char and long are part of the language. Int32 is just some detail of the underlying platform. The fact that C# and VB.NET very convienently map onto the CLR type system doesn't mean that all languages do. Using BCL types also takes away the flexibility only a high level language and its abstraction over the platform can provide. Mind WPARAM and LPARAM in Win16 (16bits,32bits) vs. Win32 (32bits) vs. Win64 (64bits). (For the younger amongst us, the "W" in WPARAM used to mean "WORD" as in "16bit processor word" and "L" used to mean "LONG" as in, ahem, "long" or "double word"). Been there, hated that. If a language can fix those problems for me by providing a layer of abstraction ... thank you, will buy.

&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;Sorry again...I don't think I quite agree. Reading &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/techinfo/articles/upgrade/Csharpdownload.asp"&gt;the C# specification&lt;/a&gt;, int is defined as a 32 bit integer, period. In fact, the specification even says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"&gt;Each of the predefined types is shorthand for a system-provided type. For example, the keyword &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Codefragment"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"&gt;&lt;font face="Lucida Console"&gt;int&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"&gt; refers to the struct &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Codefragment"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"&gt;&lt;font face="Lucida Console"&gt;System.Int32&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"&gt;So I don't think I understand the comment about this in any way taking away flexibility. The platform abstraction is provided by the CLR, not the language. Given that the biggest problem with WPARAM and LPARAM (and int) was the fact that they changed size, I would think tying the language keyword to a particular type is a good thing. If you really need a type that means "the sort of natural size of the underlying platform" that's what System.IntPtr is for. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"&gt;Also, we can certainly use the type names (as opposed to the keywords) in C# and VB.NET only. If there are other languages that provide a "layer of abstraction," then great. In the meantime, given how many times I've had to explain to people that int and System.Int32 are the same thing, that a long is actually always 64 bits, and that Integer in VB.NET is 32 bits not 16, I think using the CLR type names is a great idea, particularly in sample code. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"&gt;Of course, the spec also says: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a matter of style, use of the keyword is favored over use of the complete system type name.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"&gt;and as with any question of style there is no "right" answer. :) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>618</id><published>2003-04-08T23:45:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-04-08T23:45:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Cool Word Shortcut</title><content type="html">&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One side benefit is that Tommy Williams told me that Word maps the 'F4' key to the last operation you completed. If you are deleting rows from a table (Alt-A, D, R), F4 saves you a lot of keystrokes. Maybe everyone else in the world new about this (if so, why didn't you tell me?), but it was a new to me, and very useful. &lt;font size="2"&gt;[&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/tewald/default.aspx#nn2003-04-09T08:42:23Z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Pushing the Envelope&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you want to know why, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml" title="http://www.hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ian Hickson is the guy who convinced me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. I do believe that the issues he brings up and real and important.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I'm going to partially disagree. Having read Ian's argument, I think he ignores a very real and important phenomenon: the standards aren't set in stone. Things on the Internet frequently evolve when a bunch of people decide to do something, it breaks a bunch of other things, and the authors of those things then fix them to work with the new stuff. Observe &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2003/03/31.aspx"&gt;the recent rapid evolution of blog reading software&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In other words, the fact that XHTML doesn't work with existing software doesn't mean we should avoid it in all cases. For example, &lt;a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx#nn2003-03-29T06:15:00Z"&gt;using it in RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds might be fine, since the software for RSS readers is still evolving rapidly and can quickly adapt to the changes. And it's easy to see that XHTML is easier to parse than HTML 4.01, which can have all sorts of nice benefits. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Notice that I'm not arguing for a complete switchover to XHTML right now today. I agree with Ian's points that it is currently problematic, and I probably &lt;em&gt;wouldn't &lt;/em&gt;go that route if I were authoring the main page of my company's website. But not everything I do is that mission-critical, so I won't eschew its use, either. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>624</id><published>2003-04-13T02:25:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-04-13T02:25:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">Here's the thing though.

Because of a slightly strange mix of requirements, I wound up spending about a week working on an authentication and key exchange protocol that was halfway between Kerberos and SSL. We've since ditched that effort, which made me happy: inventing our own security made me really nervous. As I was perusing the absolutely excellent &lt;em&gt;Secrets &amp;amp; Lies&lt;/em&gt; (by Bruce Schneier) yesterday, I found a quote that was all too appropriate. In it, Schneier is addressing the prevalent but INCREDIBLY STUPID myth that products that don't tell you the details of their security implementation are somehow more secure. (Microsoft has historically been a bad offender in this category, but there are plenty of other examples.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The problem can be best illustrated with a story. Suppose your doctor said, "I realize we have antibiotics that are good at treating your kind of infection without harmful side effects, and that decades of research support this treatment. But I'm going to give you a pulverized pretzel instead, because, um, it might work." You'd get a new doctor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, use what's there.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>645</id><published>2003-04-19T03:07:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-04-19T03:07:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Book Idea</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had what I thought was an interesting idea for a book the other day. Since I doubt I'll ever write the darn thing, I'll post it here in case it inspires someone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, I thought it would be cool to write a list of 10 or 20 or whatever common myths/mistakes. More or less the converse of stuff like &lt;em&gt;Effective COM&lt;/em&gt;. Could call it &lt;em&gt;Ineffective Programming&lt;/em&gt; or something. It would be things like: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a one-to-one mapping between database entities and objects is a good idea. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should design your application with performance foremost in mind. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SOAP toolkits should hide XML. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of making statements that seem reasonable to many people but in fact are a Bad Idea or Just Plain Wrong. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>646</id><published>2003-04-19T06:23:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-04-19T06:23:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">Re: Book Idea</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="645"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>647</id><published>2003-04-19T06:30:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-04-19T06:30:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">I *love* that ideas!

But I lied. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Actually, I made a mistake. What happened was, I started writing about meshes and realized that using meshes and textures together at the same time is a bit much for an introduction. So I decided that we should talk about materials, which will give us a nice gentle way to get started with meshes. After we talk about zbuffers, too, of course. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We?ve now talked about two ways to get objects in our scenes to have some color: we can either &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig.DirectX/RenderVertexBufferTutorial.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;use a vertex format&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; that has color information, or we can &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig.DirectX/TextureBasicsTutorial.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;use a texture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to warp a bitmap onto a triangle or set of triangles. But it turns out there is at least one more way: we can set up a material. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A material is a bunch of global settings that tells the &lt;span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"&gt;Device&lt;/span&gt;, ?Hey, the next time you draw a triangle, I?d like it to look like this.? The settings are captured in a structure of type &lt;span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"&gt;Material&lt;/span&gt;, and are associated with the &lt;span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"&gt;Device&lt;/span&gt; by assigning to its property of the same name.

After thinking about it a bit, I decided I'd rather say this: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have been lucky enough to meet many of the "big names" in our particular corner of the industry. I will admit to being slightly taken aback when my DevelopMentor interview/audition was with Don Box, Chris Sells, Keith Brown, Ted Pattison, and Brent Rector. "I've read these guys' books! I've seen them speak at conferences!" &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having been lucky enough to associate with these sorts of people for the last few years, I've come to realize that they're just people. Duh, of course, but it's one thing to know something, and another to Know it. Anyway, I can tell you right now that they make mistakes. They have lapses in judgement. They take erroneous stances on certain points. At the end of the day, it comes down to this: what is the quality of their work? Not "How famous are they?" &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm not going to speak to Mr. Winer's overall quality of work - opinions on that are well documented elsewhere. But I will say this: I've disliked Radio almost from the moment I installed it.

I chose MT because of its maturity and because it's hackable and written in a language that I already know (Perl).  People say that Radio is source-available, but as far as I can tell (perhaps Dave can correct me), you need to buy Frontier (USD $899) if you want to hack it.  On the down side, I find MT's server-based authoring a bit clunky -- Radio is much more responsive.  In theory this can be remedied by using a desktop-based tool and hooking into MT's XML-RPC interface, but I haven't gotten around to making that work.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="654"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>14760</id><published>2005-09-11T07:40:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-09-11T07:40:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Dave Winer Is An Idiot</title><content type="html">Dave Winer has cynically dumped his vaunted principles before, so it doesn't surprise me that he might issue buggy software.

&lt;br /&gt;Dave really was a pioneer in software, and it's wrongheaded to denigrate his actual accomplishments. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Somewhere along the way, the Founding Father became the Juvenile Delinquent of the Internet, upsetting the community with his abusive outbursts. He seems to have no shame.                                            
&lt;br /&gt;Umberto Llama's wife said," Dave is a smart guy, but he has a social IQ of 0".
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And his Google karma is really funny. I wonder if there's a relationship between his social IQ and his page rankings? I'm working on an equation.

&lt;br /&gt;to create his persona:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;the nerdish hipster.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;It's spoiled by his penchant for abusive outbursts, followed by a revisionist calm.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Give Winer a fat cigar and some coke,
&lt;br /&gt;and you have a reasonable facsimile of
&lt;br /&gt;Sigmund Freud,
&lt;br /&gt;minus the human insight.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Now, if Dave wants to do some really serious
&lt;br /&gt;myth creation, a la Mark Twain,
&lt;br /&gt;he needs to write his autobiography.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Just stuff it as full of bullshit as possible,
&lt;br /&gt;like a hot sausage into its casing,
&lt;br /&gt;till it's near bursting...
&lt;br /&gt;and be sure to throw in a few statuesque "babes", Dave.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Who knows?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Maybe you can even work Joan Baez into it, somehow.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Will you put Leonardo di Caprio in it,

&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see the latter on the axis user mail list, where users complain that they are getting a 'connection refused' error, AxisFault 'HttpResponse:404' or 'ClassNotFoundException'and can somebody please help them. These people should not be helped. There is an informal mountaineering rule that you never help incompetents up a mountain to killed higher up, only down, to get out alive. Wannabe SOAP developers should be told to work through Bruce's TIJ book, TCP Illustrated, RFC2516, Hunter's Servlets, Box and Skonnard on XML and then maybe write a first web service. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;First of all, I love the analogy. But I have to admit I go back and forth on this one a lot. As a trainer, I run into a lot of developers who probably shouldn't be writing software. At a guess, I'd say it's about 25% of them. They'll never get it. &lt;a href="http://rover.cs.northwestern.edu/~surana/blog/archives/000079.html"&gt;The worst of them actually think they're good&lt;/a&gt;. Around 5% are really quite smart - these people will create software worth using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But that leaves 70%: what do we do with them? It's a real conundrum: systems are getitng larger, more complex, and therefore harder to do right, regardless of what vendors want you to believe. You can't do SOAP right without understanding XML, and surveys of classes find that very few developers claim to understand even XML namespaces. Security? Forget it - few can tell you the difference between signing and encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There are several possibilities: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Yell "screw it!" and gather a team of only the smartest people to build stuff. Obviously, not everyone can do this. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Give up. Go into hotel and restaurant management. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Come up with some new way of doing things that enables the middle 70% to Do Things Right. I know I'm not smart enough to pull this one off. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Go with the old saying, "Educate the able, console the rest". &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I'm somewhere in the neighborhood of the last one. As a consultant, I try argue strongly for what I feel is the right approach right up to the point where it's obvious that no one is going to change their mind. At that point, I just implement what the client has asked for, hoping that I've eroded their assumptions a little and maybe incrementally improved the product. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>676</id><published>2003-04-22T04:08:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-04-22T04:08:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">Every industry has a middle 70%.

The distribution of talent and competence is likely to stay constant into the future.  If we want to be able to build and maintain complex systems we have to find ways to enable the ordinary we have to do that.  At my current company structured analysis/development/qa procedures are used to enforce a minimum "quality floor" to the code that is produced - a level of quality which it is difficult to fall beneath.  This however is not the answer in my opinion for several reasons.  On principal, I dont believe the minimum is acceptable.  I also see procedures being used by managers and developers to avoid taking action and responsibility.  The procedural solution works by making the all valleys not to deep and cutting off all of the mountain tops.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="675"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>679</id><published>2003-04-23T00:45:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-04-23T00:45:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">XML Is a Virus</title><content type="html">&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the beginning, there was the .INI file.  Then, Microsoft created the Registry, and only an idiot would ever store configuration in some text file just lying around on disk.  Then, Microsoft brought us .NET, and .NET brought us .config.  We're back to .INI files, they're just XML .INI files.  And, you can use an &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.develop.com/devresources/resourcedetail.aspx?type=t&amp;amp;id=864" title="http://www.develop.com/devresources/resourcedetail.aspx?type=t&amp;amp;id=864"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XPathNavigator to search the registry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;How weird is that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0117167/2003/04/22.html#a258 "&gt;Clever post.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>680</id><published>2003-04-24T06:58:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-04-24T06:58:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Another Sort of SOAP</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here's what the &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard-core web service zealots play when they're not working: &lt;a href="http://www.wingnutgames.com/soap.htm"&gt;SOAP&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>681</id><published>2003-04-24T08:41:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-04-24T08:41:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Richard Blewett Joins the Fold</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My friend and fellow DevelopMentor instructor Richard Blewett now has a blog.

I suggested that she ditch the hash idea and just generate random numbers. It's pretty much the same thing, after all, since she was going to be storing the lookup information in a database anyway. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Her first (and fairly natural) reaction was "What about collisions?" After thinking about it for a second, she remembered that a hash isn't guaranteed to be unique - how can you come up with a one-to-one mapping from all possible four-page documents to a single 32-bit number? - so she had to have the code in place to check for duplicates anyway.

They will, of course, tell you when it's slow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I'm not saying that Ted is claiming that OO == maintainable. But I think there's a general perception out there that this is the case. Our notions of "well designed" or "elegant" code have come to encompass the bill of goods that the OO purists sold us in the 1990s. But that's an aesthetic metric, and therefore a subjective one. I ask the question: is there something about OO that is inherently more maintaintable than a well-designed procedural system? I'm not sure there is. And when you combine the performance issues with objects in distributed systems with the fact that &lt;em&gt;everyone &lt;/em&gt;gets procedural programming but OO takes like three years to penetrate your brain properly, the picture starts to get even more muddy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I'm not saying that objects are bad. I'm just saying, they don't equal goodness. And linear programming doesn't equal badness.

        So I've been playing around with the Beta of Microsoft OneNote (part of Office 2003) this
        evening, and I have to say I really like it. The shortcut keys seem very natural (e.g.
        Ctrl-T to jump to the title) and the organization just makes sense to me. I haven't
        been able to find anything yet that I've wanted to do but haven't been able to. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Wait - just thought of something...is there a way to link notes across sections? I'd
        like to be able to write a note and then have it show up in several different sections...

        &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intrapersonal thinkers:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;

            &lt;em&gt;Spend a lot of time thinking about and trying to understand themselves &lt;/em&gt;

            &lt;em&gt;Reflect on their thoughts and moods, and work to improve them &lt;/em&gt;

    &lt;br /&gt;
    Sigmund Freud, Gandhi, Grahame Greene&lt;br /&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        I don't know if you've ever done this or not, but if you go into "My Network Places"
        in an explorer instance, you can add a new "Network Place". This allows you to do
        the equivalent of mapping a network drive, but over HTTP. I've found this useful in
        the past for transferring really large files that won't make it through the email
        system. All someone has to to is map to my server this way and then drag and drop
        the file in explorer - voila! It transfers the darn thing. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        This was particularly useful at home last week, since I needed to get some special
        files for my new gig (more on this when I find out how much I can say about it). Since
        I have cable, with its large downstream bandwidth, having someone push the files to
        me made sense. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        It wasn't easy, though. You might have seen over on &lt;a href="http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/archives/003089.shtml"&gt;Brad's
        Blog&lt;/a&gt; that I was having some issues getting it set up. Well, here's the whole
        sequence I had to go through: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        0) &lt;strong&gt;Create a new virtual directory.&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure it has "write"
        permissions. Make sure the NETWORK SERVICE account has write permission in the physical
        directory. (NETWORK SERVICE is the IIS6 equivalent of IUSR_MachineName, which - although
        still present - is not used.) 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        1) &lt;strong&gt;Enable WebDAV.&lt;/strong&gt; Open up the IIS admin tool and surf to the "Web
        Service Extensions" folder. "Allow" WebDAV. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        2) &lt;strong&gt;Enable FrontPage Extensions&lt;/strong&gt;. Same place - "Allow" FrontPage
        Server Extensions. You'll also need to do a "Configure Server Extensions" on the virtual
        directory that you created in step 0. This will pop open a web page that lets you
        create the new FP subweb. Keep it open when you're done. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        3) &lt;strong&gt;Set up a FrontPage user.&lt;/strong&gt; Using the same FrontPage admin interface,
        set up a FrontPage user and give them "author" permission. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The client should now be able to do a "add network place". Horribly obscure steps
        to get it set up, if you ask me, but very convenient once you get it going. 
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        I've had a GPS for years - it's a fun toy even though I don't use it much any more.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        One of the great things I like to do is to hook it up to my computer. This has several
        uses. For example, I can mount the GPS on my mountain bike, take a ride, and later
        download the coordinates as a text file. Of course, a series of numeric latitudes
        and longitudes isn't particularly illuminating, but it's a matter of minutes to pull
        it into Excel, and from there into MapPoint. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        If you've never used MapPoint before, you're missing out. It's part of an MSDN subscription
        (can't remember what level), so it's free if you're already paying for that. It's
        basically like the online version of MapPoint, but local, so performance is way better.
        And it goes well beyond the simple route plotting capabilities of the online version
        in terms of number of stops, choosing which routes to follow (e.g. avoid toll roads),
        and other things. You can even import information into it from Excel, allowing you
        do to things like plot a GPS track on a map. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        There's direct GPS integration, too. MapPoint will display your current position on
        the map if you have a GPS connected that can do NMEA (most of them). I've used this
        from time to time to figure out where I was in a strange city. But since it requires
        looking at the laptop screen, it's really not appropriate for use from the road. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Well, the other day someone mentioned &lt;a href="http://www.delorme.com/streetatlas2003/default.asp"&gt;Delorme
        Street Atlas&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, this thing works much like MapPoint, but it will actually
        speak directions to you! "Turn left ahead." That sort of thing. According to their
        website, &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; can even talk to &lt;strong&gt;it&lt;/strong&gt;. As in, "Where
        am I?" And it'll answer. I haven't tried it, but I've heard from at least one satisfied
        customer. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Very cool - I want one. 
    &lt;/p&gt;

He didn't get what the big         deal was. I told him I used to think the same way until I started doing it and realized         the huge advantage the one-to-many form has over many-to-many styles like mailing         lists. I said I'd get him started with one.      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         I run my own blog, of course, but Kevin doesn't have access to a site like staff.develop.com         that I do, nor the knowledge to set up something like BlogX. He is fairly computer-saavy,         but since he's thinking about getting some of his collegues (he's a forensic chemist         for a sheriff's department in the LA area) into blogging, I thought we'd try to find         some site where everything is all set up for you.      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         My first stop was Blogger.com - it's a big name and I figured they'd be a reasonable         choice. Unfortunately, I discovered that they don't have support for automatic RSS         generation. Which is half the point, in my opinion. So I went out searching for other         free services that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; support it. I got dozens of hits on Google, but couldn't         find what I was looking for after about half an hour of plowing through them.      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         So if you know of a good place for my brother to set up a non-computer-related blog         (that includes RSS), let me know by leaving a comment. Thanks!      &lt;/p&gt; </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>53</thr:total></entry><entry><id>695</id><published>2003-05-06T10:05:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-05-06T10:05:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">I personally use MovableType (http://www.movabletype.org), and I really like it - very powerful, lots of tags for configurability, etc.  Although it requires your own server with Perl installed, they recently announced a service called TypePad (http://www.typepad.com) which is basically Blogger, but powered by MT (as I understand it).

I'm tired to see no good site with blog like Movable Type!"
I think it is unreasonable to criticize blog so.
It isn't a problem with the property of blog, but the use of blog.

And I agree - I'd rather read a badly formatted blog with good content than a pretty blog with nothing to say.

I think I found exactly what you were looking for.
It's called Erablog.net (http://erablog.net)
It's free, it's simple and fast to set up and it comes with an RSS 0.91,RSS 1.0 and categories.
You can also use w.bloggar to post to it which supports WMP and Winamp [Listening] feature.
The only issue is that the RSS feed is plain text and is not HTML formatted. I need to talk to Mike about this as it doesn't look really good in SharpReader and I imagine in other aggregators.
You can try my blog at http://erablog.net/blogs/CineBlogDOTNet/ and tell me what you think.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="694"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>701</id><published>2003-05-08T03:31:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-05-08T03:31:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">Oh, Erablog.net sounds great!

    &lt;p&gt;
        Last week I started a new consulting engagement at Microsoft. I was hoping to be able
        to tell you all about it, but first I had to find out what it was okay for me to say.
        Well, yesterday I got the answer to that question, so here's what I can tell you about
        the project: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I'm doing work for MSDN. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        And that, unfortunately, is all I'm able to disclose. But it's a cool project, so
        I don't mind too much. And who knows? Maybe as time goes by I'll be able to say more.

        &lt;a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106747"&gt;Scott Hanselman&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106747/2003/05/07.html#a306"&gt;this
        tip&lt;/a&gt; for users of PowerPoint: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When a slide is selected in PowerPoint (either in Normal or Slide
    Sorter), while F5 will start the slide show at the FIRST slide, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;pressing
    Shift-F5 will start the slide show at the CURRENTLY SELECTED slide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/blockquote&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;
        Oh. My. God. I know this isn't a big deal for some of you, but if you use PowerPoint
        as much as most DM instructors do...
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        This is like finding out that your car has a "hover" button under the dashboard.

More PowerPoint tips for you: 

* When the slide show is running, type a slide number (e.g. 23) and hit return to jump to that slide. 
* Hit 'b' to turn the screen black
* Hit 'w' to turn the screen white
* Ctrl-P turns on the pen

        a splash. He's a good guy, so I'll help indulge him by encouraging everyone to check

        interesting nugget&lt;/a&gt;. It's a short description of the upcoming support for generics
        (aka templates) in the CLR. It looks pretty cool. And although I'm a huge fan of staying
        away from code that's too clever for its own good (which is why I was never fond of
        C++ templates), I have to admit there have been a few times lately when having generics
        would have been nice.

To me, there is something liberating about not knowing what T is; it forces me to focus on one thing that should matters most when writing code: algorithm.

I would not, however, apply that term to C++ templates. 

I remember being called in on a project one time. The designer had made extensive use of templates. I had a hard time parsing it, so I asked one of the developers, "So, do you understand the code you're working with?" The answer was, "Well, I think the designer does..." I got the same answer from the next two developers I'd asked. I stopped wondering why they were two years overdue. 

These were reasonably smart guys - I just think that the elegance that templates can add is often offset by the cognitive overhead they introduce. Hopefully the generics stuff will be easier to comprehend, because I am a huge proponent of "easy" over "clever". </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="717"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>722</id><published>2003-05-11T06:13:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-05-11T06:13:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Can You Feel the Web Shifting?</title><content type="html">

He's also blogging his experiences         with various apps - what works, what doesn't. I did something similar a while         back (see &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/2003/02/14/craigsApplist.html"&gt;Craig's         AppList&lt;/a&gt;). The list is slightly out of date now, but since I switched from Radio,         I don't have a good way to generate long-form content, and rather than edit the list         in-place, I'd rather spend my time writing my content generation system.      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         In the meantime, let me share something I learned along these lines.

I think - but didn't nail it down - that it's         dynamically registering CLSIDs at runtime. But here's the thing: it only does it when         you pop up the UI. The bit that actually runs things works fine.      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         So what you wind up having to do is to run WinKey as admin, set up all your shortcuts,         then export HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Copernic Technologies\WinKey\Shortcuts and         re-import it under your non-admin account.      &lt;/p&gt;      </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>728</id><published>2003-05-15T05:27:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-05-15T05:27:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">How to Ask Questions the Smart Way</title><content type="html">

I saw a lot of FUD and "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" reasoning. I saw people complaining about a productivity hit you incur - I've been developing as a non-Admin for weeks now with no appreciable productivity loss.

Yes, running as a non-admin user will not catch every single bug. But one must remember that the cost of fixing a bug escalates after it leaves the developer's machine, so why not go ahead and use this as a tool to catch permission-related bugs *before* they become bugs? You'll be amazed at how many things the framework automagically stuffs into restricted sections of the registry on your behalf. If you didn't develop/debug as a non-admin, you could easily tear your hair out trying to repro a problem a user is seeing when it's related to oh, say, and event log source being registered when the EventLog class can't find it.

Yes, security is not a feature most people think to request. So, gee, if they don't ask for it, let's just ignore it. That sounds like the reasoning Microsoft was using until recently, and look at how much money is being spent to catch up. Sure, DM is a consulting firm, so one could make the short-sighted statement that "if it's not in the statement of work, it doesn't get worked on." That's the kind of attitude that gives consultants a bad name. Sure, if you pay attention to security, the client may not notice.

The first time it was done it was a mind-bending statement that opened your mind to a new way of thinking about music and sound. Yet it wasn't something that could be emulated or continued any further. In a sense, running as non-admin is something all developers should try for at least some time just to open your mind to that other world. But continuing productivity shouldn't be sacrificed to make this point. If you need to thoroughly test your application in a non-admin world then make sure you have VMWare ro Virtual PC running an OS without those privileges and run unit tests against that environment regularly to ensure you are abiding by the necessary regulations and your application performs adequately. But to state that developers need to always run as non-admin is to state the John Cage started a movement that should be done at every performance. The point was made with one simple performance... now move-on with your newfound knowledge.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="732"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>735</id><published>2003-05-16T09:01:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-05-16T09:01:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">Agree - and I don't think anyone was saying, "Everyone *should* always run as admin."

My idea was to write a visual simulation of this. From there I started         diving into Direct3D, writing a generic simulation engine that would bounce notional         particles off of one another and model gravitational attraction. But since it was         just a side project I had going I didn't take it too far.      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         A month or two later, Chris Sells asked me if I'd be interested in writing an article         for the Intel website, as part of a series he was editing. The idea was to demonstrate         how big-ass CPUs were still important in a web service world. I thought, "Here's a         great chance to get paid to finish working on that idea." Because if there are two         things that can suck CPU, they are simulations and 3D graphics.      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         Chris had given me until December to finish the article, which I did. It was fairly         challenging, as I had to learn a lot about Direct3D in the process. I turned in the         article, submitted my invoice, and waited for it to show up on their site.      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         And waited. And waited.      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         Five months later, after emailing Intel roughly every other week, we were finally         able to cut through all the red tape. A check is supposedly in the mail. And today         I went to see if the article is there. It is! &lt;a href="http://cedar.intel.com/cgi-bin/ids.dll/content/content.jsp?cntKey=Generic+Editorial%3a%3athreading_3d_rendering&amp;amp;cntType=IDS_EDITORIAL&amp;amp;catCode=DCK"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;.The         code is &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig/IntelArticleCode.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         And I will not be writing for Intel again any time soon.      &lt;/p&gt; </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>738</id><published>2003-05-18T18:17:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-05-18T18:17:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Off the NonAdmin Wagon </title><content type="html">
    &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            There’s
            been a lot of talk about developers not running as admin. I’ve been successfully
            doing it for a few months now. Tonight I hit my first real roadblock: Quicken. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            So far, I have
            been unable to get Quicken running as non-admin. Or rather, I have been unable to
            get it running correctly. It starts just fine, but then starts to act all screwy,
            like showing me the online registration dialog, but never coming back once I hit “Next”. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Needless to say,
            this doesn’t exactly fill me with confidence. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Anyway, managing
            my finances currently outweighs my desire to join this (IMO) important effort to raise
            developer consciousness about security issues. Especially because my new wife and
            I are trying to merge our finances, and that’s a task in and of itself without
            throwing in wrestling with poorly designed software. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Intuit: shame
            on you for writing such an important piece of software (it manages what is quite literally
            the most important data on any of my computers) and not getting this right. It’s
            too bad that using MS Money isn’t an option for us or I’d switch based
            on this alone. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I’m hoping
            that once I get Quicken all set up and happy, and it’s done writing to HKLM
            or whatever stupid thing it’s doing, that I can switch back to being non-admin.
            But for now, I’m off the wagon. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

One of the things that may factor into the problem is that I'm running on Windows 2003, which almost certainly wasn't on the list of supported platforms for Quicken 2002. So that part may be my fault. 

At any rate, the bit that's not working for me looks like it might be related to setting up Internet access. Now that I've got that configured, I'll see if I can flip back to non admin at some point.

I agree with Craig. Getting work done is primary. But if you have some spare cycles, Craig, do let us know what the problem was.

Frankly, it came down to complete frustration over needing it to work *right now* and not having the time to flip through the 200 different things that one can try when troubleshooting problems of this nature.

I only ran the security-related checks, but there are checks for memory usage, locks,             stack allocation, and a bunch of other things. &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             &lt;span style=""&gt;Thanks for the link, Raj!  &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>751</id><published>2003-05-20T12:33:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-05-20T12:33:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">Thanks for the link.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="750"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>752</id><published>2003-05-22T04:38:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-05-22T04:38:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">A Security Haiku</title><content type="html">     &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="; font-style:italic"&gt;Quicken was broken&lt;br /&gt;             When running as non-admin&lt;br /&gt;             Now it’s working again&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             &lt;span style=""&gt;So apparently whatever stupid, administrative-privilege-needing thing Quicken             was doing was a startup issue, because now that I’ve used it a few times and             configured everything, I’ve been able to go back to my non-admin ways.

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;There has been &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;remarkably&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; little
            media discussion about the upcoming FCC decision, which looks set to pave the way
            for further homogenization of the media market. Pretty much everyone except giant
            media companies appears to think this is a bad idea. Especially interesting is &lt;a title="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/22/opinion/22SAFI.html?th" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/22/opinion/22SAFI.html?th"&gt;this
            opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; on the NY Times website (signup required, but it’s free and
            worth it, IMO). My friend Jeff pointed it out to me. His favorite quote (and mine): &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in"&gt;
            &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=";font-style:italic"&gt;The concentration of power — political,
            corporate, media, cultural — should be anathema to conservatives. The diffusion
            of power through local control, thereby encouraging individual participation, is the
            essence of federalism and the greatest expression of democracy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;In other words: there’s reason for both Democrats and Republicans
            to hate this idea.  &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;After getting pretty well fed up with the extreme email latency I’ve
            been dealing with on and off this week (imagine trying to sync source code with someone
            by email when it takes twenty hours to arrive), I decided to set up my own email server.
            I didn’t have too much in mind other than that it should be free. Fortunately,
            I’m already using &lt;a href="http://no-ip.com/"&gt;no-ip.com&lt;/a&gt; to get a free
            DNS name, and they have the ability to add MX records, so it was really just a matter
            of installing an SMTP/POP3 server. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;My first stop was to try the stuff that’s built into the OS,
            of course. Windows 2003 now comes with both SMTP &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; POP3
            servers. But for whatever reason, I couldn’t get them working. I’m (fairly)
            sure they &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; work, but I couldn’t
            figure out how to do it. Oh well – I knew there are free programs out there,
            so I went off in search of something decent. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;My next stop was &lt;a href="http://www.pmail.com/"&gt;Mercury&lt;/a&gt;. It looked
            like a nice product, and it installed easily. But it appears to run as a standalone
            app, not as a service. If there’s a toggle somewhere that gets it to run as
            a service, I couldn’t find it. Then again, I didn’t look that long. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;My final selection was &lt;a href="http://www.mailenable.com/"&gt;Mail Enable&lt;/a&gt;.
            Bingo! Runs as a service, has a really easy to understand user interface, supports
            an unlimited number of domains and emails, and basically has just enough features
            to fit what I want to use it for. Plus, the latest update was like three weeks ago,
            which is always good to see, as it indicates someone is still working on the thing.
            It even has mailing list capabilities. Very nice.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;One of the ways I plan to use it is to make up addresses to hand out
            to websites. Because you can define a catch-all account that all mail goes to, what
            I can do is make up an account like “amazon-spam@mydomain.com” and hand
            that out to only to Amazon. I’ll still get the mail, but if I start getting
            unsolicited email from other people on that address, I’ll know where it came
            from. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;Anyway, so far I like it. We’ll see what happens after I’ve
            had it running for a few weeks. If anyone has any experience with the product that
            they’d like to share, comments are, of course, welcome. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

I to use No-Ip and have mailenable running on my server.  I have a static IP, and Mail Enable is working fine for my web app.  My issue is that when I try to send an email to my Road Runner account from the Mail Enable account it gets blocked with the following error.

http://security.rr.com/mail_blocks.htm#security - 20031205

This error indicates one of the following: 

The sending machine or network has a security problem associated with it, which resulted in the sending of unsolicited bulk mail to our subscribers or role accounts. 

The sending machine or network is actively attacking our mail servers (mailbomb, DoS attack, etc). 

The sending machine or network is located within a dynamically assigned IP address pool, and the ISP owning that pool has a stated "no server" policy. 

The sending machine or network is not in compliance with Road Runner's posted Inbound Sending Policies 

Can you help?

&lt;br /&gt;Stumbled upon your blog and see that you are trying out mailenable.  I host 2 websites and I use the free version of mailenable for the email for these websites.  These sites are ecom sites and we get and send a lot of email.  I have been using mailenable for about 15 months with out fail!  That's right, a free email server that has run with out errors (knock on wood) for well over a year.  In short, it great, easy to use and has basic spam filtering; I just love it.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="755"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>18934</id><published>2006-02-19T20:17:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-02-19T20:17:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Mail Enable</title><content type="html">I would like to know how to use mail enable.

    &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;Like many programmers, I subscribe to a handful of fairly active mailing
            lists. After a while, you start to recognize names, since something like 90% of the
            traffic on a list comes from the same 5% of the membership. Read a little longer,
            and you can even sort of get to know people you’ve never met in person. &lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;One guy I recognize from various lists is Thomas Tomiczek. He clearly
            has substantial technical knowledge, but I’d always written him off as, well,
            a jerk. He tends to write things like this: &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in"&gt;
            &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;font-style:italic"&gt;Well, frankly - a very
            ignorant attitude.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;I myself generally try never to use words like “ignorant”
            when replying to people in a public forum, and seeing these types of comments from
            Thomas over and over again really colored my opinion of him, to the point where I
            found myself reluctant to contribute when &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;had
            questions. A recent conversation I had put the whole thing into a different light. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;My wife started her career at a company that has a very high percentage
            of international employees. Many of these people are now in her (and by extension,
            my) social circle. It’s a rare gathering where I’m &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; the
            only white American male present. Unsurprisingly, the conversation occasionally turns
            to the differences between American culture and others. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;One comment in particular caught my attention. A French friend of mine
            was talking about how it was very difficult to get accustomed to American workplace
            attitudes towards criticism. In his experience, Americans are unabashed cheerleaders
            of each other. This contrasted sharply with his experience in France. For example,
            in France his manager would have no hesitation over calling him on even relatively
            small errors. Even grudging compliments were high praise. In contrast, he was taken
            aback when – in the US – he performed some routine task adequately and
            got a hearty “Good job!” from his supervisor. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;From Thomas’s emails, I can tell that English isn’t his
            first language. So it makes me view his emails in a new light: rather than being unnecessarily
            harsh, I can see where he might view them as being simply unabashedly honest.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;I don’t have to tell anyone reading this that email is an inexact
            medium for expressing information with intent. Even the emoticon-laden messages that
            I find myself occasionally embarrassed to be the author of can only convey so much
            out-of-band information. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;

Now I certainly *would* agree that the community (say the OT list) is going to form its own culture, and that if someone repeatedly steps outside the boundaries set by that culture - regardless of how it measures up to their own background - they shouldn't be too surprised if no one wants to talk to them any more. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="759"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>763</id><published>2003-05-26T09:18:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-05-26T09:18:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">He is a jerk.

I have often wondered how many people avoid asking questions (and thereby lose the opportunity to learn) simply because they don't want to get flamed by someone like Thomas for trying to understand.

This is a common failing amongst the geek community; for some reason, several of us seem to have used the brain-space normally reserved for courtesy to store code snippets. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="759"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>768</id><published>2003-05-28T00:37:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-05-28T00:37:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">In response to Andy's post, my question is this: 

Is 'there are no dumb questions' truly a universal? 

I mean, clearly, we need to draw the line somewhere. Questions like, "How do I send email?" are noise in a forum like one of the DM lists. I personally wouldn't call someone out for asking a question like that once, but what if they did it twenty times? A hundred? Three? 

What I'm saying is that if there's a line, everyone would likely draw it in a different place, and that where you draw it is influenced by your culture. Is it ever influenced strongly enough that 'flaming' someone (another subjective term) is justified after one post? Again, *I* would say no, but is that just my culture talking? 

I honestly don't know the answer - I just like to think about the question when I'm tempted to write someone off. Of course, ultimately, some people still need to be written off. :) </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="759"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>769</id><published>2003-05-28T12:03:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-05-28T12:03:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">I thought a bit about this before I decided to post, so here it goes.

&lt;br /&gt;I never heard of Thomas before, but I was angered by the way Thomas acted towards this programmer and decided to Google him. You can see the way Thomas berates him all through this post. I really just wanted to smack this guy. Thankfully this thread allowed me to blow off some steam knowing I wasn't the only one who felt that way. :-)

&lt;br /&gt;Thomas: But you know how to read documentation?

&lt;br /&gt;Thomas: Reading some good books is a
&lt;br /&gt;way more efficient way to get knowledge than running around and asking questions for which you actually don't have the knowledge to understand the answer. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Thomas: Hm - you know how to click the hyperlinks, right? Just wondering.

&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately his company thona-consulting.com went to insolvency. I hope this guy has disappeared 4ever from the stage of german IT-business! He always was a bad example of german behavior. Therefore I wouldn't take his statements towards craig and other foreign programmers, because he cannot be a measure for a well behaved and well educated german citizen. In Germany we call such person "Unterschicht" translated to english that means the underclass.

Thomas is a dick.  He likes thinking of himself as superior and he trolls groups and posts just to show off his technical acumen but also, in turn, shows off his technical frailties, of which there are many (as there are in all of us, please).  How dare he put down good ideas that don't jive with his own as ignorant.  That just speaks volumes about his own insecurities.  I can just imagine him on the playground as some skinny little boy who's too smart for everybody else and never gets any play, so he lashes out.

To play devil's advocate, I think that the radio is far more diverse now than 20 years ago, if you include internet radio and XM.  I don't have direct experience with XM, but I think it's akin to satellite TV in that I can get stations from around the world in every media market.

Also, I assume this is Shane, brother of Tad? Or a different Shane? 

I agree that if you include Internet and maybe satellite, it's way more diverse. However, Internet stations are disappearing at a rapid rate, and satellite is in its infancy. Also, neither of them helps me much in my car, which is where I think many people listen. Plus, is "oh, there's this other stuff you can use when it's convenient" really provide an excuse for dominance by one or two media companies in the other 90% of the market? 

In any event, if you look at trends, increasing consolidation is the pattern. Right now Satellite is on the upswing, but give it ten years and I guarantee that ClearChannel will own most of the stations, with the same disasterous effect on diversity. Internet may provide some outlet, but until broadband is a reality for more and a clear business model is developed, we need to defend against monopoly. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="774"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>777</id><published>2003-05-30T05:10:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-05-30T05:10:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Nanog and Pluripotency </title><content type="html">

            &lt;span style=""&gt;As part of my occasional “science in the morning” postings: &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="; font-style:italic"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; had &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A55817-2003May29.html?nav=hptop_tb"&gt;this
            article&lt;/a&gt; this morning, describing an exciting discovery in the field of cell biology.
            Originally published in &lt;a href="http://www.cell.com/content/article/abstract?uid=PIIS0092867403003933"&gt;this
            article&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, it
            seems that scientists have discovered a gene that plays a crucial role in letting
            mouse stem cells develop into any other cell. The property to develop into skin, liver,
            brain, nerve, or whatever other type of cells is called &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;pluripotency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,
            and understanding how it works may be crucial to developing new treatments for everything
            from paralysis to old age. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;The gene has been dubbed &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;nanog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,
            a reference to the mythical Celtic fairy land of Tir Nan Og, a land of eternal youth.
            If scientists are successful in the logical next step of the experiments – being
            able to create human stem cells from any cell in the body – that name could
            be prophetic: this technology may have the potential to lengthen the human lifespan
            to near-immortality. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;I was writing some code Friday, and I realized I was working with three
            of my favorite namespaces all at once: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;System.IO&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;System.Xml,&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;System.Diagnositcs&lt;/span&gt;.
            Most people will have used all of these namespaces at least once, but there are a
            bunch of hidden gems that not everyone will have seen. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;The task I was trying to pull off was to dump an XML document for debugging
            purposes. I wanted to send it both to the console and to a logfile, to give me a real-time
            idea of what was going on as well as a permanent record I could go back and analyze
            later. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;The ability to write a piece of information to more than one place
            for diagnostic purposes just cries out for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;System.Diagnostics.Trace&lt;/span&gt;.
            So I started my program off with the following lines of code: 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=";font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;using System;&lt;br /&gt;
            using System.IO; 
            &lt;br /&gt;
            using System.Diagnostics; 
            &lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;
            public class App&lt;br /&gt;
            {&lt;br /&gt;
              public static void Main()&lt;br /&gt;
              {&lt;br /&gt;
                Trace.Listeners.Add(&lt;br /&gt;
                  new TextWriteTraceListener(Console.Output)); 
            &lt;br /&gt;
                string logfile =&lt;br /&gt;
                  DateTime.Now.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd-hh-mm-ss")
            + ".txt"; 
            &lt;br /&gt;
                Trace.Listeners.Add(&lt;br /&gt;
                  new TextWriteTraceListener(logfile); &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;which sets it up so that any time I call &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;Trace.WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;,
            a piece of text is written both to the command console and to a logfile whose name
            is derived from the current date and time. The overload of &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;ToString&lt;/span&gt; that
            lets you specify the exact format for the date and time is pretty cool, I think. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;Later, when I wanted to actually dump the XML, I did this: &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=";font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;StringWriter sw = new StringWriter(); 
            &lt;br /&gt;
            XmlTextWriter wtr = new XmlTextWriter(sw); 
            &lt;br /&gt;
            wtr.Formatting = Formatting.Indented; 
            &lt;br /&gt;
            xml.WriteTo(wtr); 
            &lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;
            Trace.WriteLine(sw.ToString()); 
            &lt;br /&gt;
            wtr.Close(); &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;where xml is the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;XmlDocument&lt;/span&gt; that
            I wanted to dump out. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;There are a number of cool things in these few lines of code: &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2"&gt;
            &lt;span style=";font-family:Symbol"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-list:Ignore"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;StringWriter&lt;/span&gt; class
            give you a stream that  you can use anywhere you’d use a normal &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;TextWriter&lt;/span&gt; (e.g.
            the constructor of &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;XmlTextWriter&lt;/span&gt;),
            but it writes to an internally maintained &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/span&gt; instead.
            Handy. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2"&gt;
            &lt;span style=";font-family:Symbol"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-list:Ignore"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;Formatting&lt;/span&gt; property
            of &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;XmlTextWriter&lt;/span&gt; to get that nice “every
            nested element gets indented one level” look. Makes for much more readable output. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2"&gt;
            &lt;span style=";font-family:Symbol"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-list:Ignore"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Of
            course, the call to &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;Trace.WriteLine&lt;/span&gt; to
            actually spew this same XML to more than once place. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;A few caveats: &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1"&gt;
            &lt;span style=";font-family:Symbol"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-list:Ignore"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;You
            need to define the symbol TRACE in your build (Project Properties-&amp;gt;Configuration
            Properties-&amp;gt;Build-&amp;gt;Conditional Compilation Constants – just type in TRACE)
            or &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;Trace.WriteLine&lt;/span&gt; will not even make
            it into the compiled program. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1"&gt;
            &lt;span style=";font-family:Symbol"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-list:Ignore"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I
            found that I needed to go through and flush each trace listener independently, or
            my log file would get truncated. That was easy, though: just a foreach loop over the &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;Trace.Listeners&lt;/span&gt; collection,
            calling &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;Flush&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;Close&lt;/span&gt; on
            each &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;TraceListenener&lt;/span&gt;.  
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

If I understand this petition correctly, what it does is push the 80% or so of content that no one cares about the copyright any more into the public domain, while still giving copyright holders a really easy way to hold on to their intellectual property.

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;If you have followed any of the “Running as non-admin”
            traffic that’s been fairly prevalent of late, you’ve probably heard of
            the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;runas&lt;/span&gt; command. &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;Runas&lt;/span&gt; lets
            you  launch a process with alternate credentials in the current window station.
            Generally, you use this to do things like fire up a new instance of Visual Studio
            under administrative credentials so you can debug ASP.NET applications or something. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;Today I ran across an entirely new option: the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;/netonly&lt;/span&gt; switch.
            Using it means that the credentials you supply &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;don’t
            have to be valid on the machine you’re running it on, but will still be passed
            on when remote calls are made!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;So
            cool. Why? Because I’m doing work with Microsoft, and I need to do things against
            their servers that require authentication. I don’t want to join my machine to
            their domain, which means I can’t get a process running under my Microsoft domain
            account. However, using this switch, I can make a process look to remote systems as
            if it were running under my Microsoft domain account. This turned out to be crucially
            important for getting our build process working on my machine. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;The one caveat is that since it doesn’t do an actual login, it’ll
            take whatever password you throw at it. Even if it’s wrong – you won’t
            find out until you try to actually use those credentials. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

My domain account is a non-admin on my machine. The only admin account I have is the local Administrator, which obviously does not have priviledges on network resources. So, when I want to set up an app from a network share, I usually do two RUNASes.

runas /u:LOCALMACHINE\Administrator "cmd.exe"

and then from the command prompt that comes up:

runas /u:MYDOMAIN\rajc /netonly "cmd.exe"

and THEN run the setup from there.

I typed an XML tag here, and got a horrendous "Potentially dangerous content" error. I love ASP.NET 1.1, but a simple encode would do the trick. Do I tell you or ChrisAn ?

As is usual when I hang out with             Tim, my brain hurts from trying to keep up. &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             &lt;span style=""&gt;We had an interesting discussion over lunch yesterday. We were discussing             – among other things – how the CLR has made things so much easier than             they used to be that programmers have fallen into a death spiral of trying to abstract             everything away. The fact that you can write the same application with about 4x less             code leads us to try to cut things even further: a whole app in zero lines of code             being the ultimate experience. Obviously I’m exaggerating, but I think the phenomenon             of seeking to do things with fewer and fewer lines of code is a real one. And not             a new one – if you’ve ever seen a C++ program that got a little bit &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;too&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; clever             with preprocessor macros, you know what I mean. &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             &lt;span style=""&gt;The latest incarnation of “less is more” is the declarative             programming model popularized (in the Microsoft world) by MTS and then COM+. The idea             there was that you’d simply write your code, flip a few switches, and suddenly             all sorts of magical services would appear at your fingertips. Transactions! Synchronization!             Security! Just check a box. Or, if you’re programming in the CLR, just add an             attribute. &lt;a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0108971"&gt;Clemens Vasters&lt;/a&gt; has been             making the rounds lately showing how he has embraced this model to allow you to do             all sorts of things by simply adding attributes to your code. It sounds like a great             idea. &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             &lt;span style=""&gt;The problem is, it doesn’t work. It never has. &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             &lt;span style=""&gt;For a while, I tried to take the other side against Tim. Probably mostly             because I’d recently done a bunch of this “hide everything from the programmer”             work for a client of mine. But Tim has traveled this road for too long – after             all, he wrote the best &lt;a href="http://www.aw.com/catalog/academic/product/0,4096,0201615940,00.html"&gt;COM+             book there is&lt;/a&gt;. He made mincemeat out of my arguments. Which is hardly surprising             – I studied COM+ under Tim for years, and already agreed with him. I just needed             to be reminded. Tim pointed out a few things I already knew: &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2"&gt;             &lt;span style=";font-family:Symbol"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-list:Ignore"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;How             COM+ is fundamentally broken around synchronization and STAs         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2"&gt;             &lt;span style=";font-family:Symbol"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-list:Ignore"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;How             switching off one service in COM+ often requires you to switch off several others             (e.g. transactions and synchronization)         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             &lt;span style=""&gt;The basic problem here is that &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;services             are not generally orthogonal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;What that means is that it’s impossible             to simply slap a new behavior onto code without understanding all the other behaviors             that are already there. Don’t believe me? Then ask yourself why the CLR’s             context infrastructure has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;IsContextOK. &lt;/span&gt;This             is the method that – when implementing a new service – lets you look around             your environment and decide if you’re compatible with all the other services             that are already present. This has two basic problems:          &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level2 lfo2"&gt;             &lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;span style="mso-list:Ignore"&gt;1.&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;How             do you know if you’re compatible with a given service that didn’t even             exist when you were created?         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>10</thr:total></entry><entry><id>790</id><published>2003-06-08T07:22:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-06-08T07:22:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">I'm on the codegen train these days, but primarily for generating the low-level parts of my data architecture. In my case, I'm using it to tackle my object/relational mapping. Instead of writing thousand of lines of code for the object definitions and to handle moving my objects between the CLR and SQL worlds, I write hundreds of lines of XML describing my objects and use a script to generate the code. My own codegen engine is written with extensibility in mind - if you want different behavior in a couple of places, you can instruct the codegen engine to use a custom implementation (in my case, it's a static method on a type that is local to the assembly being generated and resides in a manually-generated code file). I have already seen the benefit of this approach first-hand: when we wanted to change the error-handling in the data access layer, I simply made a change to the codegen script and re-genned the code.

I have considered using this approach to also generate the business-logic layer, but I am currently of the opinion that the business rules require more flexibility than codegen can realistically provide. Business rules tend to be app-specific, and you'd probably spend as much time writing the codegen code to handle all of the possible combinations of rules as you would just writing the code. There is an ease-of-maintenance case to be made, though, so I'm not closing the door on it.

As far as the "the codegenned code had problems and we had to fix them by hand" argument goes, I can speculate: this was using a third-party's "black box" code generation tool. My golden rule is: never ever hand-modify automatically generated code. Doing so is 1) a recipe for a very unhappy developer and 2) very inefficient. If you find that the generated code needs fixing, fix the engine used to generate the code. If you don't personally have the source for the engine, rain fire upon the developer to fix the issue. I personally favor writing the engine yourself. If you are evaluating codegen engines, be very cautious about using shrink-wrapped packages - there's a good chance that you'll be stuck shoehorning your problem into *their* idea of how the problem should be solved.

Incidentally, templates (aka generics) will still have their place - there will always be some low-level stuff (custom typed collections being the classic example) that is served well by templates. In general, I'll be using them to make my codegen scripts shorter.

And yes, I believe you can do a LOT more with this approach to solve the problems that AOP is trying to solve.

Ack!!!!  : ) . . . I've found good success with AOP, even with orthogonal AOP with keeping aspects transparent to each other.  Though it's not as simple as slapping some attributes on a class interface.  Basically I create an Aspect "pipeline" using a context bound object and coresponding attribute.  This AopPipleineAttribute is the only ContextAttribute I use.  The pipeline chains the aspects together and initiates the interception processes in pretty much the same way .Net does, except I added the additional capablitiy of the pipeline being able to handle the processing order of different aspects via a tiny xml configuration file cached in memory.  I have yet to see a real world senario that this configuration can not handle.  Even if I need to customize it, I can always inject the aspect into the pipeline and expose overriding capabilities of the pipeline manager.  I've done tons of code gen and have to agree that the amount of code files that I can replace with a touch of reflection and a well thought out aspect, by far, seems to make investing time in evolving my aspect pipeline worthwhile. especially considering the orthogonal issues and contextual significance of individual aspects can be dealt with using a knowledgable installer or administrator with a configuration tool.

of course, that's just my opinion and I could be wrong ;)

We’d hiked all             day the day before, having flown in from sea level just the day before that, so we             were tired. We’d followed the trail easily enough for the first two hours of our hike             from Ouzel Lake, but now, just a mile from Thunder Lake, it sort of disintegrated             into a hundred different sets of footsteps wandering off across the thick snow cover             in all directions. We did our best to pick out the trail, but pretty soon we found             ourselves standing in the middle of the woods saying, "Now what?"&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             &lt;span&gt;It might not have been so bad if it hadn't been raining. And snowing. And hailing.             It might not even have been so bad if there had been less than four feet of snow on             the ground. Or if we were able to take more than twenty steps across said snow without             punching through to our ankles, to our knees, or even occasionally to our hips. Or             if our packs had weighed a little bit less, enabling us to crawl out of the the little             snow sinkholes more easily. &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             &lt;span&gt;I've done a fair amount of backpacking before, and I'd have to say this was             the closest I've ever been to worried. We were fortunate that we had a decent map             and knew how to read it. We were lucky that we happened to know we were between two             streams, and that the trail was somewhere downhill. And we were damn happy when we             finally found the campsite and were able to stop walking. &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             &lt;span&gt;All in all it was a great trip. And it's getting better. Like most backpacking             trips, I'm often wondering "why do I do this to myself" when I'm out there, but by             the time I get back it's already turning into a fond memory.

    &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;Bruce Schneier just published the latest issue of his newsletter “CryptoGram”,
            available &lt;a href="http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. My favorite
            bit was his link to &lt;a href="http://www.computerworld.com/mobiletopics/mobile/story/0,10801,80849,00.html"&gt;this
            story&lt;/a&gt;, wherein an Idaho police department gave their officers laptops with wireless
            access to the police network. As you may know, it’s basically trivial to crack
            a 802.11 networks, even with WEP encryption enabled. To get around this, the police
            department &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in"&gt;
            &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Arial;font-style:italic"&gt;added security by using a hard-to-crack
            proprietary encryption protocol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;This is a &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;huge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; red flag
            – secure protocols are generally &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;proprietary,
            but rather developed in the public eye where they can undergo scrutiny by a community
            of experts. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;I’ve been down this road myself – I’ve invented security
            protocols for clients only to invariably discover serious flaws in them months later
            when I came to understand the problem better. When I went back to fix the problems,
            I almost always converged on something that already existed – SSL, Kerberos,
            whatever. Just look at WEP, the wireless encryption standard – even using “128-bit
            encryption” it can be cracked in a matter of hours by freely available tools.
            And even protocols that are thought by most experts to be secure can be cracked trivially
            when they are implemented poorly. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;Rule number one in security is: &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;don’t
            invent your own&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. We’ll see how long it is before that police department
            gets bit by their mistake. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

He’s             technical, too, so we got to talking about code. I mentioned something about how I’ve             been programming a lot lately, and it detoured us into a discussion about lines of             code (LOC) metrics. &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             &lt;span style=""&gt;He brought up an interesting one that he’d heard recently. The             idea is that it’s not so much a good idea to measure how many lines of code             a developer is &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;producing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (e.g. 7 per             day), but rather how many lines of code they are &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic"&gt;responsible             for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. And that there’s an absolute maximum. In other words, once I’ve             got 50KLOC, I’m done – all my time is going to be spent in maintenance. &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             &lt;span style=""&gt;I’m not saying 50K is the number – in fact the number will             be different for different developers – but the idea that a single developer             has a capacity resonates with me. I know how hard it is to go back to things I haven’t             looked at for even a week when I’ve got a lot of stuff going. And forget about             supporting code that I wrote two years ago. &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             &lt;span style=""&gt;What does this mean? A few things, I think: &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1"&gt;             &lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;span style="mso-list:Ignore"&gt;1)&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Refactoring             is &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; important. The fewer LOC you             have, the more functionality you can support.          &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1"&gt;             &lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;span style="mso-list:Ignore"&gt;2)&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;As             you write code, you need to hire more people. Duh, but if someone can figure out the             numbers, it may help plan. Or motivate refactoring.          &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             &lt;span style=""&gt;Also, in light of &lt;a href="http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog2/PermaLink.aspx/84d013ed-cd90-446c-962a-dd4776795d74"&gt;recent             discussion&lt;/a&gt;, it begs the question: does a line of code spit out ten times by a             code generator get counted once or ten times? I’d guess the former, but it’s             an area I’d love to see experimental data on. &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>819</id><published>2003-06-19T19:15:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-06-19T19:15:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">Ping... http://weblogs.asp.net/jezell/posts/9018.aspx</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="818"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>820</id><published>2003-06-20T10:30:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-06-20T10:30:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Tim's Thoughts on AOP</title><content type="html">     &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             &lt;span style=""&gt;I’ve been bothering Tim Ewald for a while to post a followup             to my comments about AOP and code generation, since he was the one that inspired me             to write about it in the first place.

He posted his &lt;a href="http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog2/PermaLink.aspx/84d013ed-cd90-446c-962a-dd4776795d74"&gt;thoughts             on AOP&lt;/a&gt; a couple weeks ago and mentioned my work in that area. We've been carrying             on the conversation ever since, and I promised him an online response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in" class="MsoNormal"&gt;             &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=";font-style:italic"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in" class="MsoNormal"&gt;             &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=";font-style:italic"&gt;I did a ton of work with AOP when I wrote &lt;a href="http://www.aw.com/catalog/academic/product/0,4096,0201615940,00.html"&gt;Transactional             COM+&lt;/a&gt;. By the end of that project, I had reached one main conclusion: call-interception             is not a good, general purpose extensibility point. COM+ (at the time) was an             entirely closed system with a fixed set of services that could be used in conjunction             with one another. Even in that very finite universe, the interplay between the services             is quite complex. Making that universe infinitely large by allowing third parties             to mix in additional interceptors with arbitrary behaviors‚ is a mistake.             The complexity goes through the roof, because, as Craig noted, the services typically             are not orthogonal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in" class="MsoNormal"&gt;             &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=";font-style:italic"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in" class="MsoNormal"&gt;             &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=";font-style:italic"&gt;Is interceptor-based extensibility any worse than             other types of extensibility? I think so. Method-level interceptors change the path             from a call-site to a method's code. It's pretty hard to write reasonable calling             code if you don't know how method invocation actually works and it varies on a case-by-case             basis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in" class="MsoNormal"&gt;             &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=";font-style:italic"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in" class="MsoNormal"&gt;             &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=";font-style:italic"&gt;Probably the best example of the potential pitfalls             is error handling. I want to get the exceptions thrown by the methods I call. If there             are n interceptors between me and the method, that may or may not happen. Maybe an             interceptor will catch the original exception, and throw a new exception. If I don't             know that happened, how will I ever track down the real error? And what if the original             function didn't cause an exception at all, it just left the world in a state that             some interceptor didn't like? How do I know what happened? The path from a call-site             to method code should be sacred. Interceptors can alter in ways that are not clear             (and often are not documented), in essence encouraging "programming by side effect",             which is a really bad idea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in" class="MsoNormal"&gt;             &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=";font-style:italic"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in" class="MsoNormal"&gt;             &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=";font-style:italic"&gt;COM+ 1.5 added support for "Services without             Components", aka &lt;strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;CoEnterServiceDomain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and Everett exposes             this new functionality as managed code. No components means no interception, which             I like. These APIs were really designed to allow COM+ services to be deeply integrated             with low-level plumbing, but I like to use them in my own application code. Craig             and I wrote an &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/02/04/COMXP/"&gt;MSDN             Magazine piece&lt;/a&gt; about how this works. However, judging by the ratings, most readers             don't find the idea too attractive (or they just don't like our prose ;-).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>821</id><published>2003-06-20T14:38:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-06-20T14:38:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">Only problem is this post makes the same assumption everybody else makes -- that AOP == Interception.

It’s taken a lot longer than I wanted to, mostly due to my desire             to do make use of CSS, and my inexperience with that technology.

Still, I’m pretty happy with it – it already integrates             with BlogX’s referrer tracking, and soon I hope to add features like RSS feeds             for the long-form writing and deeper integration with the BlogX infrastructure. &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             &lt;span style=""&gt;If you see anything wrong with the HTML I’m producing (and I             know you will – it’s got issues) please email me at &lt;a href="mailto:candera@develop.com"&gt;candera@develop.com&lt;/a&gt; and             I’ll try to fix it.

            a roadmap around it&lt;/a&gt;. Now they’re asking people to put up their hands and
            say whether they support this or not. I support it strongly, with (a typically lengthy
            list of) caveats, amplifications and digressions....&lt;br /&gt;
            [&lt;a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/23/SamsPie"&gt;ongoing&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:-.5in"&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;The gist of it is, it might be time to pitch RSS, take the best ideas
            out of it, and start over. Given the tarball that RSS is right now, I don’t
            think this is a terrible idea. Had we done the same thing with HTML in about 1995
            (and perhaps again around 1998), we might be in better shape today. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:-.5in"&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;Certainly, the discussion on &lt;a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage"&gt;Sam’s
            Wiki&lt;/a&gt; is interesting enough to be worth noting. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://samgentile.com/blog/posts/7840.aspx"&gt;Sam&lt;/a&gt; posts
            a link to &lt;a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~lwilliam/Papers/ieeeSoftware.PDF"&gt;this
            article&lt;/a&gt; which defends the use of pair programming, where two programmers collaborate
            in front of a single computer to write software.  I’ve never tried this
            formally in a professional setting, but I do have some experience with the phenomenon:
            as an instructor I routinely write small programs in front of an audience. Anyone
            that’s done this knows that the viewers don’t have to know the technology
            you’re using very well to catch mistakes that you make. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;In addition to this, I’m involved in a project right now where
            the team is geographically distributed. I spend a lot of time on the phone, and even
            with that relatively poor communication mechanism, we’ve had good luck working
            through code together, both authoring and debugging. We got together in Minnesota
            a few weeks ago, and had even better luck when we did the same thing with the code
            up on a projection screen. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;Of course, I think one of the contributors to the productivity increase
            is that it makes you focus more. If I could write code for two hours straight on my
            own without checking email or the web – something I wouldn’t do when I’m
            using someone else’s time, too – I suspect I’d get more done. The
            paper Sam references has some quantitative results, but I’d be curious to see
            something more rigorous. And to try this approach myself some time, on some real project,
            end-to-end. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

(For instance, I'm posting this comment right now, after reading your blog entry, instead of working.)  I've certainly experienced this increased focus myself - for several months during a project (and it was quite effective.)  One (fairly small) downside is that, on your own, you might tend to pursue a solution to a problem that is not as quick in the short term, but will improve your skills - you interleave learning as a natural part of the process.  As part of a pair, I've find the focus tends to be on raw production.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="828"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>830</id><published>2003-06-26T07:41:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-06-26T07:41:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">Agreed on the downside - my transition from mostly being an instructor to mostly being a consultant has left me with a lot less latitude on learning stuff. It's been great for me - writing real code is a skill I need to hone, too - but at some point I'm going to find myself falling behind on theory, and I'll want to transition back to a lifestyle that emphasizes that. 

For working stiffs, I think the answer is that companies need to be more generous in giving people time to study abstract principles and technologies for technology's sake. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="828"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>831</id><published>2003-06-26T11:54:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-06-26T11:54:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">Well, I also agree on the "more work, less investigation" mode this style puts you in, but it has another benefit; sharing of knowledge. I have been using pair programming professionally for several years (long before I knew the practice had a name). In my case, 95% of the time it was me teaching a less experienced programmer about a technology, pattern, etc. Although it does suck time away from the senior developer, it's time well spent. Over the long run, there's a payoff: after a learning period, the other programmer spends more time being productive when you aren't pair programming (they're now familiar with the coding style, development tools, prefered patterns, etc), and it sometimes will cause a senior programmer to rethink how things are done. ("Why do you do that?" "Well, that's the way I've always done it, but now that you mention it... Let's see if we can do it a simpler way now.") In fact, I've found that I prefer working as a pair - sometimes teaching is the best way to keep learning.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="828"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>832</id><published>2003-06-27T12:36:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-06-27T12:36:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">NGEN Improvements</title><content type="html">     &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;         &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;             &lt;span style=""&gt;Jim Hogg of Microsoft posted this little nugget on &lt;a href="http://discuss.develop.com/dotnet-clr.html"&gt;the             DOTNET-CLR list&lt;/a&gt; in response to a question about how to get NGEN running as part             of a setup script. &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in"&gt;             &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=";font-style:italic"&gt;NGEN stores its results into the "Native             Image Cache" -- physically, a collection of directories below \windows\assembly             -- it's not actually the GAC, but brought to us by the same dev team. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in"&gt;             &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=";font-style:italic"&gt;Note that there's a couple of items to watch out             for with using Custom Actions to trigger ngen: they need to run during a setup phase             where it has SysAdmin privs; and as a consequence, there's a gotcha if the user disables             rollback, yet ngen fails.  (I don't understand the details: my info is second-hand).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in"&gt;             &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=";font-style:italic"&gt;Also, beware of "servicing" issues.              For example, the user upgrades his machine; or changes security policy.  In these             cases, your NGEN'd images may be rendered unusable.  In which case, the CLR will             silently fall back to JIT'ing -- so it's not a fatal disaster -- all your Apps still             work.  To guard against this, you might think about providing a small command             file that the user can run to re-NGEN your assemblies, putting Humpty Dumpty back             together again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in"&gt;             &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=";font-style:italic"&gt;(As use/importance of NGEN grows, so we're working             on making NGEN "self-healing" in the face of servicing -- for the Whidbey             release)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;             &lt;span style=""&gt;I think the most interesting part about his (very nice) response is             the last paragraph.

If you             don’t already know, NGEN is the tool that pre-compiles your assemblies, to save             the overhead of the JIT compilation that occurs at runtime. Today, NGEN isn’t             very interesting, because any change to the system rightfully invalidates the compiled             image and causes it to fall back on the regular JIT compiler. If NGEN images were             self-recreating, it could provide a performance improvement, especially around startup             times, which is where most of the JIT cost is. The tradeoff is a larger working set,             but that might be worthwhile in some scenarios. &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>833</id><published>2003-06-28T05:11:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-06-28T05:11:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">I've only recently found out about NGEN, but I'm definitely loving it.

            &lt;span style=""&gt;I was doing some research online at work today, trying to optimize
            some of the security infrastructure I’ve been working on for my client. I ran
            across &lt;a href="http://world.std.com/~dtd/sign_encrypt/sign_encrypt7.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; in
            my search to remember whether, when both signing and encrypting a message, one is
            supposed to sign first or encrypt first. I knew that doing it one way was bad, but
            couldn’t remember which was which. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=""&gt;The article goes on at length about the many issues around signature
            and encryption, but I mostly want to point out the first part, where it talks about
            why you should always sign first, then encrypt second. &lt;/span&gt;

Jon - Not sure about this one - can you explain more?
* This makes it a huge PITA to move projects between machines, say in a team environment
Jon - moving between machines in a team environment isn't difficult if you just pay attention to the vdir issues, if you want to change the path - it is just in the .webinfo file.
* The vdir it creates for you is always in the wrong place, meaning I have to create it by hand beforehand
Jon - I know alot of people find this a pain in development - but IMO - having your vdirs under wwwroot makes the most sense for a) security reasons - you don't have to give the ASPNET/Network Service rights to addtional directories b) on a given server - having vdirs at random paths can be confusing for an admin or another dev c) having all vdirs in one physical directory makes admin things like backup easier
* When it asks me "open with FrontPage extensions or file share" I have no idea what's going on
Well - I always find this a lame reason - sorry Craig.  Kind of like saying "when I get a csharp compiler error I have no idea what is going on".  People should know the tool.  FrontPage extensions vs file share is a default (file share is the default).  Fileshare works best on a local machine or local network, FP works best over a longer connection - because it uses port 80 and http only, it can get around firewall issues etc.  Maybe you need a copy of Mastering Visual Studio .NET ;-)

I'm even glad to hear that all my complaints are groundless by virtue of being able to do the things I say I don't know how to do. 

However, the fact remains that quite a few people that I know hate web projects because they are counterintuitive. That suggests that there's something basically wrong with the way they're handled. 

And let's turn the argument around, anyway: can you give me one decent reason (one that I think is decent ;) ) why I *should* use web projects when I can just make a class library project? The only one I can think of is the deployment wizard, that copies the content files to a different web server, and that isn't sufficient to counter all the times I wind up having to try to figure out what VS.NET is doing with my web project. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="842"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>849</id><published>2003-07-07T03:51:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-07-07T03:51:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">Well - your complaints may or may not be groundless - that is what I am trying to figure out :)

Why use webprojects?  Well - first - you have to change the way VS.NET works to make all the designers work correctly with a class library project.  This is bad for me - since I teach courses and showing students how to use a standard tool in a non-standard way IMO is broken, since likely they will not be able to replicate when the get back to work, and likely will they WILL use webprojects.

The biggest complaint I hear about webprojects is that you need a virtual directory.  Well - you need a virtual directory just to make a web application work - this is an ASP.NET requirement - not a web project requirement.  So even if you use a class library project - you STILL have to go and configure the virtual directory (which was one of your complaints about webprojects - that you had to go create the vdir first - seems inconsistent since you have to do that ALL the time with a class library project).

Most of the people who say this are from our company - and generally our company has had a history of high standards when it comes to having rationales for the assertions we make.  In this area - I have found the rationales to be rather loose - "Well - it must be counterintuitive"  I just don't buy that - not that I think there isn't any way webproject might be broken  - lots of things in VS.NET are broken :)

I recommend webprojects because they take care of:
a) making a vdir
b) automatic debugging - setting a start page for debug
c) copying a webproject (including setting up the vdir on the remote machine - which is going to have to happen somehow)
d) no mess use of designers
e) remote server builds (web server doesn't have to be on my local machine)

There really isn't much to know about webproject - it isn't really complicated - in essence it is a class library project that builds locally and copies the assembly and any saved files to a webserver (could be local or remote).  It copies them either via FPSE or a file share (with file share being the default).  That is really it.

Here are my big issues. They may simply be that I don't understand the way that VS.NET works, but since I seem to get most things in VS.NET without too much trouble, I assert that that is simply proof that these are counterintuitive, and therefore annoying: 

1) Debugging seldom works right for me with F5. I have to Debug-&amp;gt;Processes-&amp;gt;Attach manually.
2) Absolute URLs seem to make their way into the project file, so when I move a web project to someone else's machine it won't open properly. 
3) The place it creates the vdir by default also complicates moving a solution that might consist of twelve or more projects - I can't just grab a directory hierarchy. Sure, I can create the vdir manually, but that negates one of the advantages. 
4) When I do try to open a project I've moved or goofed with in some way or breathed on wrong, I get dialog boxes "Open with file share" and "Open with Front Page extensions" that I don't understand. 

Again, all of these might well be fixable by removing my ignorance. But the experience has been a bad one, and the things you site (making a vdir, copying projects, etc.) are things I either already know how to do easily by hand, that I don't care about, or that don't usually work for me anyway. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="842"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>851</id><published>2003-07-07T08:50:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-07-07T08:50:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">1) No clue there

3) Yes - when you have a webproject as part of a bigger solution - creating the vdir first makes sense - you said you create them easily anyway - so why not for a webproject vs class library?  That's the one I don't understand the most when people say it - "I don't like to create the vdir manually" - but you *have* to for a class library project anyway - that perplexes me.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Just to chime in here, after finishing up a project of a couple of weeks, I tried to setup a new project on a local VS.NET/IIS install. I've setup my sites with FQDNs that point to individual IP addresses very similar to a production environment. Everything was working fine until I tried to create a new project at the root of a newly created web site. I keep getting the 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;"Unable to create open project &amp;lt;project name&amp;gt;. The file path &amp;lt;project path&amp;gt; does not correspond to the URL &amp;lt;project url&amp;gt;. The two need to map to the same server location."
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Well, they are mapped to the same place, but for what ever reason, VS.NET can't resolve. Also, when I try via IP address instead of a domain name, I get the same error, but once I press 'OK' to the path it gives me (which is the correct one), the project loads. But if I close the project, it's the same thing again, and again.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I know I've got a bit of a different setup than most, but conceptually it's all the same, 
&lt;br /&gt;project on file system = project on web server.
&lt;br /&gt;

Anyways, apparently VS.NET 2k2 creates a .tmp file &amp;amp; asks for it back, and that causes the problem with VS.NET 2k2, but I was using 2k3, which reminded me of the script mapping, I removed it and all worked well.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to post the solution for my particular problem incase anyone else has it!

Unfortunately, I’ve discovered that video performance             completely sucks under W2K3. For example, I haven’t been able to get Direct3D             hardware acceleration working at all on my laptop. This has been making it painful             to write &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig.DirectX/Direct3DTutorialIndex.html"&gt;my             Direct3D tutorial series&lt;/a&gt;, as I can get at best three frames per second. On top             of that, I want to do a little digital music work, and because Creative sucks when             it comes to drivers, none of the advanced features of my Live! Platinum 5.1 work under             Windows 2003, either. None of which was a problem with Windows XP on the same hardware.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             I downloaded the trial of VMWare, but it didn’t help – 3D performance             was still pitiful even running Windows XP, and the Creative XP drivers won’t             install on a virtual machine. “Oh well,” I thought, “Time to get             another computer – they’re cheap these days.” With the kind help             of &lt;a href="http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/"&gt;Brad Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to             figure out what I wanted. A little poking around on the ‘net, and pretty soon             I had found a winner:         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             INTEL, D865GBFL Motherboard Kit (Starts w/ INTEL P4 2.4 GHz)         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;              * INTEL, D865GBFL, Socket 478, Intel 865G, , DDR-400, HT, Lan.

            Martin Gudgin – a friend from his DM days and now a Microsoftie – has
            a good clarification of the SOAP Processing Model:

        &lt;div&gt;

                &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=";font-style:italic"&gt;The SOAP Processing Model continues to cause confusion
                amongst my friends, enemies, colleagues and associates. This may be in part to the
                somewhat vague nature of the description in &lt;a title="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SOAP-20000508/#_Toc478383491" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SOAP-20000508/#_Toc478383491"&gt;SOAP
                1.1&lt;/a&gt;. The description in &lt;a title="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-soap12-part1-20030624/#msgexchngmdl" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-soap12-part1-20030624/#msgexchngmdl"&gt;SOAP
                1.2&lt;/a&gt;, which has also been appropriated somewhat by the &lt;a title="http://www.ws-i.org/" href="http://www.ws-i.org/"&gt;WS-I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a title="http://www.ws-i.org/Profiles/Basic/2003-05/BasicProfile-1.0-WGAD.htm#SOAPMEM" href="http://www.ws-i.org/Profiles/Basic/2003-05/BasicProfile-1.0-WGAD.htm#SOAPMEM"&gt;Basic
                Profile 1.0&lt;/a&gt;, is more complete, yet confusion still reigns &lt;a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/mgudgin/default.aspx#nn2003-07-04T09:55:52Z"&gt;…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

I had remembered &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2003/02/15.aspx"&gt;the             other necessary part&lt;/a&gt; (which turns on acceleration at the OS level) but not the             part where you need to turn it on at the DirectX level. (The &lt;a href="http://www.ilopia.com/Windows2003/FAQ.aspx"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; they             pointed me to contains some other useful details, too.)         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             What’s funny is that I must have done this the last time I installed Windows             2003 – I just forgot half of the process.

We took a bunch             of video when we were in Hawaii getting married, and I’d like to play around             a bit with some editing. WMM is convenient because it ships with the OS.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             One of the problems I have, though, is that my camera (like all video cameras, I believe)             only downloads video via FireWire. And the only IEEE 1394 port in the house is on             my laptop, which runs Windows Server 2003, which doesn’t support WMM. After             a bit of poking around, I found &lt;a href="http://www.carr-engineering.com/dvio.htm"&gt;DVIO&lt;/a&gt;.             It lets me stream video out of my camera to my laptop, where I can save it off to             one of the machines where I can do some editing. It’s free and it seems to work.             About the only issue I’ve seen with it is that it crashes when I stop streaming,             but that doesn’t seem to affect the file.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             I’m a complete newbie when it comes to video, so if anyone has any advice, I’d             love it if you left a comment.         &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>859</id><published>2003-07-08T01:08:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-07-08T01:08:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">I just spent less than 20 pounds (about $30) on a generic PCI firewire card and it works perfectly.

What the guy from Alvio has totally failed to get is that the way the virus works is that it selects *pairs* of email addresses from the victim's address book.  It uses one as the "To:" address, but uses the other to form a spoofed "From:" address.  The fact that this was completely and obviously what happened, given that Craig used a one-time-email-address here is undeniable, but there's more.

Craig was kind enough to send me the original SMTP headers for this email.  They started:

Received: from 208.40.58.250 ([208.40.58.250]) for &amp;amp;lt;alvio@candera.sytes.net&amp;amp;gt; with MailEnable Catch-All Filter; Mon, 07 Jul 2003 12:39:47 -0400

To:  Subject: Re: Application 

As Igor says, the email appears to be from vendors@pricescan.com. However, note that it was delivered from a machine whose IP address is 208.40.58.250.

If we look up Alvio's MX records in DNS, we find this:

alvio.com       MX preference = 0, mail exchanger = mail.alvio.com
mail.alvio.com  internet address = 208.40.58.250

Lo and behold, if the email wasn't sent from Alvio's mail server...

So Igor's looking pretty foolish right now.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="864"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>866</id><published>2003-07-11T18:39:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-07-11T18:39:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">Schneier had an interesting take (from the other side) of unique email addresses and spammers.

As amused as I was to have a complete stranger asking me to send them a headshot,             I was curious to see what she’d written. My referrer log told the tale today.             The article is &lt;a href="http://www.sdmagazine.com/documents/s=7816/sdmdev0307/#4"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

        &lt;p&gt;
            I like to work at the command line. Indeed, for some of the work I’m doing right
            now, I have to, since our build process is command-line driven. But I have a particular
            directory structure that I like to use to put all my files that need backing up in
            one place. Unfortunately, that means that from the command line I’d have to
            work with paths like this:
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=";font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;C:\data\work\consulting\28 – FooCustomer\sources\build&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Which is a pain to type.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I’ve been using the subst command for a long time to address the problem. It
            lets you create a drive letter that actually maps to a particular location on your
            hard drive. So if I do this
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=";font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;Subst S: "C:\data\work\consulting\28 –
            FooCustomer\sources\build"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I can now simply work from the S drive and I’ll be in my build directory. This
            has been very handy for some long-distance music collaboration that I’ve been
            doing, too, since the digital music program I use (Cakewalk) likes to embed absolute
            paths in the files it saves. If my partner and I both map some drive to the directory
            that we like to use, we can fool Cakewalk into working, making it easy for us to share
            files.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The problem with this approach is that it doesn’t work for anyone other than
            the currently logged in user. This wasn’t a problem until recently, when I wanted
            to run some automated setup as part of the build process. Because that setup does
            things like set up a database, and because the database is a service that runs non-interactively,
            it means that I had to go back to using the actual path off the C drive in my config
            files. Being a programmer, this horrible lack of symmetry – using the S drive
            in the build script &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for the bits
            that deal with the database – really grated on me. Not to mention that using
            two different paths depending on what piece I was dealing with confused both me and
            my source control program.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            That’s when I went searching for one of my favorite tools: linkd. Linkd lets
            you create symbolic links in your filesystem, just like under Unix. A symbolic link
            is a directory that actually redirects you to somewhere else on the harddrive. So
            by running
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=";font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;Linkd \etc\build "C:\data\work\consulting\28
            – FooCustomer\sources\build"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I now have a directory on my C drive called \etc\build that’s actually a reference
            off to some other directory. Any changes I make in one place are reflected in the
            other – and unlike .lnk files, it works at the file system level, meaning it’ll
            work from the command line, and is visible to all sessions on the machine, not just
            the ones in the current session. It quite literally just gives two names to the same
            directory.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I could have chosen to use it the other way, too. Rather than creating a link to a
            directory within the one directory that I back up, I could have used it to build up
            my backup directory by creating links off to all the places that contain data I want
            to back up.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I was able to find linkd and many other great tools &lt;a href="http://www.petri.co.il/download_free_reskit_tools.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;   No, they are not hard links. "rmdir /Q /S directory", for example, will not delete the targets of junctions it finds below "directory".  (I am not sure what it would do if "directory" were a junction, but that is another matter...)   Explorer (and "del /s") will delete the contents of the target because Explorer walks the directory tree when doing it's delete, and it does not check if a "directory" entry is a junction before it performs this walk.  You must be carefule with any application which walks the directory tree deleting things without checking if a directory is a symbolic link (even in Unix).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;rolf:
&lt;br /&gt;   "shortcuts" will definitely not fulfill that purpose.  "shortcuts" are implimented at the application level: that is, the application must be aware of shortcuts, watch for them, and process them correctly.  Most applications do not do this.  junctions, as with unix links, are implemented at the OS/file system level, so applications can be blissfully unaware of their existence (though you must be careful with applications which delete directory trees, as explained above).</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="870"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>51205</id><published>2008-06-25T05:36:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-06-25T05:36:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: LinkD</title><content type="html">Need this tool to fix my SYSVOL directory on one of my DC's</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="870"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>874</id><published>2003-07-15T05:20:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-07-15T05:20:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Windows.h</title><content type="html">     &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             I came across &lt;a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/UserSamples/Details.aspx?SampleGuid=f1dd70e4-c212-4a6f-bff7-c82e34c8836f"&gt;this             link&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://discuss.develop.com/dotnet-clr.html"&gt;the DOTNET-CLR mailing             list&lt;/a&gt; today.

What about the 95% of people who aren't doing MC++? Maybe I'm missing something

You mean those spending 2 days blindly trying to figure out a P/Invoke param signature instead of just installing MC++ and writing the call?
Come on, shops not using MC++ while doing a lot of native calls are simply unsmart, and losing money.

That's the fault of Microsoft to have promoted P/Invoke more than MC++. I believe they have been doing a lousy job here, and I hope they change ASAP.


&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Also, I don't think it's accurate to say that no marshalling is occurring. If you have a managed string

Yes and No.

There has to be a way to translate a managed string to unmanaged somehow, that's true, but that's something you do once for an entire MC++ library method. And then the method can do 100 native function calls because all it has to do is call unmanaged code with unmanaged parameters. Then at the end, you are expected to translate the unmanaged string back to managed.

The good news is that once you have done such translation once and for a few types (string, general struct), then you end up using it all the time. In fact, you are doing custom marshaling with simple CTS types. There's no issue here. Translating a string from managed to unmanaged is just one standard line of code. Many samples in many places about this.

Also, please note you do some of that  trivial marshaling at the begin and at the end only, and you are not doing any marshaling in between. That's my point. The consequences on performance is obvious.

In short, if you are willing to use this library of preinteroped functions, please make sure you know how to premarshal unsafe pointers.

So perhaps what we both agree on is that interop is difficult, and you have to understand what's going on. Whether you use MC++ or not. 

As far as the argument around performance, I can buy what you're saying for chatty transitions across the managed boundary, but it doesn't hold for what I think is the more common case, where I do most of my work in managed space, and once in a while have to call over to Win32 for something. In that case, the productivity benefits of working in C# (it's just easier than MC++) are going to be a major deciding factor for most projects.

I thought .NET was about interoperable languages. I write a library with MC++ where I have all the platform specific logic.
Then I have UI, managers, and so on done in C#, VB.NET or whatever I might like. I only need to reference the MC++ library. Doing so, the languages are used for what they provide best. Yes, writing apps bottom-up using C# is faster than with C++ (MFC or the like).

It's certainly true that you see teams made up of a bunch of junior developers and one senior guy who handles the low level muck, in which case it might be feasible to take this approach.

Tell this to the Quake II .NET guy. :-)
How could he recompile the whole quake engine in a matter of days if MC++ was THAT cumbersome?

MC++ is hard for (syntaxically IMHO) for VB programmers. But please tell me what is easy for VB programmers other than drag&amp;amp;dropping components without being seen. :-)

I like the idea that "low-level" application logic requires senior people . What we'll be regarded (C++) as assembly language in just ten years ahead. This is kinda relief for us people in our 30s. You sure understand my point.

He was             using my &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig/HowToSymmetricallyEncryptAString.html"&gt;How             to Encrypt a String sample&lt;/a&gt;, so he asked me if I could take a look at it.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             The symptoms were strange. He built an app that was almost exactly like the one in             my sample. One of the few differences was that he was using the 3DES algorithm instead             of the Rijndael algorithm. But he discovered that if he hit the “Encrypt”             button a bunch of times, that after a few times, the encrypted output would change             to something else. I would have expected that if he were using an asymmetric algorithm             like RSA, since random padding is added to the data in that case, but for 3DES it             should encrypt to the same thing every time. The really weird part was that it was             only exhibiting this behavior on one machine.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             The first thing I asked him was what he was using for an Initialization Vector (IV).             The IV is important because symmetric algorithms are often implemented using a sort             of feedback loop: they encrypt a block, then use the output of that encryption to             parameterize the encryption of the next block. If you do this, you need something             to feed into the encryption of the &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; block:             that’s the IV. If he was somehow changing the IV, that would change the encryption             of the first block and thus the entire output. Rich said he wasn’t mucking with             the IV at all: he was initializing it once at process startup and storing it in a             static variable. Then he’d hand a reference to that array into each call to             create the encryptor or decryptor object.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             Well, Rich is no dummy. Following up on my suggestion around the IV as the culprit,             and combining it with his own insight that this sort of intermittent error could be             caused by something getting finalized after a garbage collection cycle, he put in             some code to force a GC. Sure enough, as soon as a GC was forced, the encryption changed.             From this, he was able to figure out what was going on.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             It turns out that there’s a bug in the 1.0 implementation of the wrapper classes             that &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;System.Security.Cryptography&lt;/span&gt; uses             to give you access to the Crypto API in Windows. When you call &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;CreateEncryptor&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;CreateDecryptor&lt;/span&gt;,             the object that comes back implements &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;IDisposable&lt;/span&gt;.             The object that they’re using zeros out the IV in &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;Dispose&lt;/span&gt;.             This wouldn’t be so bad, but the problem is that it isn’t making a copy             of the IV during creation – it’s making a copy of a &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;reference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; to             the IV. So during finalization of the object, the buggy code will actually zero out             an array that someone else owns. Bad.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             Clearly, Microsoft is aware of this problem, because it’s fixed in the 1.1 framework.             This is why Rich only saw it on one of his computers. And it’s not a problem             if you’re using &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;RijndaelManaged&lt;/span&gt; –             only if you use the DES, 3DES, or RC2 implementations in the libraries. But be aware             of it – if you think you might run code on the 1.0 version of the framework,             be sure to use &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;Array.Copy&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;Clone&lt;/span&gt; to             hand the crypto libraries something they can safely zero out without screwing up your             code.         &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>885</id><published>2003-07-18T05:51:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-07-18T05:51:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Social Software, Groups, and Collective Minds</title><content type="html">

            Franci Penov (whose homepage I don’t know) posted &lt;a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html"&gt;this
            link&lt;/a&gt; over on the &lt;a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/"&gt;win_tech_off_topic&lt;/a&gt; mailing
            list. It’s an absolutely fascinating speech given by Clay Shirky earlier this
            year about the effects of people on software and vice versa. Since I’m willing
            to bet that just about everyone reading this is involved somehow in connecting humans
            to computers or vice versa, I feel comfortable predicting you will find this relevant.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The piece is entitled “A Group Is It’s Own Worst Enemy”, and I think
            the central lesson of the paper can be summed up this way, “Your users will
            do things their way, individually and collectively. Deal with it.” There’s
            some great bits. Here’s one of my favorites:
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in"&gt;
            &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=";font-style:italic"&gt;The Calvinists had a doctrine of natural grace
            and supernatural grace. Natural grace was "You have to do all the right things in
            the world to get to heaven..." and supernatural grace was "...and God has to anoint
            you." And you never knew if you had supernatural grace or not. This was their way
            of getting around the fact that the Book of Revelations put an upper limit on the
            number of people who were going to heaven.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in"&gt;
            &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=";font-style:italic"&gt;Social software is like that. You can find the
            same piece of code running in many, many environments. And sometimes it works and
            sometimes it doesn't. So there is something supernatural about groups being a run-time
            experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
             
        &lt;/p&gt;

            I’m constantly hearing from people, “Why would Microsoft &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; that?”
            Or sometimes it takes the form of, “Why &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;didn’t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Microsoft
            do that?” Almost invariably, this is because people are examining the situation
            from the narrow perspective of their own problem domain. “Hey, I need something
            that knows how to connect to any database and hide all the differences, and I’ve
            figured out how to do it for my problem domain where I control all the variables.
            So Microsoft should be able to do it for everyone.”
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Well, the lessons of the last two decades have shown us that solving a problem generally
            is much, much harder than solving it for one specific case. Or, to put it another
            way, things are almost never as straightforward as they first appear. Along those
            lines, &lt;a href="http://www.ingorammer.com/"&gt;Ingo&lt;/a&gt; has posted an &lt;a href="http://www.ingorammer.com/Articles/SealedIsGood.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; that

The biggest issue is generally that your class can now be used anywhere the base class is expected. So if Microsoft has code written against the base, and you hurl your own class in there, it could break things. So it may not so much be them protecting you from yourself as them protecting themselves from you. 

Inheritance hierarchies where the various pieces are written by different developers are super scary. We talk about encapsulation in OO as a good thing - well inheritance busts that into tiny pieces because you're modifying the way the base class behaves, and it's modifying the way you behave. 

Does this mean it doesn't suck for you? Of course not - it clearly sucks for you. I'm just pointing out that many people underestimate the dirtyness of what often looks like a clean abstraction, or the complexity of what looks like a simple problem. How many times have you started down a path only to hit a wall. "Damn! I didn't think of that" is probably the one phrase I've said more than any other in my career.

It's just that Microsoft isn't going to be hurt if I screw up a derived class - they're not selling my software, I am. If an app using one of my handy-dandy, new-and-improved ImageListEx classes dies horribly, taking the OS, hard drive, and the goldfish in the tank next door with it, it's will be blamed on the app that was running when everything went wonky, not the .NET Framework. As it should be - it will have been due to me being a big dumb-head.
I guess what I'm saying is: test it in the scenarios you can think of (or find the use cases are willing to stand by), draw a line, and say "There you go. We'll cover you up to this point. If you cross this line, you're on your own."
Incidentally, I actually can think of one or two scenarios where sealed makes sense. I can see a use for sealing security-related classes, for instance.

Which costs money, pain, and time.

That the users come to them first? 

Even if it's not true, they're certainly going to see things that way because they don't see the cases where people don't talk to them. 

I was thinking about your comments last night (*cough* I'm a nerd *cough*), and I harkened back to MFC. I was never a huge MFC programmer, but I remember that MFC shipped in source form. I have to think one of the reasons for this is that it just got to be too hard to design for black-box extension of a UI framework while maintaining efficiency. This is consistent with the law of leaky abstractions that I'm sure you've read. Certainly, it's consistent with my experiences around the shortcomings of OO as a reuse mechanism, *especially* wrt inheritance. 

Bottom line for me: designing a reusable class library is super hard. It's much easier with sealed, since it cuts out 90% of the weird cases that can screw you. Therefore sealed is a good thing to be *able* to use.

It seems a bit odd that I've never been here, having made a living focusing on their technologies for the last eight years. Anyway, I'm excited about the trip for two reasons. 

First, I think it'll be fun to check the place out. There are a number of people working here that I haven't seen in a while, and I'm hoping to catch up with them. 

Secondly, when this week is over, so is my contract. I've been renewed for another month, but because the project is going to be in a planning stage for a few weeks, and because I'm going to Taiwan in early September, that month doesn't start until about seven weeks from now. That means that for all of August, I'm only going to be working about two days a week. The rest of the time I'm going to devote to catching up on a number of things that have been slipping through the cracks in my life, like finishing the basement, sending thank-yous for our wedding gifts, and generally decompressing. 

I'm sure that a month won't seem like enough by the time it's over, but it beats a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>898</id><published>2003-08-01T08:47:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-08-01T08:47:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">I made a difference</title><content type="html">

    &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            There’s something I ran into recently that even experienced programmers can
            get wrong. We were adding error handling to something, and I saw this in the code:
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            catch (Exception e)&lt;br /&gt;
            {&lt;br /&gt;
                LogError(e);&lt;br /&gt;
                throw e;&lt;br /&gt;
            }
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The idea being that we log all errors in our components, but then throw them again
            to let the higher level systems actually figure out what to do. This works well. The
            problem comes in with the throw – it actually works much better to do this:
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            catch (Exception e)&lt;br /&gt;
            {&lt;br /&gt;
                LogError(e);&lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;    throw;   &lt;/b&gt;// Rethrows the exception we just caught&lt;b&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;/b&gt;}
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Notice the absence of an argument to the throw statement in the second variation.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The difference between these two variations is subtle but important. The second variation
            is the only one that actually &lt;i&gt;re-throws&lt;/i&gt; the original exception. Meaning that
            the exact same information is passed along up the stack. With the first variation,
            the higher level caller isn’t going to get all the information about the original
            error. For example, the call stack in the exception is replaced with a new call stack
            that originates at the “throw e” statement – which is not what we
            want to record.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

catch(Exception ex)
{
    throw(new Exception("my additional error context here, maybe some local variable values etc.",ex));
}

Here, we have put the original exception as the inner exception of the newly created exception.  Then, at the point where we are "really" going to deal with the exception, you do all your logging in one spot (walking down through the inner exceptions.)  Then you get one log entry for the original exception, rather than entries at every point you happen to catch.  You still have all of the stack traces availble to you, albeit split among the exceptions.  

Of course, this is only workable if you are comfortable changing the type of the exception.  (I used System.Exception above when creating a new one, but you could use any type you like.)  But you often are willing to change the type - you might want to turn a low-level exception into something more relevant to the API you are exposing, etc.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="900"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>908</id><published>2003-08-08T03:24:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-08-08T03:24:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">I think that's a great approach.

Please tell me if there is a better way of doing this, but we prefer to log all Exceptions in EventHandlers so that we don't end up with code resuming after an exception is handled, we know the "real-world" source of the error (all errors are the User's fault, right? ~wink~), etc. 

I've been wrestling with TargetSite.ReflectedType and other properties just to get the name of the EventHandler that does the final catch into our log, but Craig's insight into the shortened StrackTrace just may be the ticket.  Here is what I'm after:

You want the name of the method that's doing the catch? But you want to figure it out inside the call to your Debug method? Why not just pass the method name in? Otherwise, if you pass in the exception, you should be able to do something like this: 

private void SayCatchMethodName(Exception ex) {
  Console.WriteLine(ex.StackTrace.GetFrame(0).GetMethod.Name); 
}

Does that do what you want? It pulls the topmost stack frame off the stack trace and prints the name of the method it corresponds to. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="900"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>911</id><published>2003-08-15T05:37:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-08-15T05:37:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">Ah.

This trivial, as you can use the MethodInfo.GetCurrentMethod().Name to find out the currently executing method name, making it easy to cut and paste your code around.

If you aren't catching a specific exception type, (e.g. SqlException), you don't know WHAT the problem is.  How can you expect to handle it?  Worse, you can ignore it.  There are some exceptions that you just cannot handle gracefully, such as an OutOfMemoryException.  Think very hard before you catch and ignore a general Exception.  You will pay for it when it comes time to debug because you wont know that there was a problem until your code stops working and you are forced to look at your log files.

I have a question, have you ever encountered a case in which you have a specific catch block followed by an Exception catch block, when you rethrow the exeption you just recieved in the specific catch block the Exception catch block can't catch the exception, or example like this code:

public class Excp{
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{
     String s ="abc";
   int k= 0; int j;
try {

if (k == 0) j = 10/k;
    } 
	 catch (ArithmeticException ex) {
System.out.println("arithmetic error");
      throw ex;
    } 
	 catch (Exception e) {
System.out.println("Error");
    } finally {
System.out.println("in finally clause");
    }
System.out.println("after try block");
System.out.println(s);
}}

"error" message in Exception catch block doesn't print! it really surprised me...

So the throw continues outside the context of the try/catch/finally block. You'd need to use nested try statements to do what you're trying to do here. 

Also, your code looks to be a weird mix of Java and C#.

You see, it was giving me Intellisense             in the XML editor, letting me know what elements and attributes were legal to appear             as children of whatever element I was inside. Very cool.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             I thought maybe it was going to the namespace URI and downloading the schema, but             opening a browser and pointing it to the URL in question yielded nothing, so that             couldn’t be it. After a bit of poking, I discovered that what it was doing was             looking in a particular directory for schemas. On my machine, that directory is C:\Program             Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Common7\Packages\schemas\xml.

    &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I’m a keyboard kind of guy. I hate it when I have to put my hands on the mouse – it
            slows me way down. So it should be no surprise that I’m a fan of emacs – keystrokes
            for everything. Still, I tend to use VS.NET, because it’s got a bunch of stuff that
            I can’t get (yet) in emacs, like Intellisense and integrated debugging. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            As a result, I’ve made an effort to learn VS.NET shortcut keys. I find myself often
            pointing these out to fellow developers, especially when I’m suffering, watching them
            laboriously navigate the menu system or type with one hand. Here are my favorites.
            Some of these have already made the blogging rounds, but hopefully you’ll find at
            least one gem in here 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="BORDER-RIGHT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-COLLAPSE: collapse" class="MsoTableGrid"&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;
                            Key sequence 
                        &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/td&gt;

                            Works like your browser’s “back” button – takes you to the last line of code you were

                            Adds or removes a bookmark to the current line. I use this one frequently when adding
                            a using statement to the current file. Set a bookmark so I don’t lose my place, go
                            to the top of the file (ctrl-home), add the using statement, then jump back to the
                            bookmark. 
                        &lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;
                            Go to next bookmark 
                        &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/td&gt;
                    &lt;td valign="top" style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5.4pt; BORDER-TOP: medium none; PADDING-LEFT: 5.4pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0in; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; PADDING-TOP: 0in; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid"&gt;

                            Navigates to the next bookmark. Because this gets annoying when there are lots of
                            bookmarks in the file, I generally toggle the bookmark off as soon as I get back to
                            it. 
                        &lt;/p&gt;

                            Incremental search 
                        &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/td&gt;
                    &lt;td valign="top" style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5.4pt; BORDER-TOP: medium none; PADDING-LEFT: 5.4pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0in; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; PADDING-TOP: 0in; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid"&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;
                            Incremental search is a great way to search really quickly: you type ctrl-i and then
                            immediately start typing the word you’re looking for. As you type each letter, VS.NET
                            will find the first instance of what you’ve typed so far. So, for example, if you’re
                            looking for “foo”, you type ctrl-i, then “f”, and it will find the first instance
                            of “f”. Then you type “o” and it will find the first instance of “fo”. If that’s “foo”,
                            you’re done. If it’s “for” you can either type “o” again to look for “foo” or type
                            ctrl-i again to look for the next instance of  “fo”. Emacs has had this forever,
                            but it’s nice to have it in VS.NET, too. 
                        &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;
                &lt;tr&gt;
                    &lt;td valign="top" style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5.4pt; BORDER-TOP: medium none; PADDING-LEFT: 5.4pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0in; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-TOP: 0in; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid"&gt;

                            VS.NET often insists on showing me the stupid designer view when what I want to see
                            is the code. F7 shows me the code. 
                        &lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;td valign="top" style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5.4pt; BORDER-TOP: medium none; PADDING-LEFT: 5.4pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0in; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; PADDING-TOP: 0in; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid"&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;
                            Sometimes I actually &lt;b&gt;do&lt;/b&gt; want to see the designer. This will show it to me when
                            I’m in the corresponding code file. 
                        &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;/tbody&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Those are the main ones that I use day-to-day. There are many, many more – I find
            it really useful to browse through the Tools-&amp;gt;Customize-&amp;gt;Keyboard dialog every
            once in a while, looking for good ones (the keyboard shortcuts show up in “Shortcut(s)
            for selected command”). 
        &lt;/p&gt;

Personally, I can't say I care for the outlining stuff too much. It's just personal opinion, but popping the damn things open and closed is more trouble than just doing an incremental search for the name. What they really need is a keystroke that will navigate me to a method by name - sort of like a scoped incremental search. 

Anyway - thanks for the suggestion, I know a lot of people use outlining. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="922"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>925</id><published>2003-08-12T18:36:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-08-12T18:36:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">Ctrl-Shift-Enter.

    &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
            As you may know, I'm a consultant. Right now, my main clients are Microsoft (you've
            probably heard of them) and Integic (you might not have heard of them). Both of them
            have some pretty interesting projects going on. I'd like to talk a bit about the one
            at Microsoft.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
             
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
            I mentioned previously that I'm doing work for MSDN but that I wasn't allowed to talk
            about it. Well, I've gotten clearance to mention a few things, so I'm here to share.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
             
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
            The project I'm involved in has already been mentioned a few times - both &lt;a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/tewald/default.aspx"&gt;Tim
            Ewald&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/saraw/PermaLink.aspx/bb6161af-ec92-441d-9c4a-764fa4e8634e"&gt;Sara
            Williams&lt;/a&gt; have talked about it in their blogs. The basic idea behind what we're
            doing is to rebuild the parts of MSDN that need building, starting - where necessary
            - from the ground up.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
             
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
            This is exciting for several reasons:
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
             
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
            1) Tim has an all-XML vision for the system that is going to enable MSDN to provide
            some interesting services to developers.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
            2) The team has some serious technical talent, and a few of them are old friends of
            mine.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
            3) msdn.microsoft.com is obviously a gigantic, large-scale website, and I've always
            been interested in the far end of that particular spectrum.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
            4) I've never worked on a Microsoft project before this.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
             
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
            The part we're tackling now involves developing a system for the people that produce
            and manage content at MSDN to more easily and quickly get that content out to the
            public. And for the public to more easily, reliably, and flexibly access that information. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
             
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
            I don't want to go into all the details of the system today - some things we're still
            figuring out, some things will change, and some things might get dropped - but I have
            permission to say more in future posts. And I will.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
             
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;
             
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

I have one question and it's a good opportunity to ask it. When there is no sample.wav in program directory, we get FileNotFoundException in JIT debugging dialog (BTW, it would be nice to see file name not found).

OK, we can add catch section to program. But what if DirectX 9 not installed on user machine? How can we catch Microsoft.DirectX.Direct3D.dll FileNotFoundException?

On your second point, it's a good question, and far more general than just DirectX. Basically, you need to understand when and how assemblies get loaded, and what to do if they fail. I'll do a little research to make sure what's in my head is right and blog something on it in the next few days. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="930"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>933</id><published>2003-08-18T15:19:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-08-18T15:19:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">OK, I wrote it up.

It’s a great question, because – as more and more people work             with Managed DirectX – applications are going to have to be prepared to run             on machines that may have older versions of DirectX installed. Since Managed DirectX             is new with DirectX 9.0 – and since it’s possible to install even DirectX             9 without the managed pieces – the absence of, say, Microsoft.DirectX.Direct3D.dll             is a real possibility.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             And this isn’t just a problem for DirectX assemblies. In general, it should             be possible for applications to gracefully degrade when faced with a missing component.             There are many definitions of “graceful degradation” – whether that’s             throwing up a dialog box, emailing tech support automatically or downloading and installing             the missing pieces depends on the application. But regardless, you have to know how             to recover when your application tries to load an assembly and fails.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             Anyway, as I was writing up this entry, it got a bit longer than I thought it would.

            We all know what the solution to hardware problems are: a swift - literal - boot.
            So when my Dell Inspiron 8100 refused to let me type the letter ‘a’ any
            more, I simply took the damn keyboard apart and put it back on. Working great now.
            Of course, the speakers don’t seem to work any more, but that’s a trade
            I’ll make any day of the week.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            This is just the sort of thing one wants to happen before one takes one’s computer
            overseas for a couple of weeks. The cool thing is, I found &lt;a href="http://docs.us.dell.com/docs/systems/ins8100/remove.htm"&gt;some
            instructions&lt;/a&gt; on Dell’s website on how to take the keyboard off. There’s
            some other maintenance stuff there, too. Which is handy now that I’ve completely
            voided the warranty. :p
        &lt;/p&gt;

We use             the Enterprise Instrumentation Framework to do this (oddly only available via MSDN             Subscriber download at the Universal level). When I got into the ASP.NET web pages             I’d written, I had a bit of a problem. I didn’t really want to add try/catch             blocks around every single method in the page’s base class – that would             be a little redundant, and would mean that I’d have to change code in a bunch             of places if I decided to change the style of errors I was reporting.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             This is where it pays to be friends with &lt;a href="http://staff.develop.com/onion/"&gt;Fritz             Onion&lt;/a&gt;. :) I pinged him, and he suggested a clever little hack (in the good sense             of that word) to put all my error handling code in one place.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             The trick is to re-implement IHttpHandler on the page class itself. Since IHttpHandler::ProcessRequest             is the one entry point for all requests into the page – whether that’s             a callback handler for an event from the client or the initial Page_Load call –             I could simply delegate back to the Page class’s ProcessRequest, but catch any             errors that came out of it. One place to put all my high-level error handling. And             I could even &lt;a href="http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog2/PermaLink.aspx/db0d7152-e6a9-4b0f-8306-937abcbe561f"&gt;rethrow             the exception&lt;/a&gt; if I wanted to still use ASP.NET’s built-in error handling.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             It goes something like this:         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;using System;&lt;br /&gt;             using System.Web;&lt;br /&gt;             using System.Web.UI;&lt;br /&gt;             using System.Web.UI.WebControls;&lt;br /&gt;             &lt;br /&gt;             public class Default : Page, IHttpHandler&lt;br /&gt;             {&lt;br /&gt;               public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext ctx)&lt;br /&gt;               {&lt;br /&gt;                 try {&lt;br /&gt;                   // Let the Page class itself handle the processing,             as usual&lt;br /&gt;                   base.ProcessRequest(ctx);&lt;br /&gt;                 }&lt;br /&gt;                 catch (Exception e) {&lt;br /&gt;                   // Log it here – event log, EIF, whatever&lt;br /&gt;             &lt;br /&gt;                   // Use our own error page or simply re-throw&lt;br /&gt;                   ctx.Response.Redirect("myerror.aspx");&lt;br /&gt;                 }&lt;br /&gt;               }&lt;br /&gt;             &lt;br /&gt;               public void Page_Load(object o, EventArgs e)&lt;br /&gt;               {&lt;br /&gt;                 throw new ApplicationException("Whoops");&lt;br /&gt;               }&lt;br /&gt;             &lt;br /&gt;               public void Button_OnClick(object o, EventArgs e)&lt;br /&gt;               {&lt;br /&gt;                 throw new ApplicationException("Aiieeeee!!!");&lt;br /&gt;               }&lt;br /&gt;             }&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>13</thr:total></entry><entry><id>942</id><published>2003-08-21T03:20:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-08-21T03:20:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">Cool hack, definitely.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="941"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>943</id><published>2003-08-21T04:37:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-08-21T04:37:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">It would be like a sort of "debug" version of RenderChildren method, just to catch exceptions throwed by Web Components without stopping the page rendering.

If you catch errors at this level, it's already too late to do anything other than log and possibly redirect. You don't know what stage the pipeline is at, so for all you know the controls haven't even been created yet. And it's even more likely that their Render method will never be called, as that happens fairly late in the game. 

So I don't see how you'd be able to actually affect the output of the page, other than to send the user somewhere else.

I thought that if you continue to process all web components in a page, you could see some part of the page missing, but you could render other Web Components on the page, and of course catch (and log) more errors in different part of the page.
The problem borns when, in a developing page, I've seen an error in a Web Component that was at the beginning. That Web Component was not under my control (imagine it stopped work due to an error, and that it was checked out by someone else) and I couldn't test another Web Component that was not related to the first one but, unfortunately, was in the same page.
So, only for debug purposes, it would be an useful feature... or am I missing something dangerous?</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="941"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>949</id><published>2003-08-22T00:04:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-08-22T00:04:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">I can't think of anything dangerous, but I'm not sure you'd generally see something that would look like you describe. After all, there are a whole bunch of steps that happen before rendering, so if something went wrong somewhere in one of those, you presumably wouldn't see anything from any of the controls, rather than just seeing the ones that didn't barf. 

Of course, a file being checked out by someone else shouldn't stop you editing it. That's a limitation of the default configuration of SourceSafe, and most other systems don't work like that. Also, "Get Latest, Make Writable" is a reasonable solution when things like that come up. ;) </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="941"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>950</id><published>2003-08-25T04:04:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-08-25T04:04:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">Works great, seems to cast a wider net than using httpapplication's onerror from my quick tests.

One thing that's odd is if you enable customErrors in web.config and then use Server.Transfer you'll be catching ThreadAbort every time. What's wierd to me here is that this doesn't happen if customErrors are off.

So I modified my version to just catch ThreadAbort first in ProcessRequest and do nothing. Which doesn't seem right, but it won't work otherwise.

&lt;br /&gt;It will be reusable in any asp.net project and in some case we might need to implement our own IHttpHandler to bypass default asp.net handlers, In those cases IHttpModule is still valid, Because as per my knowledge at a time only one IHttpHandler can be assign to particular request.

This event is             issued whenever an unhandled exception occurs. The exception that has been thrown             is available via Server.GetLastError(). The easiest way to do this is by making a             new class that overrides IHttpModule and registering it in Web.config, like so:&lt;/i&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in" class="MsoNormal"&gt;             &lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/archives/003785.shtml"&gt;The .NET             Guy&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             I like this a lot, and I think both techniques are valuable tools to have in your             error handling arsenal – the way Fritz showed me gives you the ability to do             per-page error handling, and Brad’s approach gives you application-level error             handling. I plan to use both, especially since Brad’s way lets me catch more             types of errors.

            So, I've recently made a conscious decision to &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; install Visual Studio.NET
            on my new machine. I'm running &lt;a href="http://www.cygwin.com/"&gt;Cygwin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/directory/text/editors/emacs.html"&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt;,
            building with &lt;a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net/"&gt;NAnt&lt;/a&gt;, and doing source control
            with &lt;a href="http://www.cvshome.org/"&gt;CVS&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, I want to see how far I
            can take it. Right now, I'm loving it, despite the fact that I've already found a
            few bugs.
        &lt;/p&gt;

            The thing is, I know eventually, when there's a new version of Visual Studio.NET,
            or the version after that, or the version after that, I'll love that just as much.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            It's a pattern I've seen in myself over and over again, and which I've observed particularly
            in bright, technical people: “new” is way more interesting than “current”
            or “old” . The phases go something like this:
        &lt;/p&gt;

            I'm using right now sucks! This bug and that bug are killing me.
        &lt;/p&gt;

            2)&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt; Hey,
            here are about twelve other things that do something similar.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;
            3)&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt; Wow,
            these eleven suck even worse.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;
            4)&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt; Hey,
            this one is pretty cool…
        &lt;/p&gt;

            5)&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt; Wow!
            This feature is awesome! How could I live without it?! (repeat several times).
        &lt;/p&gt;

            6)&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt; Period
            of quiet contentment.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;
            7)&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt; D'oh!
            First major/minor bug!
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;
            8)&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt; OK,
            I'm used to working around that.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;
            9)&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt; D'oh!
            Another major/minor bug! (repeat serveral times).
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;
            10)&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Eventually, goto 1. :)
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            In other words:
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;
            &lt;span style="font-family:Symbol"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Features
            that work escape our notice after we're used to them
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;
            &lt;span style="font-family:Symbol"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Bugs
            jump right out at us
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;
            &lt;span style="font-family:Symbol"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Even
            subtle bugs jump out after continued usage
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;
            &lt;span style="font-family:Symbol"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Therefore,
            over time, most software becomes annoying
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Also note:
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;
            &lt;span style="font-family:Symbol"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Most
            software sucks so bad it doesn't even make it into the above loop.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I don't expect that my move to a more Unix-like environment will ultimately prove
            to be better &lt;b&gt;overall&lt;/b&gt; than my MSFT-only existence has. However, changing the
            set of issues I run into is what keeps my brain engaged.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Tim Ewald is one of the people at DM who has changed the way I think about software.
            In fact, he has a tendency to do so just about every time I talk to him. So it’s
            great to be working with him at MSDN.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            One of the things that Tim has really taken to heart is what he (and others) call
            “the XML lifestyle”. Among other things, Tim has been evangelizing an
            aspect of this viewpoint that is definitely against the mainstream thought, that XML
            is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; primarily – or even generally – a serialization format for
            objects. Just as he did for transactional systems back in the COM+/MTS days, Tim is
            pointing out that OO viewpoints have a serious impedance mismatch with the properties
            of the systems we actually need to build.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            To that end, Tim has relaunched &lt;a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/tewald/default.aspx"&gt;his
            blog&lt;/a&gt; (RSS &lt;a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/tewald/blogxbrowsing.asmx/GetRss?"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)
            and named it “XML Eye for the Object Guy”, a very intentional take on
            the popular TV show of similar name. Just like the show, Tim will be providing advice
            and insight based on his minority tendencies to the masses. His goal is to get us
            all dressing a bit more XML, and a bit less Object. Subscribed!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

            been up to over at MSDN, this is it: we’re implementing Tim’s vision.
            It’s been a blast, and has fundamentally changed the way I think about XML-based
            systems.

            XSLT to implement logic declaratively. He concludes with a look at our next steps,
            including more generic plumbing and exposing XML content through RSS and Web services.&lt;br /&gt;

            I live near Washington DC, so we were right in the path of the hurricane that came
            through last night. I wound up staying home from work on Thursday because I had to
            help my wife make a few preparations (trimming branches that were close to windows,
            for example) and I didn’t wind to get caught out at work if things got nasty.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Fortunately for us, things didn’t get nasty at our house. The power bounced
            for a few seconds four or five times, but that was about it. I even felt comfortable
            driving out later in the evening to return some movies to the video store. Along the
            way, I saw a lot of lights out and two huge flashes that I think must have been transformers
            exploding – I think close to two million people in the area are without power
            right now. Yikes! Guess we were lucky on that count. Hope all of you were similarly
            fortunate.

	in the Washington Post (availble 
&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A55414-2003Sep23.html"&gt; here &lt;/a&gt;). It looks like MSFT will be limiting
 use of MSN Instant Messenger. What I can't figure out is how this
 affects me - if I have to start paying for it, 
I'd rather use AIM or ICQ, which are still free AFAIK. Especially
	since I use 
&lt;a href="www.trillian.cc"&gt;Trillian&lt;/a&gt;, since that means my UI won't change at
	all. But if all
 the people I want to talk to are going to be on MSN IM, then that makes it a harder choice... 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Does anyone know more about this? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here's the article text:

&lt;p&gt;
Wednesday, September 24, 2003; Page E02 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Microsoft said it is shutting down Internet chat services in most countries outside the United States and limiting U.S. service to help reduce criminal solicitations of children through the online discussions. The changes will take effect Oct. 14, Microsoft said. MSN will require U.S. users of its chat service to subscribe to at least one other paid MSN service. That way, the company will have credit card numbers to make it easier to track down users who violate MSN's terms of use.

            taught short courses at about 15 universities around the country, including MIT. There
            was a huge range of general competence amongst the undergrads I encountered. MIT had
            the best students I ran into, although Stanford and one or two others were also excellent.
            To hear Philip saying that the MIT students had a hard time with a technology does
            not bode well for its general applicability at other schools. You may want to take
            that with a grain of salt coming from me, though, because:

            the outside (of Java), Java looks almost exactly like C#/.NET to me – someone
            pointing out differences in productivity is a bit surprising.

            is far from the first time I’ve heard someone describe LISP as an advanced language.
            Given that I’ve been doing a bit of Emacs hacking lately, I might have to move
            really learning LISP well up on my TODO list.

            So MIT has this cool project where they are trying to make as much as possible of
            their course material available, for free, on the web. There are even some videotaped
            lectures up there. Find it &lt;a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. They’ve got
            over 500 courses up there now, although the quality and amount of material varies
            greatly from course to course.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I was talking to Rob Engberg, a friend of mine, and he pointed out the following sequence
            of courses that are available:
        &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;span style=";font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;2.75 Precision Machine Design Fall 2001&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-autospace:none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;
            &lt;span style=";font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;6.034 Artificial Intelligence Fall 2002&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

You might also have picked up that         I personally find myself more at the XML end of the spectrum, due in no small         part to the influence of &lt;a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/tewald/default.aspx"&gt;Tim         Ewald&lt;/a&gt;.      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         One day not too long ago, Tim rang me up to tell me about a revelation he had had.         He used to hate XmlSerializer because it embodies the fallacy that there's an isomorphism         between objects and XML. But he explained to me that if you looked at it in a different         way - simply as a convenient mechanism for populating a set of variables - that it         wasn't so bad. The idea being that in order to code against the XML, you're going         to have to find a way to pull the data out and get it into variables. XPath is one         way to do that, but so is XmlSerializer. I generally followed his argument at the         time, but it didn't really sink in until recently.      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         I was trying to rewrite some of the configuration code I'd done for one of my clients.         The issue was that we have a whole bunch of web projects, and having to make changes         in 17 different web.config files was annoying. So I wanted to set it up so we could         simply point to a single config file in a well-known directory.      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         I started off using a modified version of &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig/XmlSerializerSectionHandler.html"&gt;my         XmlSerializer configuration section handler&lt;/a&gt;. But as I was looking at it, I realized         that there was a better way. As it stands, the section handler expected XML in the         config file that looks like this:      &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;         &lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Lucida Console'; mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: maroon; FONT-FAMILY: 'Lucida Console'; mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"&gt;configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Lucida Console'; mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;         &lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Lucida Console'; mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"&gt;         &lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;         &lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Lucida Console'; mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #339966; FONT-FAMILY: 'Lucida Console'"&gt;&amp;lt;!--         configSections element goes here --&amp;gt; &lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;         &lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Lucida Console'; mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"&gt;         &lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;         &lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Lucida Console'; mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: maroon; FONT-FAMILY: 'Lucida Console'; mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"&gt;MyStuff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: fuchsia; FONT-FAMILY: 'Lucida Console'; mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: 'Lucida Console'; mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Lucida Console'; mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"&gt;="SomeNamespace.MyStuff,         CraigsConfig"&amp;gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;         &lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Lucida Console'; mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: maroon; FONT-FAMILY: 'Lucida Console'; mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Lucida Console'; mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Lucida Console'; mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"&gt;1.234&lt;span style="COLOR: blue"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="COLOR: maroon"&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="COLOR: blue"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>989</id><published>2003-10-08T11:38:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-10-08T11:38:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">Hi, you may probably interested in the Configuration Management Application Block created by Patterns And Practices Group in Redmond (i have coded the block).

This block solves the problem you describe here, and also allows a Write interface to the configuration can be changed by the applicatoin. Of course any IConfiguratoinSectionHandler can be reused with this block.

Hope you like it.

Or, in the case of CMAB, that you need a monolithic handler for something has simple as user preferences. Seems to me that with the framework's rich XML capabilities and the built-in support for the .config structure in System.Configuration, there'd be a clean way to go for basic preferences that formally went in the registry.

    &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I don’t claim to have read all the DirectX books on the market. These days there’s
            such a flood of material that reading everything on &lt;b&gt;any&lt;/b&gt; topic would be challenging.
            But my DirectX bookshelf has a fair number of books on it now…and none of them
            are very good. Most of them are barely any good at all. The one I’ve read most
            recently - &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735616531/qid=1066048820/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/002-2404028-2485622?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;n=507846"&gt;The
            Microsoft DirectX 9 Programmable Graphics Pipeline&lt;/a&gt; – was no exception. And
            I had such high hopes for it while I was checking it out in the bookstore.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The big problem I have with most books (true particularly for DirectX, but true in
            general) is that they go too far in one direction or the other. Either they have almost
            no information in them, or they assume that you already know the topic. The worst
            are introductory texts that take an academic approach. If I wanted an academic approach,
            I’d read the docs or the spec. If I want introductory, then all the formalism
            gets in the way. I reviewed a book recently that seemed to have exactly this problem
            – it was only a step better than a BNF description of the thing it was talking
            about. It just used English instead of { | and }.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ultimately, I want something that augments the specification/documentation, not replaces
            it. A good book has to have the primary goal of setting up a functional model in my
            head, so I can figure out &lt;i&gt;on my own&lt;/i&gt; why something might work the way it does
            when I encounter it in the API. It doesn’t even matter if the model is completely
            accurate if the text is introductory – a good analogy that I can ditch later
            when I have a more complete understanding of the domain is still extremely helpful
            even when it isn’t 100% accurate.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            This is how I learn, and therefore this is how I try to teach and how I try to write.
            Of course, different people learn different ways, but I just don’t believe that
            many are well-served by things that read like my college textbooks.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

But my point was a bit more general: everything I've read so far has been mediocre at best, and this is a tendency that goes beyond the DirectX literature.

Anyway, here's hoping that these two books will be a good read!

It’s an interesting idea, and appealing to             a cheap bastard like me since it’s free. And as email signing has been suggested             as a technology that could help combat spam, it appears to be worth looking into.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             The part I don’t like, though, is that I have to appear before a Notary in person.             See, I feel I have a fairly strong online identity – most people reading this             probably feel pretty confident that I am in fact Craig Andera, who works at DevelopMentor             and maintains this blog. So I’d like the opportunity to be awarded a cert based             on readers of this web log vouching for my identity. Basically, I’m viewing             my blog as an authentication mechanism – a sort of voiceprint if you will.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             Now, I certainly understand why they haven’t set it up this way – in general             blogs are a pretty weak form of authentication, and anyone could claim to be someone             else by setting up a weblog. But since I’m lazy and selfish, I just think about             my own particular case. The fact that I’m on the develop.com domain and have             been writing about generally the same things for months now could in theory act as             a reasonable assurance of my identity.         &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1007</id><published>2003-10-15T17:36:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-10-15T17:36:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">And how does Thawte's WOT differ from PGP?

I thought I’d             share the answer here, since I thought it was fairly clever.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             The problem stems from the fact that they have a database that has a table with columns             that can hold values like ‘Y’, ‘N’, ‘0’, or ‘1’             to indicate true/false. Yes, they know this was probably not the best way to do it.             No, they can’t change it, because there’s still a ton of existing code             that both reads and writes this data. So the question was, “When writing new             code, how do I get this to show up as a Boolean value in the DataSet?”         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             My first thought was to simply take care of the conversion in the SQL. If we knew             which database we were using, we could fairly easily write our query to simply turn             ‘Y’ and ‘1’ into true, and everything else into false. Unfortunately,             the application has to work against both SQL Server and Oracle. While I actually have             a way to deal with the differences in SQL between the two (more on that another time),             I was still hoping to find some magic in the System.Data stuff that would take care             of it for me.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             &lt;a href="http://staff.develop.com/bobb/"&gt;Bob Beauchemin&lt;/a&gt; – database guru             for DevelopMentor and all-around nice guy – turned me on to a nice way to handle             it. He pointed out that the DataSet has the ability to create derived columns, where             the value of the new column is computed using the value of existing columns and/or             some simple operators. Perfect! A quick test showed that the code for creating my             Boolean column looks something like this:         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="text-autospace:none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;             &lt;span style="; font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;// Retrieves a DataSet from the database             that has a Y/N/0/1 column called tfCol&lt;br /&gt;             DataSet ds = GetDataSet();&lt;br /&gt;             &lt;br /&gt;             &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="text-autospace:none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;             &lt;span style="; font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;DataColumn dc2 = new DataColumn("derivedCol",             typeof(bool), "&lt;b&gt;(tfCol = 'Y') OR (tfCol = '1')&lt;/b&gt;");&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="text-autospace:none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;             &lt;span style="; font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;ds.Tables[0].Columns.Add(dc2);&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="text-autospace:none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;             &lt;span style="; font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;             That’s really all there is to it – every row will now have a Boolean column             that will be true when the original column is ‘Y’ or ‘1’,             and false otherwise.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;                       &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;             The important part is the expression in the new DataColumn (which I’ve called             derivedCol). I’ve bolded the expression. Notice that I have the ability to use             comparison (=) and logical (OR) operators. There are a bunch more things you can do,             too. They’re listed under the DataColumn.Expression property in the docs.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;                       &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;             One other cool idea that Bob had was that I could suppress the original column (the             one with the Y/N values) from the serialized representation of the DataSet by also             setting the ColumnMapping property of the DataColumn to MappingType.Hidden, like so:         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;                       &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="text-autospace:none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;             &lt;span style="; font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;ds.Tables[0].Columns["tfCol"].ColumnMapping             = MappingType.Hidden;&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p style="text-autospace:none" class="MsoNormal"&gt;             &lt;span style="; font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;             If I do this, when serializing the DataSet to XML – as happens when returning             it from a WebMethod call – the tfCol column will not be included in the data             at all…but my derived column will. Which means that this is a fairly reasonable             and easy way to clean up the data before sending it off to the client.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;                       &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1011</id><published>2003-10-17T08:36:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-10-17T08:36:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">Did you have to handle updates from the DataSet ?

Even in my case, if I set the derived column to true, should I choose 'Y' or '1'? 

Of course, the DataSet provides enough hooks for you to write code that defines the right thing and makes it happen, but you're not going to get it automatically. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1010"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1013</id><published>2003-10-17T09:25:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-10-17T09:25:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">This Weblog Unavailable Saturday and Sunday</title><content type="html">     &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             Because of a scheduled outage by the power company that services the DevelopMentor             offices in California, this weblog (and all other staff.develop.com resources) will             be unavailable from 11PM PST, Saturday, October 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2003 through about             noon PST on Sunday the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             Note that this outage will &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; affect the main DevelopMentor website, nor will             it affect the discuss.develop.com mailing lists.         &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>1014</id><published>2003-10-17T13:19:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-10-17T13:19:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">New Direct3D Tutorial Available - Dealing With Device Loss</title><content type="html">     &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;         &lt;p&gt;              The Direct3D device can become lost due to a variety of events - screen savers             kicking in, computers being locked, or machines going into standby.

    &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            So, I’ve spent some time over the past couple of weeks looking at Microsoft’s
            Application Blocks. If you’re not familiar with these, you should know that
            they’re basically software written by the &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/practices/"&gt;Patterns
            &amp;amp; Practices group&lt;/a&gt; that’s aimed at solving common problems. For example,
            the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/daab-rm.asp"&gt;Data
            Access Application Block&lt;/a&gt; is a set of helper classes aimed at making data access
            easier. They’re generally the sort of thing that you write yourself after you’ve
            written the same two hundred lines of code three or four times. Only now Microsoft
            writes it for you. They even give you the source code.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Unfortunately, as much as I hate to say it, I think these aren’t quite ready
            for prime time. I really wanted to like them, not least because I had a nice conversation
            with Ron Jacobs from the Patterns &amp;amp; Practices group about them, and he seemed
            like a smart, helpful guy. But there are a bunch of little things that just tell me
            I’m not likely to get much use from them. Like:
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;
            &lt;span style="font-family:Symbol"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The
            Data Access Application Block currently only works with SQL Server. You can get bits
            from gotdotnet that make it work with Oracle, but it doesn’t do anything to
            make the differences between the two databases go away. Not that I necessarily think
            they could – but at that point, what value am I getting from the code?
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;
            &lt;span style="font-family:Symbol"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/emab-rm.asp"&gt;Exception
            Management Application Block&lt;/a&gt; only does some of what the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/LogSchema/html/ls_logging_EI_overview.asp"&gt;Enterprise
            Instrumentation Framework&lt;/a&gt; does. Granted, it was written sort of simultaneously
            with EIF, but again, where’s the value if there’s something better available?
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The really telling ones, though, are things like:
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;
            &lt;span style="font-family:Symbol"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The
            documentation contains factual errors, claiming at one point that the CLR will load
            the assembly with the highest build and revision number where the major and minor
            version numbers match the requested version. This was true briefly in one of the betas,
            but has never been true in the released CLR.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;
            &lt;span style="font-family:Symbol"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/LogSchema/html/ls_logging_EI_overview.asp"&gt;Configuration
            Management Application Block&lt;/a&gt; – which at first looked to be one of the most
            useful of the bunch – contains some fairly rookie-type threading bugs.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            These last two just kill me. If I’m really going to use this code in my products,
            it has to inspire confidence that it was written by someone who knows the problem
            domain at least as well as I do. Demonstrating a misunderstanding of the platform
            and of basic threading principles don’t achieve that. I emailed the team about
            the thread bug, hoping to hear back from them, but it’s been over a week and
            nary a word, so here I blog.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            That said, I should point out four things. First, that these blocks are the group’s
            first attempt, and no one gets anything right on the first try. I expect their next
            version will be significantly better. Second, that I didn’t get elbow-deep into
            all the blocks, so I might be missing a cool one. Third, that what doesn’t work
            for me might work for you. And finally, that the group produces a lot more than just
            these blocks, including some fairly decent whitepapers on things like &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnnetsec/html/ThreatCounter.asp"&gt;security&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/tdlg_rm.asp"&gt;team
            development with VS.NET&lt;/a&gt; – all stuff I’ve heard my clients beg Microsoft
            to do for years. So they’ve moving in the right direction.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

I find sample apps consider just the most basic of cases, these app blocks actually consider realistic scenarios.  I had some issues with the User Interface Process block but it was still valuable to me to be able to take a look at how someone else might do it.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1015"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1019</id><published>2003-10-23T00:06:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-10-23T00:06:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">I actually do not agree.  We have used the data and exception blocks on a couple projects and I have been happy with the results.  There is a new version of the Data Access block which does abstract the type of database, so you can use any ADO.NET provider. (Version 3.0, Workspaces) 

There are some errors with the application blocks, but the nice thing is that you can freely modify them since all of the code is included. Could you write something better and more tailored to your situation? Sure, if time was not an issue we would all write everything custom... but for most people the time saved by the application blocks, and the functionality provided, can't be beat.

So methinks, if James Avery and Jon Box are using them....well, that's good enough for me! But I guess for me the point is that even though i'm 150% positive that the folks on the architecture team are way better architects and coders than me :-), I like to construct my own functions and tools for shortcuts. In the long run, it still cuts down my coding time when I use mine. So then is the argument...do I think I"m smarter than them? NO of course not. But they are writing something that will cover every base for everyone - lots and lots of code. It's like some of the 3rd party tools (well I guess these are too) that are really bloated so that they can be used in 1000 scenarios. And in the case of the data access block, it still has hole in it  - like returning datatables, which I do all of the time. One of those little things people never know - dataadapter fill can fill a datatable. So people using the blocks will never know about this feature.

On them being better than writing it myself: like I said, your requirements are going to be different than mine. If they work for you, then cool! I, however, was going to wind up spending more time coming through it and guaranteeing correctness than I was replicating the 30% of the block that I actually need. Will I still have to debug my stuff? Yes, but I'll have a comprehensive mental model, and something more suited to exactly what I'm doing.

If software is all about the people, the app blocks are all about yourselves.

I sited             a general documentation bug and a Configuration Management Application Block threading             bug as key indicators that the software isn’t ready for prime time. And I said             that I hadn’t heard back from them after reporting the bug.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             Well, I’m going to eat my words on two of those: the threading bug doesn’t             exist, and not only did the Patterns and Practices group get back to me, the email             was written &lt;b&gt;before&lt;/b&gt; I posted the blog entry…I just hadn’t checked             that particular email inbox that day. And the team is aware of the documentation bug             and plans to fix it.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             For the record, the threading bug I thought I saw was related to a Hashtable maintained             in the MemoryCache class. I noticed two things about it: First, that they weren’t             using the Synchronized wrapper. Second that even though they were taking a lock on             writes, they weren’t locking on reads. This is not, in general, safe to do.             In particular, it’s not safe to enumerate over a Hashtable at the same time             a write is occurring.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             As it turns out, the CMAB implementation is safe because they never enumerate over             the collection. And since the Hashtable is a private field, no one else can, either.             Not using a Synchronized Hashtable is fine in their case because they do the lock             on write (which is all the Synchronized wrapper does anyway). Locks on simple reads             through the indexer are not necessary with a Hashtable – only on enumeration.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             On top of all this, the response from the Patterns and Practices team was really good.             I think I got about four phone calls and twenty or so emails from Microsoft people             in response to my feedback. And the dev lead himself walked through the code, took             the time to verify that the problem I thought I saw wasn’t there, and let me             know…over the weekend. Kudos!         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;             Now I just have to figure out if it’s worth it for me to go in and change my             code around to use the Configuration Management Application Block again. I wrote my             own version that I’m employing, and of course it’s slightly different,             and tailored specifically to my view of the configuration management problem. Microsoft’s             stuff is obviously superior in many respects, as it has been more carefully architected             and more thoroughly tested…and they’ve clearly got a great team backing             it up. The only thing stopping me from leveraging their stuff is that what I’ve             got now works. I think. :)         &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>3815</id><published>2004-12-10T00:36:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-12-10T00:36:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Threading and the Hashtable</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1028"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1029</id><published>2003-10-27T09:30:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-10-27T09:30:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Sometimes It Makes You Proud to Be an Alumni</title><content type="html">

    &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            By way of &lt;a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/03/OleOnLonghorn"&gt;Tim
            Bray&lt;/a&gt;, I read Ole Eichhorn’s &lt;a href="http://w-uh.com/index.cgi/articles/031102-emperors_new_code.html"&gt;rant
            about Longhorn&lt;/a&gt;. While I find it interesting and in places insightful, I think
            he was a bit wide of the mark. The basic mistake he made is an &lt;b&gt;extremely&lt;/b&gt; common
            one: the assumption that all software is the same. Usually, this is coupled with “and
            it’s the same as the software I write.”
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I’ve fallen victim to this particular trap myself. One of the major foci in
            my career has been the development of large-scale systems. As such, you’ll often
            find me saying things like, “Extra database roundtrips are bad.” Or, “Avoid
            building objects that map directly to tables and handle their own persistence.”
            Both of these are good pieces of advice…if you’re building a system that
            needs to scale. But of course, if you’re writing a system that’s going
            to be used by ten people ever, you should ignore this and do what’s easy. And
            lots of people are indeed writing these sorts of smaller systems, which is a totally
            legitimate thing to do.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The keys to being a good architect are 1) knowing what the rules are, and 2) why they
            are that when so you know &lt;b&gt;when to ignore them&lt;/b&gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            So, does Ole have a good point about performance? Yes…if it’s going to
            impact you. But in point of fact not everyone is writing the next version of Excel.
            There are plenty of applications for which developer productivity is more important
            than an extra 10% (or whatever) in response time. And of course the jury’s still
            out on what the performance penalty will be. And of course it’ll be different
            for every application anyway. But in any event I’d argue that there are at least
            ten times as many departmental one-off applications being written as there are commercial
            shrink-wrap ones. Whether or not these are “important apps” (Ole’s
            term) sort of depends on where you sit.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            But Ole’s bit does beg the question, “Is Microsoft right to continue to
            emphasize developer productivity?” I think it’s obvious that they are
            – the CLR’s big win is clearly this, and it looks like the Longhorn technologies
            continue largely in this vein. But you have to ask, “Is this good for the users,
            who outnumber the developers by some large factor?”
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I don’t know the answer to that. What I do know is that it reminds me of another
            familiar market: commercial broadcasting, particularly TV. I often wonder at how bad
            broadcast TV is. Sure, there are some shows I like, but a lot of it sucks. There are
            two conclusions I can draw from this: 1) that most people have taste that differs
            from mine, or 2) the viewer’s preferences are not the controlling factor. While
            the former is probably true, it’s the latter factor that’s interesting
            here, because from a commercial standpoint, it’s demonstrably true. Advertisers,
            after all, pay for the programs, not viewers. So the broadcasters are &lt;b&gt;directly&lt;/b&gt; beholden
            to advertisers, but only &lt;b&gt;indirectly&lt;/b&gt; beholden to viewers. And note that for
            the networks where this is not true, like HBO and public television, we get a noticeably
            different spectrum of programming.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            In Microsoft’s case, we actually have the opposite correlation. The revenue
            comes from products like the OS and like Office, and not from Visual Studio.NET and
            the CLR. Sure, there’s a linkage – developers create the software that
            users’ consume, making the platform more attractive to said users – but
            again it’s &lt;b&gt;indirect&lt;/b&gt; rather than &lt;b&gt;direct&lt;/b&gt;. I’m not sure what
            this means…but I find it interesting.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;I started reading Bruce Schneier's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0387026207/qid=1068043965//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i0_xgl14/103-1122417-2788650?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;n=507846"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beyond
        Fear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last night. It looks like it's going to be just great. He's an
        excellent writer, and the material is so relevant. More importantly, it says a lot
        of totally true stuff that is completely counter to conventional "wisdom".&lt;/font&gt; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;So far, the biggest theme is "Develop a threat model",
        or, if you like, "Know thy enemy." So often, people post questions on the mailing
        lists I frequent that go something like, "Should I use encryption?" And the answer
        is always, "Who are you trying to protect against?"&lt;/font&gt; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;Unfortunately, answering the latter question is harder,
        probably because it is often out of the programmer's control. If more managers, executives,
        and end users would read Schneier's book (as well as the excellent &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0471253111/ref=pd_sim_books_2/103-1122417-2788650?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secrets
        and Lies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), talking and making intelligent decisions about security would
        become much easier. Order a copy for your boss today. ;)&lt;/font&gt;

I         said it was a good article, and I still think it is. But Ian Griffiths wrote me up         to take issue with the fact that that's &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; I said - he felt         that the article in and of itself does not actually tell you anything directly useful...and         I agree.&lt;/font&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;Ian and I have both done more than our share of optimization,         and we've both arrived at the same set of rules:&lt;/font&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;1. Don't do anything intentionally stupid when first writing         the code, but &lt;br /&gt;         2. Don't spend a lot of time trying to write really fast code up front. Instead,&lt;br /&gt;         3. Measure, then optimize the slowest thing.&lt;br /&gt;         4. Repeat until performance is good enough.&lt;/font&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;These rules will hardly be surprising to anyone that's         succesfully done performance improvement work. But they surprise the hell out of a         lot of people nonetheless. "I thought writing fast applications was all about knowing         which sorting algorithm to use and which data structure to pick?" Not really.&lt;/font&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;I used to work at a mortgage company where I sat next         to Jon, a good friend of mine. People would often come to me with a C++ program and         tell me that it was too slow. The first question I would ask them is, "Have you talked         to Jon yet?" When they said, "No," I'd tell them to go away. See, Jon used to work         at Oracle, developing bits of the database, so he knew SQL up and down. He would &lt;em&gt;routinely&lt;/em&gt; make         queries that originally ran in half an hour, run in 30 seconds. As a pretty good C++         programmer, I could expect to decrease execution time by about 10%, or maybe 25% if         I was really lucky. A sixty-fold performance improvement was out of my league...but         Jon did it all the time.&lt;/font&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;As another example, while profiling a web service I've         been writing, I found that the following line of code was the slowest thing in the         app:&lt;/font&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         &lt;font size="4"&gt;RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa = &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;new&lt;/font&gt; RSACryptoServiceProvider(cp);&lt;/font&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;And I mean it was by far the slowest thing in the app         - making this call less frequently had a &lt;em&gt;significant&lt;/em&gt; impact on throughput.         I don't remember what the timing on the call was exactly, but I never would have guessed         that a constructor call could take as long as this did.&lt;/font&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;All this goes to explain why I claim that the article         is useful, but not directly useful: because when it comes time to optimize, you have         to measure the slowest thing and fix that. Anything else is a waste of time. And you'll         probably be surprised by what the slowest thing is. And it's likely &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; going         to be slow due to any of the things from the article - at the point where you're worrying         about the performance of fields versus properties, you've almost certainly already         optimized a whole bunch of other stuff that's going to be the dominant factor.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;But         at the same, there may come a time when knowing that the C# &lt;strong&gt;as&lt;/strong&gt; operator         is twice as slow as the cast operator in some situations might save you a few hours.&lt;/font&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;The life of a performance optimizer is a tough one: you         have to know everything about how the app works, down to the silicon, since you never         know what the bottleneck is going to be. (This is an outcome of the &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html"&gt;Law         of Leaky Abstractions&lt;/a&gt;.) But since this is waaaay too much to keep in your head         for even a trivial app these days, we need to just make our best guess when first         writing the app, then measure to zoom in on the places where bad things are happening.&lt;/font&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;Oh, and don't forget step #4: stop optimizing when performance         is good enough - you're just wasting money after that. Of course, that assumes that         you can get a definition of "good enough" from the customer, but maybe that's a post         for another time. ;) In the meantime, &lt;a href="href"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>1040</id><published>2003-11-07T06:51:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-11-07T06:51:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">C# Direct3D Sprite Example</title><content type="html">

            David Weller has &lt;a href="http://www.inkblog.com/default.aspx?date=2003-10-29"&gt;a short
            example&lt;/a&gt; of using the Direct3DX Sprite class from C#. The example only works if

            Update of the DirectX SDK&lt;/a&gt;, and even then I have had a few problems. Regardless,
            I’m sure David will fix them soon, and the code alone is very handy to demonstrate
            technique. You’ll find it particularly useful if you plan to write a 2D game
            using Direct3D. Which &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/explosionman"&gt;I will&lt;/a&gt;,

    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;Most of my development work until recently has been either
        without source control (gasp!) or using Visual SourceSafe. Well, for the last year
        I've been doing a lot of development, and have unsurprisingly come to really like
        source control. At home, I use CVS to do things like track changes to my website,
        so I can roll back if I screw something up. At work, I use it for the usual purpose:
        coordinating work on the same codebase with other developers.&lt;/font&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;One of my clients is currently evaluating a new source
        code control system - Borland's StarTeam. It looks pretty nice, and there's a reasonable
        chance they'll implement it. Since I'm doing prototype work for them, I'm using it
        exclusively right now. Having experience with CVS and one or two other non-Visual
        SourceSafe products, it wasn't too hard to get used to the model. But it's going to
        be a stretch for some of their developers who haven't used a merge model source control
        system before, the same way it hurt my brain a bit when I moved off of SourceSafe.&lt;/font&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;One of the things that I've found helpful is to picture
        the various states a file can be in as a grid. The grid tracks the state of the file
        in the repository versus the state of the file in the working directory. The file
        can be in one of three states in each of these two places: unchanged, changed, or
        not present. "Changed" and "unchanged" are relative to the file in the &lt;strong&gt;other&lt;/strong&gt; location,
        so "changed" on the repository axis means that the file in the working directory has
        changes relative to the working directory (i.e. someone else has checked in a new
        revision since you checked it out).&lt;/font&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;Because one of the things that differs between source
        control systems is the terminology, the really valuable part of the grid (for me)
        is the intersections, where I record the meaning of each of the possible combinations.
        Here's what the grid for StarTeam looks like:&lt;/font&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;             
                         
        Working Directory&lt;br /&gt;
                          
             Unchanged    Changed   Not Present&lt;br /&gt;
                                ---------   
        -------   -----------&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
                       
        Unch |   Current     Modified    Missing&lt;br /&gt;
        Repository       Chg | Out of date    Merge  
           Missing&lt;br /&gt;
                    Not Pres |
        Not in view  Not in view    N/A&lt;/font&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;It should be fairly straightforward to substitute the
        terms from your source control system for the StarTeam ones. Note that this chart
        is a simplification of what's really going on - it doesn't help you figure out branching,
        for example - but I found it useful as a starting point, and hopefully this will help

        &lt;font size="+0"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In V1, ASP.NET hit
        a home run by focusing like a laser beam on the developer experience.  Everyone
        put so much effort into building apps, questioning why each step was necessary, and
        refining the process.  It's great to see that they continue to follow that same
        discipline.  In the drill-down sessions, over and over again I saw that focus
        resulting in a near perfect experience for developers.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; There
        are some other teams, like Avalon, that seem to have a similar religion and are obtaining
        similar results.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; (Though Avalon desperately
        needs some tools support.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Notepad is
        fine for authoring XAML in demos, but I wouldn't want to build a real application
        this way).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt; 
    &lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"&gt;
        &lt;span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;span class="524250419-10112003"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;This
        really reinforces what I've been learning over the last year, as the amount of "real
        code" I've been writing has skyrocketed from my previous mostly-research-and-sample-code
        lifestyle. API design is tough, but when you get it right, it makes a world of difference. &lt;a href="www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/"&gt;Don&lt;/a&gt; talks
        about this on &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20030827SOAPDB/manifest.xml"&gt;MSDN
        TV&lt;/a&gt;, where he speaks at some length about the value and danger of abstractions.
        It's one of the main reasons I have hope for Indigo. And it's one of the main reasons
        that I worry about WinFS: if the API anything like the ADSI model (or the OLEDB model),
        forget it: no one will ever use it. Those that do will hate it. But I've looked
        at neither in depth, so this jury is still out. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;span class="524250419-10112003"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I’m still reading &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0387026207/qid=1068572201/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/002-2404028-2485622?v=glance&amp;amp;n=507846"&gt;Beyond
            Fear&lt;/a&gt; a bit at a time…it’s still excellent. As a species we just &lt;b&gt;don’t&lt;/b&gt; get
            security, something that has become even more clear in the US in the last two years.
            My favorite quote so far:
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in"&gt;
            &lt;i&gt;I have a friend who has, on almost every one of the many flights he has taken since
            9/11, presented his homemade “Martian League” photo ID at airport security
            checkpoints – an ID that explicitly states that he is a “diplomatic official
            of an alien government.” In the few instances when someone notices that he is
            not showing an official ID, they simply ask for a valid driver’s license and
            allow him to board without a second glance. When he noticed that the gate agents were
            scrutinizing expiration dates on IDs, he simply made another version of his Martian
            League card that included one.&lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Aside from being amusing, what’s interesting is that – in the context
            of the book – the conclusion we draw isn’t, “Airport screeners are
            stupid,” but rather, “Authentication is a hard problem, and is misapplied
            and inappropriately used at airports.”
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;I'm running smack into two big limitations of WSDL.EXE,
        the tool used to generate client-side proxies for web services in .NET. Specifically,
        here are the problems:&lt;/font&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;1) WSDL.EXE relies on the same code as XSD.EXE to map
        the XML types into programmatic types. Unfortunately, it generates types with public
        fields rather than properties. This prohibits data binding. I'd like to change this.&lt;br /&gt;
        2) If you run WSDL.EXE against two different WSDL documents with exactly the same
        XSD type in them, it generates two programmatic types. That is &amp;lt;foo/&amp;gt; turns
        into NamespaceA.Foo and NamespaceB.Foo. This is a problem if you want to read a Foo
        from web service A and pass it to web service B.&lt;/font&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;Neither of these problems are insurmountable. The problem
        is the solutions aren't elegant. Better than either would be for someone to tell me,
        "Hey, you just need to download SuperWsdl.exe; it does everything you need." Unfortunately,
        I'm not sure SuperWsdl.exe exists. I'd prefer not to write it myself.&lt;/font&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;Anyone got any advice? Leave a comment.&lt;/font&gt;

http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=ef3d0a73-0468-46da-8780-ede0f12b6f22
It handles problem 1 for you, but I don't think it handles problem 2. Also, it's packaged as a custom tool - don't know if it's callable from the command line.

One thing that I didn't like about Atif's solution is that it doesn't act as a drop-in replacement for Microsoft's custom tool. It uses it's own XML file, which means no "Add Web Reference" support in VS.NET. So I started writing my own version, which does let you use "Add Web Reference". It's basically working, but I've been so busy with work I have had a chance to clean it up and release it yet. Hopefully I'll get around to it some day soon. Again, it only solves problem 1, though.

I tried bash for a while (under &lt;a href="http://www.cygwin.com/"&gt;Cygwin&lt;/a&gt;), and that was pretty cool. It took me back to my Unix days, and is clearly a first-rate product. But I kept running into differences between Windows idea of paths (e.g. C:\data\writing) and Cgywin’s idea of a path (e.g. /c/data/writing). Personally, I like forward slashes better, but since I’m stuck with Windows pathnames for a lot of applications, I was sort of screwed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the course of thinking about the problem, I actually realized that I really have two requirements that I had been confusing: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) A nice interactive shell for doing things like executing programs and listing directories.&lt;br /&gt;2) A scripting language for automating repetitive tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shells like bash and tcsh address both features, but really, they’re two separate things, and a large part of the value comes from all the other little command-line tools that are part of something like Cygwin, rather than from the shell itself. Those are available separately, so I figured if I could find two different products to satisfy both needs, then I’d be set. I’m playing with &lt;a href="http://www.python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; to see what I think of it for requirement #2. C# is an option there, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To figure out what to do about my first requirement, I asked around a bit, and some hard-core developers over on the &lt;a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/"&gt;Off-Topic Mailing List&lt;/a&gt; pointed me to &lt;a href="http://www.jpsoft.com/4ntdes.htm"&gt;4NT&lt;/a&gt; as a good replacement for the Windows command shell. I downloaded the trial and had to agree that it is indeed pretty darn cool. But I think I’m going to stick with cmd.exe. The big reason I’m even contemplating this is this registry key: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:"&gt;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\AutoRun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the documentation, if you list a file under this key, it will be run at the start of every cmd.exe session. Well, this is awesome. It means that I can set it to something like &lt;b&gt;C:\home\cmdrc.cmd&lt;/b&gt; and then populate the file with something like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:"&gt;@echo Running cmdrc.cmd&lt;br /&gt;@SET PATH=c:\bin;%PATH%&lt;br /&gt;@SET PATH=c:\bin ant-0.8.3.50105;%PATH%&lt;br /&gt;@call vsvars32.bat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, whenever I fire up cmd.exe, it sets my path appropriately, and executes the vsvars32.bat file, which does all sorts of environmental goodness to enable programs like the C# compiler from the command line. Best of all, when I add a new program that I want to be able to run from the command line, I just have to throw a new line into my cmdrc.cmd file, and restart any command shells I have open. This is waaaay better than having to much around with the environment variables dialog box and having to kill explorer.exe. Plus, when I reinstall my system, it’s just a matter of copying this file over to preserve all my hard-fought configuration. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I’ve just created a new GotDotNet &lt;a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=cbef68e4-07e7-492a-b9a5-3902ae6a179c"&gt;workspace&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=cbef68e4-07e7-492a-b9a5-3902ae6a179c"&gt;ftpsync&lt;/a&gt;,
            the tool I’ve been writing this weekend when I should have been doing work.
            But you know how it goes – you sit down to update your webpage, you get tired
            of trying to figure out which files you’ve changed since the last upload, you
            look around for a free tool that does incremental FTP upload, and you don’t
            find anything free and good. So you write one yourself…we’ve all been
            there, right?
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            It turned out reasonably well, given that I only worked on it for a few hours, so
            I figure I’d throw it up on a workspace and see what happens. It needs better
            error handling, and I’m not super-happy about the FTP library I’m using
            (&lt;a href="http://www.enterprisedt.com/downloads/csftp/csftp.html"&gt;edtFTPnet&lt;/a&gt;),
            which saved me a ton of time, but has an interface which is a bit clunky, and has
            somewhat weird error handling. Of course, it works and it’s free, so I’m
            not complaining too much.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Basic usage of the tool goes something like this:
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;"&gt;ftpsync -s my.ftp.server.com -u myusername
            -p mypassword -ld C:\local\directory -rd /initial/remote/directory&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            This would cause the program to upload via FTP anything that lives in C:\local\directory
            that either
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;
            1.&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt; Isn’t
            present on the FTP server, or
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;
            2.&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt; Is
            present on the FTP server but is older that what’s in the local directory
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            You can add the -r switch to recurse directories, and the -rd switch to delete anything
            on the remote server that isn’t on the present server. I also threw in support
            for the ignore files (-if) and ignore directories (-id) switches. Oh, and a –debug
            switch that spews tons of extra info.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Anyway, I’ve already had success integrating this into a Nant build that I run
            to update this website, so I’m getting my money’s worth. It seems stable
            enough, but if there are feature requests or bug reports, leave a note on the workspace…or
            better yet, join and upgrade/fix it yourself ;) .
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

I intended to include source control awareness into my solution - so it could look into VSS/Vault and only compare files which have been changed recently (can't always depend on file system dates if you clear out your working directory everything has the same date) and also to perform a deployment based on a label.

I think this is defintely a niche area where tools could be written to make our lives easier...especially those living in strict configuration management environments (like where I current work).</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1075"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1079</id><published>2003-11-17T08:16:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-11-17T08:16:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">Yeah, one of the problems I ran into was exactly that - the dates all get updated when you do a CVS checkout into an empty directory.

What would be better would be a switch that says, "Check out and set the file timestamp to the repository timestamp." </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1075"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1080</id><published>2003-11-17T13:08:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-11-17T13:08:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Who Needs an Architect?</title><content type="html">

        &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;I think &lt;a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/whoNeedsArchitect.pdf"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is
        a great, short read. It takes a crack at defining a taxonomy of the role of "architect"
        and does a passable job of explaining why the term is so nebulous to begin with. The
        dig at the AOP at the end didn't hurt my opinion of the piece, either. ;)&lt;/font&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;The last company I worked at called pretty much everyone
        an architect. That always seemed weird. Now I have a better idea why.&lt;/font&gt;

    &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I ran into something that took me almost all of yesterday to figure out. I was trying
            to set up a series of virtual directories in IIS. The basic idea was that I had a
            set of ASPX pages and a set of ASP.NET Web Services, and that they should be organized
            under a single URL, like http://localhost/MyApplication.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I couldn’t put everything into the same virtual directory, because we already
            had a disk structure defined that located the ASMX and ASPX pages in different places.
            So I figured I’d map /MyApplication to the ASPX directory, and just create a
            child virtual directory like /MyApplication/WebServices that mapped to the ASMX directory.
            (You did know that virtual directories can contain other virtual directories, didn’t
            you? And that they can point to any physical directory, even one that isn’t
            a child of the parent vdir’s physical directory?)
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The problem I ran into immediately with this approach was that some of the settings
            in my ASPX web.config were incompatible with my web services. This is a problem because
            many web.config settings are inherited by child virtual directories. My solution to
            this was to create &lt;b&gt;two&lt;/b&gt; children of /MyApplication - /MyApplication/UI and /MyApplication/WebServices.
            Both children had to be proper virtual directories, and not just regular directories
            underneath a virtual directory. This is because
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;
            1)&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt; The
            two physical directories in question don’t share a common parent physical directory,
            and
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;
            2)&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt; Some
            of the things in my web.config file only work when the web.config file lives in a
            virtual directory root.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            It was a bit annoying that I was going to have to type http://localhost/MyApplication/UI
            instead of http://localhost/MyApplication to get to the ASPX pages, but it’s
            a minor annoyance, and if it really bugs me I can fix it later with a server-side
            remapping or a simple client-side redirect. So I mapped the parent virtual directory
            off to a random empty directory on my hard drive, mapped the two child vdirs off to
            the appropriate place, and went on coding.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Everything was going great until I tried to install the stuff on someone else’s
            machine. I’d written a setup script, and although it seemed to run to completion,
            the app didn’t work when I was done. It was failing in all sorts of weird ways,
            doing things it just shouldn’t. Most troubling was when it would error out because
            it couldn’t find the current username…because even though I had ASP.NET
            Forms Authentication set up, it was never redirecting to the login page!
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ultimately, I found the answer through trial and error. It turns out that during setup,
            the check-out from source control wasn’t creating the empty directory that the
            parent directory virtual directory was mapped to. And for whatever reason, if you
            have nested virtual directories, if the parent directory does not exist, &lt;b&gt;ASP.NET
            completely ignores the web.config files in the child virtual directories&lt;/b&gt;. Leading
            to the highly confusing behavior I mentioned. The solution was simple: just make sure
            the parent vdir points to a valid physical directory, and everything returns to normal.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;I've always been a big fan of shortcut keys. Today I happened
        to mistakenly hit a few keys, and discovered a few more I never knew about (this is
        on Windows XP).&lt;/font&gt; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;WinKey + LeftArrow = Minimize Current Window&lt;br /&gt;
        WinKey + UpArrow  = Maximize Current Window&lt;br /&gt;
        WinKey + DownArrow = Restore Current Window&lt;/font&gt; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;Now if I could just find the shortcut key for FixBug.
        Or better yet, CureSleep.&lt;/font&gt; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm a big fat idiot. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        So it seems these aren't commands that are built into the shell, but rather just some
        of the default mappings added by &lt;a href="http://www.copernic.com/winkey"&gt;WinKey&lt;/a&gt;.
        WinKey totally rocks - I use it so much, I even forget that it's there. Like I did
        for this post.

            to test-driven development &lt;a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/Test-Driven%20Development%20in%20.NET.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
             Although I haven’t yet read any of the Extreme Programming canon, I have
            been doing a &lt;b&gt;lot&lt;/b&gt; more programming over the last year than was previously the
            case, and I find myself gravitating naturally towards some of the precepts of XP.
            I’d love to give Test-Driven Development a full-blown try, but when you’re
            a consultant, you have to go with what the client wants. Maybe I can find a way to
            work it in to one of my side projects.

    &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Well, we made it back from Switzerland. West is the easy direction in terms of jet
            lag, but I’m starting to droop pretty badly at the moment. Hopefully that means
            I’ll get a solid night’s sleep tonight – I woke up at midnight Zurich-local
            time last night, and couldn’t get back to sleep before the alarm went off at
            3:15AM so we could catch our flight.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            At any rate, the conference was great. Most of the sessions were in German, but there
            were a few in English. Based on the ones I did catch, I think the attendees got a
            really great deal. And I had a great time delivering my talks on threading and on
            Managed DirectX. The Managed DirectX one in particular went quite well – I managed
            to cover the absolute basics of Direct3D, DirectSound, DirectInput, and DirectPlay
            (including nine demos that all worked!) in 80 minutes. The slides and demos should
            be up on the conference website either now or in the near future, but since I can’t
            read German, it’s pretty hard for me to figure out which link it is, so I’ll
            be posting the content here as well. Just give me a few days to dig through my email
            and recover mentally.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The conference was also enjoyable in that I got to see some old friends as well as
            make some new ones. I’ll refrain from doing the Great Blog Name Drop and listing
            them, but I have to thank &lt;a href="http://www.corti.com/WeblogSascha/"&gt;Sascha Corti&lt;/a&gt; in
            particular for acting the perfect host. My wife and I both felt extremely welcome
            and well taken care of.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Now that I’m back and no longer have conference talk prep work to do, I can
            devote some time to a few projects that I’ve had on hold. In particular, I want
            to get my blog ported to &lt;a href="http://www.dasblog.net/"&gt;dasBlog 1.5&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/viewuploads.aspx?id=77a29128-4746-4473-b676-e4f1517a1907"&gt;just
            released&lt;/a&gt;), to write the next article or articles in my Direct3D series (I’ve
            done a bunch of reading and understand some things better now) and to finally get
            a start on one or two games that I’ve been wanting to write. We’ll see
            how it all goes what with the holidays and all the other, normal things that need
            doing.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            You may have seen on the news that there was a small earthquake near Richmond, Virginia.
            I live near Washington, D.C., about 100 miles from the epicenter. Here’s how
            it went for me:
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Wife: Did you hear something?&lt;br /&gt;
            Me: No.&lt;br /&gt;
            Wife: I’m from the Pacific Rim. That felt like an earthquake.&lt;br /&gt;
            Me: I didn’t feel anything.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            She was right, of course. She usually is.
        &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="Section1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;i&gt;Here’s a little something I wrote last week that somehow never made it onto
            this blog:&lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I’m here at &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/switzerland/de/devdays2003/"&gt;DevDays&lt;/a&gt; in
            Zurich, Switzerland. My talks start in about two hours, and I find myself with a few
            spare minutes.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I just got done listening to an interesting presentation by &lt;a href="http://www.projectbotticelli.co.uk/"&gt;Rafal
            Lukawiecki&lt;/a&gt; on IPv6. It was interesting not only because Rafal is a good speaker
            and the topic a relevant one, but because of a comment he made that resonated with
            me, particularly so since I was (probably) the only American in a European crowd of
            300 or so.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Rafal observed that the current version of IP (IPv4) has an incredibly uneven distribution
            of addresses. In particular, he noted that some US universities have more addresses
            assigned to them than &lt;i&gt;the entire continent of Asia&lt;/i&gt;. While I found that surprising
            enough, what really caught me was the implicit sense that having a global Internet
            infrastructure that depends disproportionately on the US is a bad thing. This makes
            logical sense for purely technical reasons, of course, but Rafal’s comments
            made it clear that from a &lt;i&gt;social&lt;/i&gt; standpoint, the appeal of IPv6 would not be
            hurt by the current political climate.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I find the idea that the adoption of IPv6 might be due in part to the current US administration’s
            global policies [1] amusing, troubling, and an excellent example of the &lt;a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/UnintendedConsequences.html"&gt;Law
            of Unintended Consequences.&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            [1] Policies with which I largely disagree, but I’ll leave it at that in this
            forum.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        Well, it was sort of painful, but I got the site up and running on dasBlog. Which,
        I have to say, is a fairly big improvement on BlogX. If I can convince the powers-that-be
        to somehow install CDO on the web server I run the site on, it’ll be even better,
        since dasBlog has some nice email-related features.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Sorry if your aggregator blew a bunch of recent entries in your face as being new
        – not much I could do about that. At any rate, it shouldn’t happen again
        any time soon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        If you have any problems with the site or the feed, let me know by leaving a comment
        here or by sending me an email, and I’ll get it fixed.

    &lt;p&gt;
        I’ve lately been reading &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1558605932/qid=1071323721/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i7_xgl14/002-2404028-2485622?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;n=507846"&gt;3D
        Game Engine Design : A Practical Approach to Real-Time Computer Graphics&lt;/a&gt;. It is
        excellent. It’s exactly the book I’ve been looking for on my quest to
        understand Direct3D better – it starts with talking about how a generic render
        pipeline works and from there moves into things like collision detection, terrain
        generation, and all sorts of good stuff.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        But before you run out and buy it, a few caveats:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;
        &lt;span style="font-family:Symbol"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The
        book is extremely thorough. In graphics, this means there are scads of equations.
        While I think it’s important to understand vector and matrix operations if you
        want to do 3D game work, I’ve been able to read the book without actually going
        through most of the proofs and derivations. “OK, there’s a formula for
        intersecting a triangle and a sphere. I’ll come back to the details if I ever
        need them. Knowing where the formula is suffices for now.”
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;
        &lt;span style="font-family:Symbol"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It
        is not DirectX-specific. It’s fairly technology-agnostic, in fact. So if you’re
        looking for something to teach you the API, don’t look here.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        If you want some good theory and a big pile of pseudocode, I recommend it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

And as you already know, he has C and C++ code for the algorithms he presents, which can help with understanding the implementation details. 

But if you are attending college, I *highly* recommend taking as much math as you can...it's the secret to the universe. ;) </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1124"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1127</id><published>2003-12-15T13:06:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-12-15T13:06:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Excellent Game Programming Book</title><content type="html">I'm a junkie for Eberly's books now.

Actually, I realized that one reason I've been writing less is that I've been flying less: I tend to write the tutorials while I'm on a plane. Anyway, I'm flying home for XMas, so I should be good for one more soon. :) 

But it'll be a while before we work up to the point where the material from the book will be relevant to the tutorials. Still, it has made me consider writing a tutorial on vector math. It's just so important. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1124"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1130</id><published>2003-12-14T06:31:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-12-14T06:31:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Swiss DevDays Slides and Demos Uploaded</title><content type="html">&lt;div class="Section1"&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         I’ve posted the slides and demos for my presentations at DevDays last week.         You can find them &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig/SwissDevDays2003Downloads.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.          Here are the descriptions:     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;         &lt;b&gt;Multithreaded Programming in the CLR:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Palatino Linotype&amp;quot;"&gt;The         CLR provides full multithreading capabilities to programmers of all languages. This         includes the ability to start threads, to stop them, and to safely communicate with         them. In this session, we discussed both how to begin asynchronous processing, and         how to safely share data between threads.&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Palatino Linotype&amp;quot;"&gt;Introduction to Managed DirectX:          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Palatino Linotype&amp;quot;"&gt;The DirectX library         has for years provided C++ developers with the ability to closely interact with sound,         video, input, and networking devices. The advent of Managed DirectX brings these same         technologies to the C#/VB.NET/other managed language developer. In this session, we         looked specifically at the basics of Managed Direct3D, Managed DirectSound, Managed         DirectInput, and Managed DirectPlay, with an emphasis on how these technologies could         be used in non-game applications.&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Palatino Linotype&amp;quot;"&gt;If you’ve been reading my &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig.DirectX/Direct3DTutorialIndex.html"&gt;Direct3D         Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll probably find the latter set of demos particularly interesting,         especially the Collider series of demos. It develops a simple but fairly realistic         non-game application that models particle interaction. Through a series of demos,         it evolves to use 3D graphics for display, 3D sound to report collisions, joystick         input for navigation, and finally DirectPlay for distributed rendering.&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;         &lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Palatino Linotype&amp;quot;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1131</id><published>2003-12-16T02:54:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-12-16T02:54:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Swiss DevDays Slides and Demos Uploaded</title><content type="html">Craig,
I found your on threading slides very interesting, but I noticed that you use the lock(typeof(Foo)) {} pattern.  There's an article on MSDN (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnaskdr/html/askgui06032003.asp) referred to by Rico Mariani (http://weblogs.asp.net/ricom/posts/41779.aspx) on why this is a bad idea.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The NSA is the organization tasked with (among other things) creating and breaking cryptographic codes. Supposedly, some of the best mathemeticians in the country work there.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But I think their responsibilities revolve around analyzing data, not going out and doing spy stuff. That would be the CIA's job. But even at the CIA, the stuff you see in the movies pretty much never happens.

Each come with their own set of characteristics or qualities.  If you’re a Mathematician then by all means go through the process of filling out an application over the web they just want number crunchers, however, if you want any other job at the NSA, know that your going to be recruited and tested without your knowledge and they will know of your desires to work for them way before you do.  They know talent when they see it and watch it closely.  In circumstances of this nature, they will recruit you into the organization from the outside.  Buyers beware though, accepting the position offered means divulging all of your personal life and energy trying to avoid snares from other countries.  Meanwhile your enduring a great amount of stress to avoid detection and keep up with the latest information from HQ.  Your constantly thinking outside the box especially if you’re an analysts or agent.  This can be highly stressful and only those capable of handling this stress adequately and professionally will eventually be hired.  Considere working for the government as working for a professional baseball club, you have little league, minors, and majors.  Each group of teams recruit their players and if your having a conversation about a professional baseball team with a stranger then perhaps it can mean one of two things: either the CIA is interested in your abilities or the NSA.  It's a highly stressful job and designed only for the most talented individuals in our country.  I wish anyone who is trying the best of luck..as for me I dont think I can handle the stress, therefore, I would be unable to work for either goverenment agency and I acccept that and try to help as much as a citizen eventhough I dont literally work there.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1133"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>46214</id><published>2007-02-26T14:56:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-02-26T14:56:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: So You Want to Work at the NSA? </title><content type="html">Yep.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Get their attention ... use your IMAGINATION and you will have a conversation with them perhaps without your knowledge.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Be leery though, you may be having a conversation with a cia agent not a nsa agent. Regardless, either organization would be great to work for.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In the last years CIA and NSA agents almost haven't done anyting else but so called "recon missions" Just gathering information about terrorist cells..etc. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;All the "action" is given to the US.Navy Seals
&lt;br /&gt;Who's intercepting and arresting the "bad guys". CIA has a great influence in the US.Air force and US.Marines. What they don't do is sending in their own agents to kill enemies. They rather send in US. forces and therefore giving all the credits to the US. military.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And for the record, if agencies like NSA or CIA is intressed in agents whos job is to risk their life, they will for sure contact you and not the other way.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;You may ask how in the name of god, do I know anything about this?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;My father died while he served a such agency.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Sure, that will not be a problem. As all of you may know, the jobs that you're applying to at their homepage, are mostly known as desk-jobs.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I've been reading some of the replies here, and it appears to me that you're seeking some kind of a action life.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;When my father was alive I always wanted to be like him, so I asked all kinds of questions. For instance, you need specialized combat training with the US.Navy Seals or Delta Squad, and several weeks with training in the so called penthouse. The penthouse is a training facility used by the CIA. (Usually or atleast some times, the US.Military is recomending special trained officers to the CIA.)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you're wondering why they haven't replied on your application(If you have used their homepage):
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;There are over thousands of people applying to the CIA/NSA, therefore have some patience. I am pretty sure that they will reply.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you're working for "the company"(CIA) you have alot of benefits. They pay for your phone and electricity bills, and even your funeral.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Got any questions? Do not hesitate to reply.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Like John said, if your going to apply through the channels of a webpage then your perhaps looking for a desk job, number crunching, crypto, or analyst position.  However, if you're looking for, as many of you have mentioned, positions of action then your going to get located and recruited by them.  As I've mentioned before, use your creativity and think outside of the box when attempting to be recruited in this manner.  They are generally looking for extremely talented people especially those who can speak many languages fluently, especially including slang.  If you use your imagination and a little creativity you can strike up a conversation with an individual with the cia or nsa, however, unless your very talented with both verbal and non-verbal communication techniques you may never be privy of the true validity of the conversation because it may sound something like a conversation about fishing for big game like sharks.  There are ways to get their attention besides going to their webpage that i feel more comfortable not mentioning over the web but Think Outside The Box that's what they want!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the reply John.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;You have all the right stuff education wise.  What nationality are you Korean, Chinese, Japanese, or some other Asian culture?  All I can say is think big picture much like your husband already has being a diplomat.  Begin by writing books of your own documenting your life experiences and exposure to different cultures.  I wouldn't write too much about your husband, as his position is relatively sensitive.  Being of the educational status you are, I'm sure you're exposed to people who have the appropriate connections to potentially launch your career in that direction.  There are a lot of people out there who would love to work for either the agency or nsa, however, they lack the credibility in areas such as travel and ability to speak other languages.  Their cultural background also has a lot to do with their potential of becoming a recruit.  You may be in a position of being recruited without your knowledge so be cautious and be attentive to all means of communication because you never know when you may strike up a conversation with someone with either organization.  If you find yourself in a conversation with someone they wont come right out and tell you who they work for as that information is very sensitive so educate yourself in ways that they can accomplish this without directly saying they work for either organization.  Regardless, if I were you and had the educational background you have, you can be of greater assistance to either agency by simply writing books about your cultural experiences for those people who are actually either in the organization or have already become recruits.  Consider yourself working for them already but you just don’t have the credentials, smile.  I hope this helps.

Well to put it simply they are the elite of elite the NFL and NBA of professional sports.  They not only remember everything but know why everything is why it is the way it is.  For example, they not only remember what people are wearing they also know what type of personality the person possesses based upon what they are wearing and they can also tell what type of mood the person is in at any particular moment simply by glancing.  They remember precise locations of virtually everything in their house and various buildings they enter like exits other forms of entry to say the least.  They can handle large amounts of pressure and can recite street names, stores passed, and time durations between each during a stroll down Market Street!  They also have an overwhelming amount of confidence and a highly competitive nature.  They are awesome and personally I could never aspire to that kind of level of proficiency.  That is why people like me call a spade a spade and bow out gracefully leaving the job to the professionals who also love what they are doing.  Eldrick, if you honestly want to get your foot in the door come to the states and become a security guard for the Secret Service with a post preferably in a government building in Washington, DC.  Perhaps then you can begin the process of establishing a reputation for yourself and potentially have a chance to work at the NSA or CIA.

You can go into the military but honestly if you call someone in either agency by Sir or Madam that’s means your green and you shouldn’t do that.  I'm not saying both agencies don’t hire military personnel but they are looking for smart, dedicated, loyal, honest, trustworthy people willing to be, like beenthe... said willing to be under a microscope 24/7 and under a lot of pressure.  Don't let the fact that you’re not going to be or presently in the military prevent you from pursuing your dreams.  Be smart and think outside of the box at all times.  There are people where you live who are more than willing to help you just, begin by doing some research.  Don't and I say don’t mention the name cia or nsa that’s a dead drop out for you.  Instead strike up a conversation with someone at a bar who comes up to you and talks about your existing job and mention how your interested in protecting whomever your in charge of with the highest regard.  Don't mention terrorism that’s not necessary.  They will know what you mean and they are trained to know your personality better than you know yourself.  Maintain a positive attitude and learn how to speak differently, meaning their language, and stay in the area you are in because there is alot of action where you currently are.  You never know they may hire you where you live because you’re familiar with that area and know the culture so you will fit in and that’s what they want.  Remember think outside the box and don’t think the military is your only option because it isn't.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;CIA also often sends agents with diplomatic immunity to foreign countries, in exchange for the diplomatic immunity the foreign countries demands that the CIA states why and what the intention with the deployment of the agent is.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;These agents are often recruited from the military. After the recruitment they are send to one or both of the following CIA training facilities;"The Poin"(Harvey Point) or "The Farm"(Camp Peary). There is atleast 1 or 2 years with traning at these facilities, depending on what kind of agent you're going to be.

do, how they operate, and how to start a career with either of them.

*important note to the canadian kid and filipino.... no you cannot
be in either of these organizations, you must be a US Citizen to work for the CIA or NSA. No, not "Permanent Resident" status or any type of visa.

First, neither of them are what you see in movies...not in the least.
What you think of as a "spy" is a CIA Officer, of the Clandestine Service, Directorate of Oporations... emphasis on "officer". An "agent" is a foreign person that has been recruited by a CIA officer to spy
on their own country (commit treason) and provide sensitive information
to the CIA/US government. An CIA clandestine officer's job is to Spot, Asses, and Recruit foreign nationals that have access to restricted information and get that "agent" to provide the CIA with sensitive information.

CIA officers main job is to socialize with people, groups, etc in order
to be able to spot, asses and recruit foriegn people who may have access to valuable information. A typical CIA officer has an official "cover" job, such as a worker in an embassy, and then on top of that, typically in the evenings, they pursue making those connections with valuable foreigners. Once an officer has recruited a couple foreign agents that are willing to steal information from their own government the typical day (nights) of a CIA officer involve a lot of driving around in cars while meeting with their agent, recieving documents etc etc. It is, overall, fiarly mundane work. The foriegn agent is the person commiting the crime (treason) and risking their ass by stealing this information. Therefore a CIA officer (what you think of as a spy) his main job is to protect that foreign asset (agent) from being discovered, mostly by being smart about surveilence detection. MANY MANY CIA officers have left the job because it is not like they hoped or expected. The best and most effective CIA officers are the most boring people in the room. Their job is to NOT stand out, NOT do the things in James Bond that will get you caught in 5 minutes. Of course there is the OCCASIONAL excitement, but that is only when things go wrong...you are being followed, your foreign asset (agent) is being followed, you have been spotted meeting with your agent etc. The last thing on earth that happens are gun fights between a CIA officer and foreign police/nationals, that would pretty much be the end of your career and the relations of the US and that country. The whole point of being a "spy" is to be completely unnoticed, normal, and not cause, create, be a part of any situation that would expose what you/CIA/US government is trying to do, which is convince nationals of that country to steal information in return for money, and give that sensitive information to us.

A normal CIA officer (spy), with "official cover" has diplomatic immunity, meaning that if caught, he can not be prosecuted with a crime and put in jail. If caught, the CIA will acknowledge you, and that you work for them. There are however some officers, in particularly difficult/risky situations or countries, that must have "non-official cover" in order to
effectively be able to recruit agents to give them information. Non-official cover means the officer would work in a normal job, doing all the functions of that job, so that the officer is even more "undercover", while at the same time trying to access sensitive information. A good example is the recent scandle involving Valerie Plame (look in wikipedia). She was an officer with NOC "non official cover" that had to work in a foreign corporation in order to get closer access to people/info about nuclear technology. A NOC officer has zero protection if caught, and the US government will not help you, admit they know you, etc. This is because of the highly illegal actions an officer with non official cover must do. Even so, and to sum up..... any clandestine officel (spy)
has a fairly un-exciting life compared to the movies....but it is still exciting in my opinion

There is a group in the CIA called the SOG (Special Operations Group) that perform special paramilitary operations. All SOG members are former DELTA, SEALS, Marines Force Recon, Army Special Forces, Green Barets, etc. They do the action stuff, however, they don't do any of the "spying" things. They are involved in the highly dificult and sensitive small scale military actions. 

So, what you see in Bond is basically an exagerated combination of a clandestine officer and a SOG member. There is no equivelent to Bond in real life...just parts of him in a few different positions.

As for joining the CIA as a Clandestine Officer (spy) yes you can apply online, and the guy that said something about if you are good enough the will come to you is BullSh*t..... that only really applys to those who will be SOG members and they are picked from the special forces. 

Basic qualifications to even be considered are a Bachelors degree that can be in many different areas, but also more important is language skills and PERSONALITY. Experience living in or traveling in different countries is important. I moved to Thailand when I was 19, alone, for 6 months, then Argentina and Colombia later. If you can show that you are highly adaptable, and can fairly easily assimilate into a culture that is the MOST IMPORTANT part. Because, essentially, that IS your job.
It is an all around package they want. And no, to the cafe guy that hopes to be approached randomly and receive a "mission"....not happenin' bud.

Now that I have written a book basically, I'll be short with the NSA.

They are a technical agency. period. 90 percent of them work in the US, and they do not go out and perform any "missions". Their job is purely technical, intercepting communications etc. You will not be in the "field".
There is no shooting, following people like in that Gene Hackman/Will smith movie. The FBI are the ones that do physical survielence inside the U.S. The NSA handles technical security in and out of the US, and the CIA has no authority to do anything at all inside the US...the CIA gives info to the FBI if there is a domestic issue.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1133"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>62054</id><published>2009-05-01T16:18:47.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-05-01T16:18:47.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: So You Want to Work at the NSA? </title><content type="html">ps- the guy suggesting you write books beforehand to get "noticed"

1. Any "well known" author can not and would not ever be able to have
a career as a CIA clandestine officer. You have already lost the singularly most important part of your job...being anonymous and unknown by the majority.

2. Again, the CIA is not something from the movies. You get a job with them (yes even the "spy" jobs) by submitting a resume (yes online) and thus starting the process.

Under Windows 2003 (and possibly other OSes – I haven’t checked), if you go to the properties for one of your local drives, you will see a tab labeled “Shadow Copies”.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you enable the feature, clicking on the Settings button will bring you to a dialog where you can set up a schedule. The basic idea here is that every day/week/month/whatever period you select, the operating system will take a snapshot of your hard drive. Only it’s a smart snapshot – it only records the deltas, making for a much smaller image than if I had simply copied the drive somewhere, and it lets you specify how much space the backups should be allowed to take up. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The way you access the drive is via the network redirector. So you simply open up (say) &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"&gt;\\localhost\c$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, right-click on any file, and pull up the properties. There’s a “Previous Versions” tab where you can view the state of the file or folder you’re interested in at that point in time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obviously, this doesn’t take the place of regular backups, but it sure is a nice safety net, especially when I’m on the road and don’t have access to backup. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One caveat: Dan warned me that there might be a performance penalty associated with enabling this feature. I’m not sure if I’ve noticed anything yet – my hard drive is a bit busy this morning, but I haven’t tracked down what the source of this is yet. It could be something else. At any rate, subjective performance certainly hasn’t suffered that much, if at all. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks Dan! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>1135</id><published>2003-12-20T07:18:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2003-12-20T07:18:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Holiday Surprise</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So we went to my biggest client's holiday party last night.

&lt;p&gt;Years ago, I saw a neat application that would show you your disk drive usage as a series of nested rectangles. This makes it very easy to identify which folder, which subfolders, and even which particular files are eating your harddrive. I completely forgot the name of the original application, but today I ran across one that does the same thing: &lt;a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/sequoiaview/"&gt;SequoiaView&lt;/a&gt;. It’s free, and it makes cool pictures like this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Dear PWSTM (People Way Smarter Than Me),  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;As I've gotten used to using my blog over the last year, I've been thinking more about managing my personal information. Lately, I've been pondering Wikis, a topic about which I know little more than the basics.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;On the one hand, I like the idea of a Wiki for storing notes and ideas. In theory, it makes it easy to maintain relationships amongst various nuggets of information.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;But in practice (the other hand), all the Wiki software I've seen has two drawbacks:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in"&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;It's presented as a set of web pages, which means (for me) using it sucks compared to something with a rich user interface, accelerator keys, etc. 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;The native storage mechanism is HTML. Meaning that there's no way to have typed information, in the sense that it would be difficult for a machine to determine that one page describes a C# class, and another page describes a Weblog entry. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;It seems to me that there's a sweet spot somewhere at the intersection of Wikis and XML. What I envision is an app that lets me specify a mapping between some piece of UI editing code (a form, generally), and an XML type. What I'd want is an app that lets me create new instances of those XML types, editing each one with the appropriate UI and then somehow linking them together, in the same way that a Wiki lets you link together HTML documents. If I could somehow get the version control that many Wikis offer, that would be really nice, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The advantage of this XML/Wiki hybrid is that it would lend itself very nicely to use for many purposes. Because of the reliance on XML rather than HTML as the fundamental thing that you're storing and editing, it would be fairly easy to have both a web and a rich interface for editing. Or a rich interface for editing, and a transform to produce static HTML read-only copies. And - done right - the mapping between XML types and UI that knows how to edit that type could make the whole thing pretty darn extensible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;As I've been running this idea through my head, I'm wondering if there's already something that does exactly what I want. A few things on my list of stuff that I don’t know enough about, but that might help or solve the problem, and that I really ought to look into: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in" class="MsoNormal"&gt;1)&lt;span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt; There's already some Wiki software out there that does exactly this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in" class="MsoNormal"&gt;2)&lt;span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt; InfoPath already does exactly this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in" class="MsoNormal"&gt;3)&lt;span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt; Some other app already does exactly this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in" class="MsoNormal"&gt;4)&lt;span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt; Somehow some app that uses RDF solves this problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in" class="MsoNormal"&gt;5)&lt;span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt; One of the above comes close, and could be made to do what I want with some tweaks to existing software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in" class="MsoNormal"&gt;6)&lt;span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt; I write my own when days finally have 26 hours.  &lt;/p&gt;

I've been trying it out, and I have to say I really like it. It's a desktop application that lets you build a series of linked documents in much the same way that a Wiki does on the web. To me, it's sort of like OneNote, except instead of pages and tabs and sections, you get hyperlinks, which is fundamentally more powerful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm definitely going to be shelling out for this one. I mean, it's only $12, and the last release was just last month, so I know it's still in active development). Of course there are things about it that I don't like. For example, while the keyboard shortcuts are plentiful, there are a few more I'd like to have. But I imagine the devs will be hearing from me about all the little nits I don't like. :) And the app is easily powerful enough to tackle the particular task I have in mind for it, which is to organize the hundred or so pages of notes I have for a role playing game I'm running. (&lt;a href="http://www.white-wolf.com/vampire.html"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;, if you must know.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, while it's nice that I have a tool that's good enough (and good), I still haven't found what I was originally looking for, which is the fusion of &lt;strong&gt;typed &lt;/strong&gt;information (i.e. XML), the Wiki build-by-accretion model, and a desktop (not web) application. WikiPad has two of those three, but it's still a collection of &lt;strong&gt;untyped &lt;/strong&gt;(i.e. text) information. Fortunately, the storage format - while not XML - is simple and textual, so if I need to parse it into something else, I can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, if anyone out there is interested in building something like an XMLWiki, give me a shout. While I don't have time to write the darn thing myself, I do have time to share my vision and to provide guidance to anyone that would like to tackle it as a side project. I think it's a fascinating subject, if for no other reason than that it involves figuring out the right balance between too little and too much structure. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1149</id><published>2004-01-05T04:49:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-01-05T04:49:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: WikidPad</title><content type="html">I'm working on something called WhaTBI (don't ask!), which I first mentioned in a post a couple of months back (http://blogs.geekdojo.net/pdbartlett/posts/357.aspx).

I don't think it's exactly what you're asking about, but as it is intended to be a generic framework with O/x mapping, where x is likely to be either an RDBMS or some XML source (file, web service, RSS feed, etc.) and presentation components, I could certainly imagine that your proposed app could easily be implemented with it.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1148"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1150</id><published>2004-01-06T15:38:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-01-06T15:38:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: WikidPad</title><content type="html">Interesting.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On December 13, when U.S. forces captured Saddam Hussein, President George W. Bush not only celebrated with his national security team, but also pulled out his pen and signed into law a bill that grants the FBI sweeping new powers. A White House spokesperson explained the curious timing of the signing - on a Saturday - as "the President signs bills seven days a week." But the last time Bush signed a bill into law on a Saturday happened more than a year ago - on a spending bill that the President needed to sign, to prevent shuttng down the federal government the following Monday.

That said, here are some personal highlights from 2003.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p style="margin-left:39.0pt;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;         &lt;span style="font-family:Symbol"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I         started this weblog. Here’s &lt;a href="http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog2/PermaLink.aspx?guid=4"&gt;my         first post&lt;/a&gt;. It was Radio at first, then BlogX, then dasBlog, each time vastly         improving on the experience. Hopefully there will be a bit less software churn this         year.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p style="margin-left:39.0pt;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;         &lt;span style="font-family:Symbol"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I         started &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig.DirectX/Direct3DTutorialIndex.html"&gt;my         Direct3D tutorial series&lt;/a&gt;. Fourteen articles later, it’s easily the most         popular thing on the website. It has been fun to get thank you emails from people         from around the world – it encourages me to keep going!     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p style="margin-left:39.0pt;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;         &lt;span style="font-family:Symbol"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I         wrote &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig/XmlSerializerSectionHandler.html"&gt;the         last configuration section handler I’ll ever need&lt;/a&gt;. This got a reasonable         amount of coverage in the blogosphere, and I still get emails about it from time to         time. Of course, these days, I tend to use &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/cmab.asp"&gt;the         CMAB&lt;/a&gt; for industrial-strength applications, &lt;a href="http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog2/PermaLink.aspx?guid=104b30ee-38d3-4648-bf48-20290a753a6e"&gt;despite&lt;/a&gt; my &lt;a href="http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog2/PermaLink.aspx?guid=654f61c7-9883-45c8-a87a-66f9802dee89"&gt;initial         misgivings&lt;/a&gt;.       &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p style="margin-left:39.0pt;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;         &lt;span style="font-family:Symbol"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I         shifted from doing mostly teaching to doing mostly consulting in 2003…and I’m         loving it. Not that there was anything wrong with teaching, but writing real code         for a living has been a blast – I’ve learned a lot about things I never         would have picked up while preparing to teach in a classroom setting.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p style="margin-left:39.0pt;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;         &lt;span style="font-family:Symbol"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I         got married. Twice. To the same woman both times – one ceremony in Hawaii in         March, one in Taiwan in September.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p style="margin-left:39.0pt;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;         &lt;span style="font-family:Symbol"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I         started a new gig at MSDN. At first &lt;a href="http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog2/PermaLink.aspx?guid=63670ab2-8166-4c20-bb03-8b72bfc41d24"&gt;I         couldn’t say much&lt;/a&gt;, but eventually the gag was &lt;a href="http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog2/PermaLink.aspx?guid=979234D1-2C4B-4E63-9AE7-12BB0A467ECE"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt;.         The first phase of the project completed, and I’m off of it right now, but I         hope to start up again soon. It’s a really interesting project working with &lt;a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/tewald/"&gt;Tim         Ewald&lt;/a&gt; and some other very smart people.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p style="margin-left:39.0pt;text-indent:-.25in"&gt;         &lt;span style="font-family:Symbol"&gt;·&lt;span style="font:7.0pt &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I         spent a few months on the &lt;a href="http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog2/ct.ashx?id=7bf8c86e-854b-4456-80ef-9b1653cf7595&amp;amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.develop.com%2fkbrown%2fbook%2fhtml%2flifestyle.html"&gt;no-admin         wagon&lt;/a&gt;. It was painful, but educational – I highly recommend trying it for         as long as you can manage. Of course, I’m off again now – the fact that         QuickBooks flat out refuses to run as a regular user was the brick that broke the         camel’s back. Still, the lessons remain with me.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1157</id><published>2004-01-07T10:51:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-01-07T10:51:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: The Year in Review</title><content type="html">If I were to start an award for "Worst Software Developers", I'm pretty sure that Intuit's dev team would take it, hands down.

comment on quickbooks/nonadmin: I came back to this post to see if you had found a solution. Seeing that you had given up, I almost did too. But I found that if I right clicked on my QB shortcut I could get in via the "Run As" option (Windows XP) and then sign in as the local computer admin rather than a user on my domain.

        I’ve been using the Beta of &lt;a href="http://www.newsgator.com/"&gt;NewsGator&lt;/a&gt; 2.0
        for a few weeks now, but today the NDA which kept me from talking about it expired.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        As usual, the software is rock solid and well thought out – clearly written
        by people that know how to make stuff that just works. But my favorite new feature
        is the subscriptions synchronization. Now, when I’m at work, I can subscribe
        to a new feed, and it’ll &lt;b&gt;also&lt;/b&gt; show up in my subscription list at home.
        Furthermore, if I read an item at work, it won’t be downloaded when I grab the
        news at home – I only get the new stuff. Very cool.

&lt;p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;i&gt;To get unification in physics, the primary tool has been the particle accelerator.  Maybe if we slam a SQL and VS box together at 99% of the speed of light, something interesting will happen.  What you learn from a supercollider is that things that are completely different (water and wood) are really made out of the same sub-atomic particles.&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0117167/2004/01/06.html#a543"&gt;Sean 'Early' Campbell &amp;amp; Scott 'Adopter' Swigart's Radio Weblog&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the analogy may contain the answer. You see, programming is chemistry, not physics. That is, it’s a fundamentally practical art, rather than a theoretical one. This is the reason that the OO designs of the 90s failed to scale – the OO physicists were smashing two hydrogen atoms together to make helium, but the rest of us wanted a car. It’s hard to make a car out of helium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is that we already know what the subatomic particles are: ones and zeros. There’s an excellent level of conceptual purity there. You can even talk about “atoms” like Streams, Tuples, and Unions – but you still have to do the chemistry to bake up a real system. The problem is that when you start to group those ones and zeros into the higher-order constructs that you need, you wind up with things that have fundamentally incompatible properties – transactions versus distribution, objects versus relational, oil versus water. So I’d have to say I’m with &lt;a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/12/31/HeWantsEverything"&gt;Tim Bray on this one&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

First of all, it         reinforced the wise decision I had made in listening to &lt;a href="http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/"&gt;Brad&lt;/a&gt; when         he advised that I buy an Antec case with the &lt;a href="http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog2/PermaLink.aspx?guid=9090a88d-dd58-4310-bb33-85cdc0b121b6"&gt;new         computer&lt;/a&gt; I got a while back; I always expect to spend two hours on even the simplest         of hardware tasks, but I had the thing mounted and running in about 20 minutes…love         it!     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         Anyway, the second drive on my goof-around machine means that Longhorn could finally         get installed. Yes, I know that I could run it in a VirtualPC instance, but the machine         isn’t particularly beefy, and I’m sort of impatient. Besides, the second         drive is going to be my new backup solution…having tried tapes and CDs for         years, I’ve come to realize that about the only mechanism that I like for periodic         backups is a plain ol’ “make sure it’s in more than one place on         disk” sort of arrangement.     &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;         It’s not like I need one more thing to play around with right now, but I’m         looking forward to checking out all the PDC bits nonetheless.     &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>1164</id><published>2004-01-12T08:44:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-01-12T08:44:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">EIF Woes</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So far, I've been quite happy with Microsoft's &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/productinfo/enterprise/eif/"&gt;Enterprise Instrumentation Framework&lt;/a&gt; (EIF). It takes a while to get used to the configuration schema, and there are a fair number of knobs and buttons to twist, but once you get the mental model right the design is actually fairly clean. All the problems I've encountered so far have been mine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now. I recently moved the project I was working on to a load-balanced machine, to test it in that environment. I had a problem, so I did what I usually do: fire up the log viewer I wrote against the EIF reader API to check out the log. And I saw no events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I thought it was configuration - that I might not have set up the remote machine properly. Nope - the trace service (I'm using the trace service they ship with the project as my event sink) wrote a file, and when I copied that file to my local machine, I was able to view it just fine. Next I thought it might be a bug in my viewer. Nope - the viewer they ship with the product has the same problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I whipped out &lt;a href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/"&gt;Reflector&lt;/a&gt; to decompile the EIF libraries to see if I could find the problem. Unfortunately, TraceLogReader.Read disappears into some native code that they wrote at some point, and the problem pretty much has to be in there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So basically, at this point, I'm thinking there's a bug in the EIF TraceLogReader.Read method around reading from logfiles on remote machines. Given that the product is supposed to support enterprise applications, this seems almost ludicrous. I'm hoping that I'm missing something - but it doesn't look like it. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1165</id><published>2004-01-12T13:17:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-01-12T13:17:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: EIF Woes</title><content type="html">Not sure about this one, but watch-out using EIF with services or other time-critical systems -- the initialization cost incurred with EventSource tracing is non-negligible!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/index.jsp"&gt;Ted Neward&lt;/a&gt; – a fellow DevelopMentor instructor – has taken &lt;a href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/index.jsp?date=20040113#1073993664414"&gt;a new job&lt;/a&gt;. He is the new editor in chief of &lt;a href="http://www.theserverside.net/"&gt;TheServerSide.net&lt;/a&gt; (RSS &lt;a href="http://www.theserverside.net/rss/tssdotnet-news.xml"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), a brand-new website that promises to focus on building enterprise applications in .NET. TheServerSide.net is operated by The Middleware Company, the same people that brought us TheServerSide.com, a well-known Java enterprise development website. Obviously, there’s an opportunity for a lot of synergy there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ted invited me and a few others to have a sneak peak at the website last night, and it looks pretty good! It’ll be a site for people to post .NET enterprise development news, but Ted’s going to be filtering everything to keep the quality high. In addition to news, they’re going to have streaming video interviews (the first with Don Box), discussion forums, and case studies. I find the last particularly interesting, because it seems like there’s a general shortage of “Here’s how you do this stuff in the real world” type information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re also soliciting articles for publication, and a &lt;a href="http://www.theserverside.net/articles/article.aspx?l=CalculatingLoad"&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.theserverside.net/articles/article.aspx?l=LargeScaleSystems"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt; on broad architectural principles of large-scale system design have been posted.

        I know I’ve posted about &lt;a href="http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram.html"&gt;Bruce
        Schneier’s CryptoGram newsletter&lt;/a&gt; before…but it’s just so good. &lt;a href="http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0401.html#1"&gt;Here’s&lt;/a&gt; another
        great article about what’s wrong with the color-coded threat levels (Yellow,
        Orange, etc.) that the US Government has been using. To sum up: they’re worthless.
        Much as I would like to blame this on President Bush, I’m not going to. His
        approval ratings and the tiny amount of public outcry over the massive sell-off of
        personal liberties for the (mostly false) perception of increased security point out
        that things like this are a consequence of a society-wide fear, not the actions of
        one man or one administration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        As usual, the only real antidote to fear is education, in this case about what security
        really means. In other words, if you haven’t already signed up for &lt;a href="http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram.html"&gt;Crypto-Gram&lt;/a&gt;,
        do!

Would my heart rate go way down? Way up? Would an EEG look really strange?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder for two reasons: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When programming, I often enter a weird state of super concentration, where I'm aware of little going on around me, and the code in front of me ceases to be a sequence of characters and takes on a much more abstract realization. I'm not claiming this as a unique experience - I think this is a common experience for many developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes when I'm writing code, I get really hot. I have a thermometer next to my desk, and the temperature rarely varies by more than one degree. So as a guy that's generally quite cold, getting warm is a sign that something is unusual. I haven't linked it to one particular activity yet (e.g. debugging, design, etc.), usually because I'm too distracted by being in state #1. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick Google didn't turn up anything on studies in this area, but I have to wonder if there's been some work done here. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1176</id><published>2004-01-18T07:46:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-01-18T07:46:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Physiology of Software Development</title><content type="html">Number 1 is called "the flow". It is pretty common among programmers. The worst working environments are exactly those that prevent you from getting into the flow.

I've never noticed number 2 myself. Is this before or after you punch your fist through the keyboard? :)

Anyway, if you google with keywords programming and "the flow", you'll get a few hits. E.g.: http://www.devx.com/devx/editorial/11659</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1175"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1177</id><published>2004-01-18T09:03:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-01-18T09:03:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Physiology of Software Development</title><content type="html">Another name for "the flow" is "the zone" - and its pretty common across many types of jobs - not just programmers.  It's an altered state of conciousness typically resulting from deep concentration.  People can achieve this through meditation as well, but you don't produce anything (ie code) when you meditate, so, what's the point.  Typically, your heart slows and blood to your extremities diminishes as well, forcing most blood to your brain.  Breathing slows as well - sometimes when I'm in "the zone" I snap out of it because I forget to breath (weird hey?).  When you are in the zone, time has no meaning. 

It's a good place to be.  Work places should be designed for people to get into and stay in the zone with little effort.  Minimize distractions (email, messenger, phone, google news, people) and you should be able to get into the zone.  People who live with distraction (Sales, PM's, Doctors, etc) never get a chance for exclusively introverted thought, and don't understand the zone.  

There has been books written on this - mostly about how older culters were able to harness the zone in practical every day life... which is cool.

As long as I was here, I paid a visit to the Microsoft Campus, specifically to building 5. I needed to sign some paperwork so I can get started working on the MSDN re-architecture again. I've been off the project for about six months, but now it's really spinning up again - the work we did before was only the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for you, dear reader? Well, since we're going to be doing a lot of cool stuff at MSDN, and since I have clearance to blog, you can expect to hear about it here. For example, MSDN is making the extremely bold move of implementing using pre-release versions Whidbey and Yukon. I've always admired this sort of “eat your own dogfood” philosophy, and now I actually get to be paid to play with the stuff.

One of the exciting pieces is that we're going to be using some really bleeding-edge stuff, like Yukon and Whidbey. So it was convenient for me to grab the interim builds of these products, since that's we're going to develop against. In fact, we expect to track the product teams pretty closely, updating our development environment frequently with new builds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, this is exciting for nerds like us. But like most things, it's a tradeoff; we knew that it was going to cause us some pain. This weekend I encountered the first pangs. In the middle of installing Yukon, I got an error message to the effect of “MDAC does not meet the Windows Logo requirements. It will not be installed.” Then the whole install rolled back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In and of itself, that doesn't sound too bad, but in the wake of it, neither the .NET 1.1 C# compiler nor any version of ASP.NET works on that machine. Joy. Hopefully we'll get it sorted out soon. In the meantime, I guess I can do command-line compiles of my side projects (more about those later) with the Whidbey C# compiler. Not the greatest setup, but enough to give me some confidence before I do a check-in. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>1186</id><published>2004-01-26T09:09:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-01-26T09:09:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Another Band on the Runtime</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was listening to &lt;a href="http://www.proggedrado.com"&gt;Progged Radio&lt;/a&gt; today.

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a song came on, and I had to laugh.

Well, I plan to explain in a bit more detail later, but this last week I wrote another Direct3D tutorial. It's about how to manually create a Direct3D Mesh, and you can find it &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig.DirectX/MeshCreationTutorial.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. As a bonus, I also briefly discuss z-bias and wireframe rendering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I've been writing these for just over a year - I published &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig.DirectX/GameLoopTutorial.html"&gt;my first one&lt;/a&gt; on January 20th, 2003. Since there are now 15 in the series, that means I've been doing better than one a month. On top of that, I also did a short &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig.DirectX/DirectSoundTutorialIndex.html"&gt;DirectSound tutorial series&lt;/a&gt;. Which, when I thought about it, surprised me: I felt like I've been slacking on these lately, but that rate is better than what you get from a regular magazine column. &lt;/p&gt;

The fundamental issue was that I had forgotten to install the Yukon test certificate before installing Yukon itself. Apparently, one of the pieces is signed with this, and the signature check fails during installation if the certificate hasn't been installed. So after re-running the install, everything appears to be working well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest mystery, though, is that all my .NET 1.1 stuff started working &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; I got Yukon running again. And I'm not sure what I did, although I suspect removing .NET 1.1 paths from the LIB environment variable might have been the key. Unfortunately, I wasn't very scientific in my desperate flailing. I'm just happy it works. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>1190</id><published>2004-01-29T04:04:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-01-29T04:04:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Anonymous Exception Catching</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was going through the &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com"&gt;FlexWiki &lt;/a&gt;code the other day, and I saw this block of code: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;catch&lt;/font&gt; (FormatException ex)&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    ex.ToString(); &lt;font color="#008000"&gt;// shut up compiler;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen this before: you know an exception is going to be thrown, and you also know that it's safe to ignore it. (You should think twice about doing this, but sometimes it's unavoidable.) And that annoying little call to ToString() winds up in there because otherwise the compiler pitches a warning about there being an unreferenced local variable. Although it's only a warning, and could in theory just be ignored, many build systems wisely compile their code with the warning level set to maxiumum, which would actually turn this into a compilation error. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code often gets written this way because developers don't realize that you can safely do this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;catch&lt;/font&gt; (FormatException)&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that there's no exception variable. This will compile just fine, and it does exactly the same thing the previous code does - silently throws the exception away. Only now we don't have that confusing extra line of code in there, and the compiler won't complain about unused variables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should point out that there actually &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; one case where you might want to leave that line of code in. If you want to be able to view the exception while debugging, it's convenient to have a variable to examine in the debugger. However, in that case, I would recommend using this code instead: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;catch&lt;/font&gt; (FormatException ex)&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    Debug.WriteLine(ex.ToString()); &lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has the advantage that under a Debug build, you can still set a breakpoint and examine the exception. However, because System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine is marked with the [Conditional(”Debug”)] attribute, it will not be compiled at all under a Release build - it'll be like that line of code isn't even there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a slick little bit of compiler magic that you can take advantage of in your own code to write functions that disappear from your Release builds. Check out the documentation on the Conditional attribute for more information. &lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1191</id><published>2004-01-29T14:26:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-01-29T14:26:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Anonymous Exception Catching</title><content type="html">I didn't know :)

&lt;p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Brian talks some more about the &lt;a href="http://www.urbanpotato.net/default.aspx/document/1745" title="http://www.urbanpotato.net/default.aspx/document/1745"&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;evolution of MVC&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and compares it to building a house... My $0.02, eventually computer programming will be as mature as physical construction, but we have a while... [&lt;a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/permalink.aspx/c1369f72-29e3-4333-b6ce-33970cf25d01" title="http://www.simplegeek.com/permalink.aspx/c1369f72-29e3-4333-b6ce-33970cf25d01"&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;simplegeek&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often see this analogy made: writing software should be more like building a house. You make a plan, you hand off the plan, someone else implements the plan…and voila! There are, however, a number of problems with this argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in"&gt;1)&lt;span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;It’s an analogy. It’s &lt;a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/index.html" title="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/index.html"&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;a common fallacy&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that analogies prove anything. A being like B in one respect (writing software is a constructive act) does not imply that A is like B in any other respect (separating duties between architects and contractors in software development is a good model). As humans, though, we love to pattern-match even when it’s completely inappropriate, therefore, analogies are one of our favorite tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in"&gt;2)&lt;span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;If you’ve been to my house, you know that quality does not necessarily arise from this particular arrangement. Crappy work is par for the course in many home construction jobs. And watch TLC for an hour or two and you're likely to see some home improvement show where the carpenter misunderstands the designer, and puts a window where a door should be. Or gets a blueprint that positions a hot tub over an unreinforced floor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in"&gt;3)&lt;span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;Writing software is not like building a house. It’s more like building a house factory: the program you write is actually a blueprint itself. The blueprint is executed by a computer to produce the artifact itself, i.e. the running instance of the program. This is unlike just about any other industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in"&gt;4)&lt;span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;Materials in software change on a more frequent basis than they do in construction. I don’t know what the Moore’s Law is for home construction, but I bet it’s not exponential on an 18 month basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all this is not to say that discipline is not needed. Obviously, it is. I’m just tired of seeing this particular, overdone analogy.

These guys are all heavy-hitters in the Managed DirectX space (Dave's book is now complete and should be published soon, and Tom is the guy that wrote all of the Managed DirectX libraries), so it was fun to sit down with them for a bit to chat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some time to kill after dinner before I had to be somewhere else, so I wandered over to Borders. While I was there, I picked up Tom's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0672325969/qid=1075997597//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i3_xgl14/002-2404028-2485622?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;n=507846"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; and started reading it. I haven't finished it yet, but so far, it's great. In fact, if I'd read this book before starting my Managed DirectX tutorials, I'm not sure I would have bothered - it does a great job of getting the reader up to speed quickly. Not that I'm going to stop now, mind you, but I still recommend that anyone interested in Managed DirectX check out Tom's book...and keep an eye out for his next one. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>1198</id><published>2004-02-06T06:58:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-02-06T06:58:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Here's Your Chance</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tmiller/"&gt;Tom Miller&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tmiller/archive/2004/02/05/68347.aspx"&gt;seeking feedback&lt;/a&gt; about Managed DirectX.

I particularly drooled over the constructs towards the end of the paper that allow you to - in one easy-to-read line of code - perform an operation on a stream of XML elements, returning a new stream of different elements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been doing a bunch of emacs hacking lately, and although my LISP was never good, it has become slightly less rusty. Xen reminds me a lot of LISP, only with a syntax that's a lot closer to what I'm used to, and that has better support for objects. &lt;/p&gt;

(Aside: a phrase which kind of annoyed me.  Possibly if I was as into science fiction books as Robert Martin apparently is I would understand the reference. Or maybe I'm not supposed to. It just seemed kind of pretentious. If he wants to write a sci fi novel, he should just do it... But I digress.)

After all the suspense building I was slightly surprised when the journeymen thought (to use the vernacular popular with football [the UK kind, where you move the ball with your foot] coaches over here) that "The boy done good."

My first thought when he moved from Jerry's clean, loosely coupled, highly portable text-based network protocol to a distributed object approach was that he'd walked straight into the classic trap: applying OO design techniques across a network boundary.  Almost always a mistake. I assumed the apprentice was about to get the public humiliation he so richly deserved. And yet he is lauded for binding both client and server to a Java serialization format.  Worse, if you go on to read the later episodes (which are at http://www.sdmagazine.com/columnists/martin/ by the way) he goes on to start sharing inheritance hierarchies across the remoting boundary.

I felt they had pretty much lost the plot at this point.

Basically, I've been writing a ton of code. Now that I've started at MSDN, my time during working hours is completely consumed. But outside of that, I have several projects that I'm working on, most notably my &lt;a href="http://explosionman.sourceforge.net"&gt;ExplosionMan&lt;/a&gt; game and a whole bunch of stuff on the &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; project. My FlexWiki efforts include, among other things, &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FwSync"&gt;FwSync&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FlexWikiPad"&gt;FlexWikiPad&lt;/a&gt;, which - if I ever get them done - should allow me to do all my wiki authoring and editing offline, synchronizing with the webserver only when I feel like it. This would be an enormous boon to the way I use wikis, as it often includes taking notes at a very rapid pace, something that a web browser interface pretty much sucks at because of all the extra mouse use required to navigate around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the end result is that I'm coding morning, noon, and night. Pretty much any time I'm not out running or home watching TV, I'm hacking on actual production code. That's a major difference from the days when I made most of my money teaching for DevelopMentor. Back then I'd still write a lot of code, but most of it was of the “Let's see how this particular feature works“ variety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting things to come out of the shift in the type of software I write has been my personal discovery of test-driven development. As an experiment, I started writing ExplosionMan that way, and soon found that I absolutely loved it. Like many others, the main thing that I discovered was that making changes to the code was no longer such a crapshoot: I could muck around with restructuring a piece of code, and the suite of tests I developed would give me a fair degree of confidence that I'd be able to quickly tell if I broke something. Of course, I'm still early in my experience with TDD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I've been loving the experience of writing “real“ software. I also expect - my attention span being what it is - that at some point I will feel the need to go back to a more researchy mode. What with all the Longhorn technologies coming up in the distant-but-not-too-distant future, I doubt there will be any shortage of cool stuff to learn when I get there.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been lucky enough to have that career option. Of course, it doesn't mean that I've forgotten what I know about COM, and sometimes that knowledge comes in handy. Other times, I'm reminded of how confusing that stuff has always been, and I'm even more grateful I could move on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take tonight. I was coding along, working on my implementation of &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FlexWikiPad"&gt;FlexWikiPad&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to pop up a dialog box so the user could choose a folder to store the wiki in. “No problem,” I thought, “I'll just use the built-in folder browser dialog.” Imagine my surprise when I ran the code and got a blank dialog. Oh, it had an OK and a Cancel button, but there was nothing but grey background where the folders on my computer should have been shown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did what any good debugger would do, and started stripping down the application, looking for the line of code that was causing the problem. But the application kept getting smaller, and soon it was just an empty form with a button on it. Clicking the button did nothing but open the dialog, and it &lt;strong&gt;still&lt;/strong&gt; had the same problem. I was mystified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a suspicion that something might have gone screwy in the project settings somewhere, so I fired up the project wizard, and I created a second project from scratch, with the intention of using &lt;a href="http://winmerge.sourceforge.net"&gt;WinMerge&lt;/a&gt; to diff the two project files. Only, when I was perusing the generated source code, I saw something that gave me pause. After thinking about it for a second, I went back and made a one-line change in my original program, and sure enough, it started working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem in this case springs from the fact that I tend not to rely on the VS.NET wizards. Rather, I either write my source files from scratch, or I generate them with &lt;a href="http://www.ericjsmith.net/codesmith"&gt;CodeSmith&lt;/a&gt; templates. So I had failed to mark my Main method with that little [STAThread] attribute, which, in the type of .NET programs that I usually write, is actually a good idea. But when you're dealing with controls that interop via COM - as is apparently the case with the folder browsing stuff - it just causes things to go &lt;em&gt;kerbluey&lt;/em&gt; in odd ways. &lt;/p&gt;

I completely agree with what he says, and the only qualification that I would make, I suspect he would agree with. I would add that, if you want to make free software as a &lt;em&gt;hobby&lt;/em&gt;, there is nothing wrong with that. Many programmers enjoy what they do so much that doing it on evenings and weekends is actually appealing. It's no way to make a living, but speaking for myself, I know it makes me feel good for a bunch of reasons: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use a lot of open source stuff, and giving back to the community seems like a conscientious thing to do. 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I get a tool that works just the way I want it to, and other people get use of it too. 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For stuff I was going to write anyway, the potential benefit of having other people improve is nice. 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Putting your work out there where other people can see it is scary the way getting on stage to sing is scary: if you screw up, people know it. But it's also a good thing for the same reasons. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, for consultants like me, writing stuff that a bunch of people use can be a reasonable way of getting your name out in the community, and that can lead to business. No direct benefit, of course, but it's not a zero-output effort, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's safe to say that Clemens understands all that. After all, his name is closely associated with the open source project DasBlog, and there are probably a few people that know him only through that product. So, Aiden, wherever you are, don't give up on open source - Clemens was just saying it's not a good career path. It's still a ton of fun. :) &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1226</id><published>2004-02-27T08:21:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-02-27T08:21:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Clemens on Open Source</title><content type="html">Yes, I do agree with that.

Finally: dasBlog is BSD licensed. So it's really free. No strings attached.

They were concerned that it seemed to advocate throwing away all the careful architectural design work we've been taught is a good thing, in favor of just attacking the problem piecemeal. Here was my response: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I'm not an XP expert. I haven't read the XP literature. My only qualification to say anything about it is that I've been using it for a few months, and have noticed a difference in my satisfaction with the code I produce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, you have to ask yourself if you've been successful with your architecture-driven approach. If the answer is "yes", then why are you considering changing things? I find that XP's main feature seems to be "ruthless practicality", so if you've already got something that works, go with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, architecture is basically a set of pictures (and a lot of thinking) that you draw for guidance before you start coding. Nothing about that is incompatible with TDD. Get an idea of how you want to do something, then write the tests that assert that your design does it, then write the code that makes the tests pass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways I've started to think about tests is as a way of expressing requirements. What I particularly like about that is that I'm expressing them in a highly precise, machine-readable, unambiguous language with which I am already familiar...C#. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing to consider: designs done in the abstract are typically at a higher level than the API level. Or if they are at the API level, they rarely express pre- and post-conditions. Tests do both, so they really magnify your design documentation, bringing it to a lower level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it's true that traditional architecture and TDD tend to emphasize different things. Most people wind up doing architectures that attempt to abstract all the functionality you *might* need. TDD takes a more just-in-time approach, focusing on only writing the functionality you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*actually* need, *right now*. Of course, test-first can be done even for highly abstract requirements, and designs can be written to a set of practical requirements - so those facets are orthogonal. It's just that they tend not to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both approaches have their place. I just find that I so rarely know exactly what my requirements before I start, that it's difficult to start with an abstract vision. A set of tests is also a set of use cases, and expressing them so formally (i.e. as C# code) allows me to work out details at the level I care about: the API design. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1228</id><published>2004-03-03T08:00:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-03-03T08:00:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: TDD vs Architecture</title><content type="html">I agree with what you are saying.  I find that an architecture driven approach is mainly useful for conveying things at a high level to other team or organization members.

TDD has been what I've tried to shoot for because it makes me feel safer.  (Did I actually just type that? Bump my dork rating up by 20, please.)  The problems I've run into in trying to implement it in my own work so far are two, namely:

1 - Time constraints force me to push my testing code aside, instead relying on "sanity check" type tests, and putting more burden on our QA department.

This feeds into

2 - When a defect does happen, I write some test/debug code around it to make sure it can be more easily identified the next time it happens.  Unfortunatly this is kind of a "closing the barn door after the horse got out" approach.

And I'm not just talking about compiler errors or crashes at runtime, but all the times when your unit test fails and you're like, "But that should totally work!"

Since I find TDD to be such an enormous benefit to my own personal software development experience, I thought I'd share how I got going in hopes that it will help someone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out to be pretty simple from a technology standpoint. In fact, you don't really need any tools above and beyond what you already have, as TDD is a process and not a technology. That said, I've found that &lt;a href="http://nunit.sourceforge.net"&gt;NUnit&lt;/a&gt; is a pretty handy thing to have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read in &lt;a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/writeUps/TestDrivenDevelopment"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html"&gt;sorts&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/listArticles?key=topic&amp;amp;topic=Test%20Driven%20Development"&gt;places&lt;/a&gt; about the general process of TDD, so I'll just summarize: you don't write any code without writing a test for it first. Yes, that means the test won't compile when you first write it. That's okay: think of it as a design document for what you want your code to do. Once you have the test calling the API the way you want it to, you can get the code written to the point where the code (and the test) compiles, and from there, to the point where the test succeeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing about TDD: it's all about discipline. There's nothing stopping you from falling off the wagon and writing some code without writing a test first. None of the tools will stop you: NUnit won't care, the compiler won't care, no one except &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; will care. And the rest of your team if they've bought into TDD. Even running code-coverage tests during your build won't ensure that you wrote the tests &lt;strong&gt;before &lt;/strong&gt;you wrote the code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, it's up to you to ensure that you follow the steps: write the test, then write the code. The thing is, after a while, it gets a lot easier because you start to see the benefits. You still get tempted, “Eh, I'm not changing much,” so it's still about discipline, but discipline is easier in the face of the tangible rewards. Here are some of the benefits I've experienced: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher code quality&lt;/strong&gt;. Obviously, testing helps ensure what I'm writing works the way I want it to. But one of the things I didn't see coming when I started doing TDD was that by writing code that &lt;em&gt;uses&lt;/em&gt; the code I'm working on first, I tend to get the API more right on the first try. Because a test is also a use-case. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier to remember what I was doing.&lt;/strong&gt; When I leave a project and then come back to it later, I find TDD makes it easier to remember what I was working on, because it's almost always in one of the following well-defined states:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not compiling&lt;/em&gt;. I was working on either writing a unit test or had finished a test for code I hadn't written yet. In either case, the compiler tells me what I need to do. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compiling but test is failing.&lt;/em&gt; I haven't finished writing the method for the failing unit test. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compiling with working unit tests&lt;/em&gt;. I had finished the feature I was working on last, and am ready to move on to the next. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier to make changes with confidence&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a huge one. When I change something, I already have lots of tests that ensure that what I changed doesn't break the code. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrates into the build&lt;/strong&gt;. If you use NUnit, it's easy to integrate into the nightly/hourly/whatever build, so when you forget to check in some configuration file, the unit tests will fail and you'll catch the problem right away. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Often results in better design&lt;/strong&gt;. You've probably experienced the phenomenon that when you have two pieces of code that call your code, the demands of the second caller cause you to refactor in a way that improves your design. Well, the test is your first caller, and the working program you're actually writing is the second. So you &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; with two callers, and you have to think about the API design that much sooner...usually with good effect. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the best way to get started is just to get started. You'll probably convince yourself that it's a good idea the first time you find a bug you wouldn't have otherwise, or come to a design realization that would have taken a lot longer in the absence of a good test suite. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1234</id><published>2004-03-04T11:38:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-03-04T11:38:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Getting Started With TDD</title><content type="html">http://michaelteper.com/archive/2004/03/04/147.aspx</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1233"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1235</id><published>2004-03-09T12:22:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-03-09T12:22:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Getting Started With TDD</title><content type="html">Two books I would highly recommend on TDD

The first is about refactoring (duh!) but he has a chapter on TDD and JUnit, the second takes you through the process of bootstrapping a project with TDD and then through the process of writing a Unit test tool. The tool is written in Python for Python and the example is compelling.

I've gotten far enough now on &lt;a href="http://explosionman.sourceforge.net"&gt;my game&lt;/a&gt; to have run into a few issues, so it seemed like a good time to share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental problem with TDD is that certain things are hard to test. Tests are easy to write when you're working with code that's designed to be called by you in some particular order - some sort of library. However, tests are much harder to write for certain mixtures of code that's written by you and called by you, code not written by you but is called by you, code not written by you that calls you, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic example of this is a Windows Form. A typical scenario here is that someone clicks the Open File menu item, which your code reacts to by popping up a dialog box asking for a file name, and then goes off and opens that file. It's a (fairly) complex interaction between code that you wrote and code that you didn't, calling back and forth between each other. Plus, we throw in interaction with the user. Similarly, in a game, we have users providing input via a keyboard or a joystick, to which our code reacts by rendering pixels onto a screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, to get automatability and repeatability, you don't want to have to require users to give input during a test. Particularly in a game, where a difference in user input as small as a microsecond could change the code path through the game. So a common approach is to separate out the pieces that you control from the pieces you don't, but abstracting them through an interface. When testing the application, you hand it an implementation of the interface that pretends to pop up a dialog box (or whatever), but actually always returns the same value. When running the application “for real”, you hand it an implementation of the interface that &lt;strong&gt;actually&lt;/strong&gt; pops the dialog box (or whatever). These fake test-time objects are often called “mock objects”, and you can read more about them &lt;a href="https://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/TheHumbleDialogBox.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with using mock objects is that - although you try to get close to the same behavior - you (obviously) never quite make it. You're testing most of the code you'll be running in production with, but not all of it. I wanted to avoid this problem with my game, so I figured, “Well, I'll just run the tests against the real Direct3D objects.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, everything was great. I was able to write tests that created windows, drove input (from a script, not from the keyboard) and asserted correct behavior. It meant that the unit tests would pop up windows while they were running, but it was sort of funny to watch the game play at like ten times normal speed. But then I tried to integrate the tests into the build. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've set up &lt;a href="http://draconet.sourceforge.net"&gt;Draco.NET&lt;/a&gt; to do what's called Continuous Integration (CI). You can read about it &lt;a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but the basic idea is to build every time code is checked in. I've found it to be enormously useful for letting me know &lt;strong&gt;immediately&lt;/strong&gt; when I've checked in non-working code, or code that breaks something someone else is working on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the problem: Draco.NET runs as a service. In a non-interactive window station. Which means that Direct3D refuses to initialize, just like it would if you somehow tried to fire up a game while a screensaver was running. So my unit tests were all failing, and as a result, the project refused to build. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had two choices. My preference was to figure out a way to get CI working with Direct3D. But after goofing around with it for a while, I realized that either I was going to have to set up the CI service to run as SYSTEM (to allow interation with the desktop) or I'd need to convert the CI system to run in a logged in session. Direct3D just needs to run in an interactive window station. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I use the build machine for other purposes, neither of those was attractive. I was going to wind up dealing with having to stay logged in all the time (and disabling the screensaver, too), or having random windows pop up and obscure my work from time to time. No thanks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am, back at the Mock Object stage. It looks like I'll need to create an IGraphicsDevice interface that will wrap up either a RealDevice or a MockDevice object. RealDevice will call all the Direct3D objects. MockDevice will just simulate those calls, allowing me to test my game logic. It's going to involve a performance hit, but I'm not sure how much of one - my game is 2D, fairly simple, and written in C#, so it probably doesn't matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well - at least I can reuse the objects elsewhere when I'm done. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1239</id><published>2004-03-10T18:26:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-03-10T18:26:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Extreme Game Programming</title><content type="html">Minor point: the screensaver shouldn't be a problem.

It's interesting to watch you going down the TDD/CI path, while at the same time I've got Brad Wilson and company at the Denver Pragmatic Practitioners inviting me to come to their shindigs in Denver.

A little off-topic question: do you use an UML tool in your projects?

I think UML is vaguely useful for communicating class structures that you already have and need tell someone else about, but frankly, any equivalent set of boxes and lines would serve as well. 

Basically, I find that UML emphasizes static aspects of code. By doing so, you wind up missing the important parts of how to build systems - the dynamic behaviors, the network traffic, and the interactions. 

Yes, UML supports these concepts via sequence diagrams and interaction diagrams. However, these are rarely the focus of UML-based designs or tools, and they really don't offer much advantage over a good ol' flowchart. 

All that said, I tend to work on distributed, scalable systems. There are lots of other types of programming in the world, and I can't speak to UML's applicability in those spaces. I also realize that I'm talking about UML as it tends to be used, and not as it would be used in a perfect world - but the high correlation between misguided OO purists cranking out nonfunctional or unmaintainable systems, and giant UML diagrams has left a bad taste in my mouth. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1241"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1249</id><published>2004-03-13T09:44:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-03-13T09:44:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Game Programming Tutorial</title><content type="html">[sorry for such a long comment on your blog, Craig]

By the sounds of it, I use UML more than Craig does. However, I strongly agree with Craig that "giant UML diagrams has left a bad taste in my mouth". I tend to use UML "as Sketch" (http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/UmlAsSketch.html). I don't believe in the practice of using UML as blueprint or as programming language (at least in the systems I develop at work). However, UML as blueprint I think is vital in systems that can't have ANY defects (like Pacemaker software, Hospital software, etc). The problem I see is that if you use UML to document, in detail, how a system works, there is a greater chance that your documentation will become out of date. Anytime you are making your documentation harder to keep up to date, you are doing something wrong.

I am also, unlike Craig, a BIG fan of patterns. Patterns are a beautiful thing. They give you a given architecture that can be used for problems that have already been solved. I think perhaps 80% of the time when developing software, the "problem" has already been solved by someone else out there. Why re-invent the wheel? Not only are patterns great for solved problems, they are also great for communication. When my development team gets together to talk about the architecture of a given system, it's great to be able to communicate at the architecture level (i.e. "Well, since we are basically just doing batch processing of messages here, let's use the Command pattern for our message handlers. But since the format of the input in the messages can change fairly readily, let's use the Strategy pattern to define our message content"). 

Oh, and for modeling, I use Visio 2003.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1241"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1250</id><published>2004-03-13T11:46:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-03-13T11:46:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Game Programming Tutorial</title><content type="html">Thanks for your answers.

I only use UML for class diagrams. By other hand, I'm also a big fan of patterns. I've got GoF's book and I'm thinking of buying Fowler's book on Refactoring. 

By other hand, what resources should I look about test driven development, extremme programming, patterns and refactoring? I have visited those I've found on Craig's posts, like www.agiledata.com and www.martinfowler.com. Is there another must-read resource?

I'm writing an MDI application (&lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FlexWikiPad"&gt;FlexWikiPad&lt;/a&gt;, if you're wondering), and I finally got around to implementing the feature that asks you to save your documents when you close the application. I figured it would be easy. And it was, ultimately, but it took a fair amount of experimentation and documentation-diving. So I figured I'd post the answer here, to benefit future Googlers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue I'm having comes out of the order in which messages are received. When you close an MDI child window, it gets a Closing message, which receives a CancelEventArgs argument. If you don't set the Cancel property to true, you'll later receive a Closed event as well. This is handy, because during the Closing event handler, you can pop up the classing “Would you like to save? Yes, No, or Cancel” dialog box, and cancel the close of the window if they choose the Cancel button. Then you can do any cleanup in the Closed event handler, which will only fire if the close is not canceled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has worked great for me for dealing with situations where a user explicitly closes each individual child window. The problem arises when they close the parent application. When they do this, I get Closing events on all of the open child forms &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the Closing event of the main application fires. Then all the children forms get individual { Closing, Closed } event pairs. So if I have two children open, the sequence goes something like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;child1 Closing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;child2 Closing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parent Closing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;child2 Closed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;child2 Closed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parent Closed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which pretty much sucks for me, because it means I don't know what to do when closing the app. If the parent's Closing method would only fire first, then I could set a flag somewhere that would say “Hey, we're in the middle of closing.” But because I don't know whether the first child1 Closing event is because of a user explicitly closed the child, or because someone did a File-&amp;gt;Exit, I'm stuck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“OK,” you're thinking, “Why not just choose not to prompt in the child Closed event?” Well, the issue here is, it's too late. The form has already closed. I want them to be able to pick Cancel and stop the application from shutting down if they realize halfway through that they've made a mistake. And I can't really just record what they chose in the &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; child Closing, because at the time the event first, I don't know if it's related to the application shutting down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the answer appears in the documentation for the Form.Closing event. It turns out that if a child cancels their own close, the CancelEventArgs.Cancel that gets passed in to the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;parent's&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Closing event will be set to true. If you keep it set to true, the application close will cancel, and you'll be all set. If you decide you want to force a shutdown, just flip it back to true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if your File-&amp;gt;Exit handler uses Application.Exit instead of this.Close(), none of these events will fire, and you'll be screwed. Don't do that. :) &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1253</id><published>2004-03-12T13:47:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-03-12T13:47:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Dealing with Exit in an MDI App</title><content type="html">For future Googlers (and Craig), the FileDocument class in Genghis [1] handles these details.

&lt;p&gt;If you say, “Microsoft wants to lock us in to their proprietary protocols so they can rule the world,” the thought going through my head is, “OK, you drank the &lt;em&gt;other &lt;/em&gt;team's Kool-Aid. I'm going to disregard what you say from here on in.” Even though I think the sentiment is probably correct at some level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you say, “&lt;strong&gt;Companies like &lt;/strong&gt;Microsoft want to lock us into their proprietary protocols so they can rule the world,” the thought that goes through my head is, “Yep.” &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>1255</id><published>2004-03-17T20:08:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-03-17T20:08:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Horrible, Horrible WebService Proxies</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[Update: Ivan helped me find a partial workaround. Details &lt;a href="/candera/weblog2/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6dce9025-d966-485b-b065-2b7d9988c633"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that my implementation of &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FwSync"&gt;FwSync&lt;/a&gt; (my tool for uploading/downloading files from a FlexWiki instance for offline editing) was a little slow sometimes. I figured it was because the web service interface is a little chatty - it requires a roundtrip for every file I'm submitting or retrieving. Boy, did I not know the half of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I whipped out a packet sniffer and took a look at what was going across the wire. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that every request to the webserver was turning into &lt;strong&gt;three &lt;/strong&gt;request-response network roundtrips. Ouch! A little more digging, and I found out that I was far from the first one to have this problem - it turns out to be a consequence of the fact that I have Integrated authentication turned on on the webserver, so I have to make one roundtrip to find out that authentication is required, another to get the challenge from the webserver, and a third to actually make an authenticated request. Because the autogenerated web service proxies (the ones you get when you say “Add Web Reference” don't hold on to connections, this process is repeated for every single method call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I didn't think this was so bad. That's because I knew there was a PreAuthenticate property on the proxy that supposedly told the proxy to send the credentials with the first request, rather than waiting for the “access denied” message to come back. I'd still have a second roundtrip for the challenge-response, but I figured I could optimize that away using the CredentialCache somehow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong! Oh so freaking wrong! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the autogenerated proxies are busted in a whole bunch of ways. &lt;a href="/jfland/default.aspx?date=2004-02-17#a401556a7-6bd7-497d-b5ef-e0d5d3a6134e"&gt;Jon Flanders&lt;/a&gt; set me straight on that count - there is no way to get the proxies to preauthenticate when using Integrated authentication. To even get it to work with Basic authentication, you have to follow the instructions &lt;a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106046/2002/10/24.html."&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;...but forget about Integrated. Lame! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone knows of an easy way to get this to work (without having to muck with the server, although I might do that too), I'd love to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This is actually winding up being a substantial problem for us, because it means that we wanted to have web services available anonymously, that you could pass authentication credentials to via HTTP Basic.  But since authentication is not *required*, IIS will never challenge for auth data.  That means that it's *impossible* for us to submit credentials.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;We may have to use SOAP Header authentication instead.

That's still true, but the wonderful &lt;a href="http://hestia.typepad.com/flatlander/"&gt;Ivan Towlson&lt;/a&gt; reminded me of a feature that is currently saving my bacon. He pointed out the UnsafeAuthenticatedConnectionSharing on the proxy that causes it to reuse the connection, saving a whole lotta roundtrips. It's “unsafe” because you need to be careful not to reuse the connection for another user against the same web service, as you might wind up providing the wrong credentials. In my case, that's not really a big deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love weblogging - it's sort of like a reverse Google. You put the query out there (after doing your homework, of course), and the results come to you. In return, you try to provide useful information once in a while. &lt;/p&gt;

I'm not sure what's up with "Remember Me". It doesn't work for me either. Fortunately IE's "intellisense" makes up for it, but that is annoying. 

To me, what's more annoying is the fact that my comment feed plain doesn't work. I don't know if that's because of an error in the source data or in the code, but it sure would be nice to get it going.

&amp;gt; How the heck do you unzip .zip files using the GZipStream?

For what there is so far in the framework, I don't think that's possible with any simple commands, except calling java equivalent perhaps.

Currently the options seem to be

a) use #ziplib if you do not require support for old pkzip archives (ones packed in DOS often years ago), this could probably be modified to use the Whidbey system.io.compression namespace, for what benefit - I am not sure.

b) interop with the InfoZip's implementation of ziplib (good support for older stuff)

c) few companies offer managed zip libs for a fee, these can be worse for old stuff than InfoZip - from what I've tested.

d) organicbit ziplib wrapper - also few problems with older zip archives, ziplib does not support those entirely

&lt;p&gt;I want you to know I'm leaving you. I'd love to use that old line, “It's not you, it's me,” but unfortunately, it's you. I just can't count on you. I can't even remember how many times I've asked you to check in, only to be disappointed. And you're a dawdler - I got tired of asking you a question, only to have to sit around and wait for the answer. To be even more blunt, you're not sophisticated enough - I have fairly refined tastes, and you simply don't seem interested in all the finer things that I need to lead a rich existence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you'll probably hear about it, I might as well tell you that I've met someone else. I don't want to mention any names, so I'll just refer to this other as “&lt;a href="http://www.sourceforge.net"&gt;SF&lt;/a&gt;”. Oh sure, SF isn't perfect, but we share a lot of the same interests, and we just have a lot easier time getting along. And yes, it's true, I've been visiting SF on the side for quite some time now, so this isn't just some fling. SF, frankly, is just a lot more mature than you are, and I need that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you're able to get over your problems. I'd like to see you succeed in life, if for no other reason than that a lot of my friends still hang out with you. All the best, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Craig&lt;/p&gt;

Besides, the CVS model means that if SF is down, I can go on with my life easily, since it doesn't suffer from the VSS model of source control. 

Like I said, it's not perfect. It just sucks less.

This is something that I should have done before my last post, of course, but better late than never. I sent them this email, which I'm posting here: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm not sure if you saw &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="/candera/weblog2/PermaLink.aspx?guid=4cc1d7f5-abe1-479f-9064-dee5f7a6f094"&gt;&lt;em&gt;my recent blog post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; about leaving GotDotNet for SourceForge, but after reading it, Chris Sells suggested that I get in touch with you about the specific complaints I have. It's a good idea, and only fair, so here goes. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;font color="#000000" face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I should be clear that I don't really have a problem with any of the other features - but I've been doing a lot of software development on GDN lately, and my frustration level reached the breaking point. To whit, I have three main complaints with the workspaces feature of GotDotNet: &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;font color="#000000" face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;em&gt;1) Reliability. I find that GDN frequently loses changes that I have checked in. I have to constantly diff a fresh download against what's on my hard drive to make sure I don't lose stuff. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;em&gt;2) Tooling. The tools are really not good. I have tried all five options for interacting with the source control system - web interface, web control, VS.NET integration, wksalone and wkssync - and they are all painful. None of them even comes close to the elegance and ease of use I can achieve using CVS and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TortoiseCVS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. On top of that, I find the enforcement of the VSS lock-on-checkout model very limiting, although I know that's a matter of personal taste. And I won't even start on the fact that there is no integration whatsoever with popular build tools such as NAnt or CruiseControl.NET - something I find to be crucial to doing distributed team development. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;em&gt;3) Performance. This is actually the least concern, especially if there are decent tools available. But GDN is slow, and that's annoying given the tools that are available. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;font color="#000000" face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In short, what I want GDN to be is a reliable source control provider with good tools. If, above and beyond that, it provided things like bug tracking, team websites, discussion boards, mailing lists, wikis, and the other bells and whistles that a distributed development project can use (and I know some of those things are available now), that would be icing on the cake. But stability and capability first. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;font color="#000000" face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I've posted this message on my weblog, to let people know that I was lame enough not to have written this email *before* posting my "Dear Dot" message. I would be more than happy to post any followup you provide. Just let me know. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;font color="#000000" face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please do let me know if there's anything I can do to help. I've left GDN for the projects I work on, but that doesn't mean I don't want it to succeed. I'm all for having lots of good options. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;font color="#000000" face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

One of the implications of this:

http://blogs.msdn.com/kcwalina/archive/2004/03/15/89860.aspx

is that generics will certainly be in the CLS in the long run, although Anders comments about 'in the Longhorn timeframe', which isn't too encouraging... This one:

http://blogs.msdn.com/branbray/archive/2003/11/19/51023.aspx

also says that they will be compliant at some point in the future, but again it's pretty vague.

So perhaps they won't be compliant in the Whidbey^H^H^H^H^H^H^H VS.NET 2005 timeframe. *sigh*

While cases like this one, templatizing the return type is fairly straightforward to deal with, there are still some factors that cry out for generic support to be added to the CLS: 

1) Teams are discouraged from exposing the APIs this way, since it means doing extra work. (Chris, I know laziness is a topic especially close to your heart.) 
2) I can't use generic types as parameters to anything nearly as easily as simply templatizing return type. Think about what it would mean to provide the same guarantees that "public T Foo(Blah&amp;lt; X &amp;gt; bx, Bar&amp;lt; Y &amp;gt; by) where X : IDisposable, new() {} " achieve in one line of code. There are a non-trivial number of assertions that need to be made, and now they're *run time* violations, not compiler violations. So I maybe have to define a bunch of exceptions, and my testing gets more complicated...

Using object as a type is, of course, the ultimate workaround, but it's going to be *at least* twice the work compared to providing a generic-only interface. Or an object-only interface. They're simply different animals.

That said, I certainly understand that adding generics to the CLS is a huge deal, given the impact on basically every language. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1298"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1303</id><published>2004-03-31T09:41:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-03-31T09:41:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Where Has Craig Been? </title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Most of these places, DevelopMentor sent me: &lt;/p&gt;

My EE background generally seems to have adequately prepared me to write software, as most of what you need to know, you don't learn in CS classes. Still, I do occasionally think about how it would be interesting to go back and take some classes, to learn some of the more formal stuff, like algorithms and data structures. Usually that's when I just go pick up a book on the topic and read it, to much the same effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you don't have to buy a book, though. Today I was reading &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dv_vstechart/html/datastructures_guide.asp"&gt;this series&lt;/a&gt; (particularly, the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dv_vstechart/html/datastructures_guide6.asp"&gt;latest entry&lt;/a&gt;), and I really liked it. Choosing an appropriate data structure is an extremely common task in programming, and it's not always simple. For example, in just the last six months, I've had to deal particularly with how to represent directed graphs efficiently, and having read this beforehand would have been helpful. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1309</id><published>2004-04-11T08:27:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-04-11T08:27:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Good Article Series</title><content type="html">Brilliant series, having a pure mathematics degree I've relied on books and the internet for most of my computer science learning since graduating.

"Fallacy 10: You teach people how to program by showing them how to write programs".

Glass notes that in programming courses and books, all focus is on how to write code, not how to read it.  He also notes that when learning any other language (including our native one), we first learn how to read it, then afterwards comes the writing.

I think this does make a lot of sense, in fact we've just started working on new project here at Numerica, which involves making modifications to a two year old product written by another company.  The first thing my manager said this morning was "how on earth do you start figuring out how it all works?"  

I couldn't really answer, other than "well, I'll pick an area, and start picking through the relevant code, that'll lead me to need to understand supporting modules, and then I suppose I'll start picking through that code too, and so on ..."

If anyone knows of any good tips and techniques on how to best read someone elses code, I'd be very interested to see them.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1311"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1315</id><published>2004-04-13T04:40:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-04-13T04:40:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Hacknot</title><content type="html">What an interesting question. For me, it's always been a matter of finding the abstractions. Programming, after all, is a matter of constructing abstractions - otherwise we'd just type in ones and zeros. Unfortunately, most people suck at making good abstractions, so their code is hard to read. But you still need to try to figure out what they're representing. 

The main reason for this, of course, is to be able to figure out what you can ignore. For most of us, there's no way to hold more than a few things in your head at the same time, so the more of the code you can ignore, the better. Knowing what code you can ignore means figuring out where the interdependencies are. If module A has no interdependencies with module B, then you can ignore module B when looking at module A. 

Of course, this is mostly obvious to someone that writes code, and mostly meaningless to someone that doesn't, so I don't think it would help your boss at all. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1311"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1316</id><published>2004-04-12T09:23:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-04-12T09:23:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Beware GoogleBot</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I get notifications via email whenever anything changes on the &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; wiki. It's one of the coolest features of FlexWiki, IMO, because I like for notifications to arrive via email/RSS (they're the same to me because of &lt;a href="http://www.newsgator.com"&gt;NewsGator&lt;/a&gt;). Anyway, it's often my habit to review the changes that have been made to the wiki while going through my morning mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I saw something annoying. Somone had gone through and changed a massive number of pages on the wiki, including some of the pages that I'm responsible for maintaining. I went to the wiki and found that my pages had been rolled back to previous versions. It was the work of only a few seconds to restore them to their correct condition, but I was bothered that someone had changed it out of malice or out of ignorance. The more so since it looked like they'd done the same to dozens of other pages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was there, I noticed that &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dornstein/"&gt;David Ornstein&lt;/a&gt;, the spiritual leader of the FlexWiki effort, had made some changes to the site layout using his new and ultra-cool &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.WikiTalk"&gt;WikiTalk&lt;/a&gt; engine. Hoping that error and not vandalism was at the root of the problem, I threw a question out on the FlexWiki mailing list to see if perhaps that was the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too much later, &lt;a href="http://sapid.com/tommy/"&gt;Tommy Williams&lt;/a&gt;, another FlexWiki contributor and a really bright guy, came up with a theory. If he's right it's a doozy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tommy noticed that the IP address of the offender is owned by Google. So he figures that the GoogleBot came in and visited the “restore this page to a previous version” link that's on every page in the new layout (it used to be in a dropdown). And of course, we don't have any “hey Google, don't follow this link” magic on those pages. Although obviously we need some, even if that's not what happened in this particular case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take this as a warning. If you have any unprotected links to “delete” or “order” or “trigger webmaster's ejection seat” functionality on your webpages, and you're assuming that no human would mistakenly click on them, remember that not all visitors to your website are human. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>9</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1317</id><published>2004-04-12T10:19:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-04-12T10:19:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: </title><content type="html">Hmm..

Require the visitor to enter the text that is displayed in an image on the page.  You know what I'm talking about.  You can see this in action on many sites including network solutions, when trying to do a whois.  I guess that still doesn't change the fact that you still can't have a simple hyperlink - it's a bad idea anyway - but you can still have a relatively small form that posts by GET.  Or a simple javascript can pick up the entry before following the link without a form.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1316"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1326</id><published>2004-04-14T09:09:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-04-14T09:09:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Best Auction Ever</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My sister sent &lt;a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;amp;category=621&amp;amp;item=3716461982&amp;amp;rd=1"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; to me.

I became vaguely aware of something on the wall directly behind my monitor. After a few seconds, the small part of my brain that isn't devoted to what the computer is doing sent a bit of an alert: “Hey, that thing on the wall is moving.” The alert kicked up to Infrared Level 5 when I realized it was a two-and-a-half foot long snake! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife heard me exclaim something unprintable, and came down to find out what was up. We sort of stared at it for a while as it made its way slowly up the unfinished wall. Eventually, we figured out that the best thing was to just go ahead and grab it and let it go outside. I put on my work gloves and got ready to do the deed, but the closer I got to it, the slower I moved. A bit like &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A524242"&gt;Xeno's Paradox&lt;/a&gt;, really. Eventually, my wife got tired of waiting for me and took the gloves and grabbed it herself.

For future reference, all of the venomous snakes in your area are rattlers, with the the exception of the Coral snake, which is brightly marked with red, yellow, and black bands.

Still the gloves were probably a good idea, lots of snakes release a nasty smelling musk when you grab them.

We're fairly sure it was a black kingsnake, which is harmless. 

The gloves turned out to be a double-good idea, since it bit the glove when Alice grabbed it. It wouldn't have been more of a pinprick, but she might have dropped the snake or flung it at me or hurt it. :p </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1339"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1347</id><published>2004-04-21T05:33:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-04-21T05:33:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Snake! </title><content type="html">On further consultation, it was probably a rat snake. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1339"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>32815</id><published>2006-08-06T13:45:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-08-06T13:45:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Snake! </title><content type="html">i recently ran into the exact ordeal. i do believe i need to fill in the cracks in my basement. whats funny is that my snake looks very similar to yours, and i've been wondering what kind is it.  i had to atleast trap it so it was not roaming terrorizing my daughter and i. i was totally freaking out trying to sweep it down out of the corner of my basement wall, i could here my mother laughing on the cell phone lying on the floor. it's still down there under 3 paper bags and a crate filled with car maintenance products. all the men i know are too scared to lift the crate (they were literally panicky! it was so funny. i quess i have to go down there soon...</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1339"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>32826</id><published>2006-08-07T03:37:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-08-07T03:37:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Snake! </title><content type="html">Clearly, you need a pregnant Chinese woman to grab it for you: that's what worked for me. :)</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1339"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>42274</id><published>2006-11-19T19:53:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-11-19T19:53:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Snake! </title><content type="html">thats scary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It's just better in every way - from the fact that it will show you which process created which other processes to the fact that the column names actually &lt;strong&gt;mean&lt;/strong&gt; something. But today I found out how truly cool it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My machine was thrashing on something, the CPU at nearly 100%. When I fired up Process Explorer, I could see that it was the mysterious “System” process. If I'd been using Task Manager, that would have been pretty much all I could tell. But with Process Explorer, I was able to right-click, bring up properties, and see that one particular thread was the offender. Further, I was able to see the call stack for that thread. On top of &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, I was able to click a button to pull up details of the device driver that was using the CPU so heavily. &lt;/p&gt;

It's nothing that lots of people haven't already figured out, but it helped me see things more clearly, so I'm posting it here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were doing some design on some classes for the MSDN project I'm working on, and we were debating how to model a piece of content moving through the system. In the system we're working on, a &lt;em&gt;content set&lt;/em&gt; (our term for a page and any other associated files or metadata) flows from the content creator, through a publishing pipeline, and into a database. From there, it's rendered out to the MSDN website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that, when content is coming into the system, it starts life as a lump of XML. But when the content is being rendered, it starts life as a database record. Further, there are some properties of the content&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;set&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that are only present at render time, and some that are only present when the content is being loaded into the the database. We were torn whether to have something like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public class&lt;/font&gt; ContentSetBase { } &lt;br /&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public class&lt;/font&gt; DbContentSet : ContentSetBase {&lt;br /&gt;  public DbContentSet() { }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public class&lt;/font&gt; XmlContentSet : ContentSetBase {&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt; XmlContentSet() { }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public class&lt;/font&gt; ContentSetFactory {&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt; DbContentSet CreateContentSetFromDatabase(&lt;font color="#a52a2a"&gt;db args&lt;/font&gt;) {}&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt; XmlContentSet CreateContentSetFromXml(&lt;font color="#a52a2a"&gt;xml args&lt;/font&gt;) {} &lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or something like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public class&lt;/font&gt; ContentSetBase { } &lt;br /&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public class&lt;/font&gt; DbContentSet : ContentSetBase {&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt; DbContentSet(&lt;font color="#a52a2a"&gt;db args&lt;/font&gt;) { }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public class&lt;/font&gt; XmlContentSet : ContentSetBase {&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt; XmlContentSet(&lt;font color="#a52a2a"&gt;xml args&lt;/font&gt;) { }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debate was interesting. I was all for the second approach, since I didn't like mixing XML and Database goo in the same class - it just feels like bad separation of concerns. But there was that word...Factory...and it seemed like that's what it was, so it sort of made sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll admit, I'm not even remotely knowledgable about patterns, but the one I do have sort of a clue about is the factory pattern. You see it all over the place, and it's hugely useful. But here's the trick: it doesn't apply here. Why not? Because the calling code already &lt;strong&gt;knows &lt;/strong&gt;what type of object it wants. Our database loading code &lt;em&gt;always &lt;/em&gt;creates an XmlContentSet, and our web page code &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; creates a DbContentSet. The factory would only be really useful if we were doing something like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ContentSetBase cs = ContentSetFactory.Create(args);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and we didn't care whether we got back a DbContentSet or an XmlContentSet. In other words, an important part of the factory pattern is that &lt;em&gt;the factory makes the decision about what type of object to create&lt;/em&gt;. In the factory above, the caller was making the decision by calling one or the other method. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that's not to say that the code wouldn't have worked either way: it would have. But it makes more sense to me the second way, and realizing that rule is going to help me figure out in the future when a factory is appropriate, and when it isn't. And that's a useful trick to have in my pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and in case you were wondering, in the end we wound up doing something else entirely, after figuring out a bunch of other constraints. :) &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>9</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1359</id><published>2004-04-21T19:25:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-04-21T19:25:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Constructor or Factory</title><content type="html">Craig

You just gave a new jolt of life to this poor pattern-challenged soul.  All along in my 7+ years of programming I tended to use only the factory and singleton pattern heavily.  The way the glitterati of the IT world talk about patterns I felt like I would be relegated to some leper colony.  Fortunately I have found someone who is courageous enough to admit knowing not-so-much about it and who has been in the trenches much longer than I am.  Thanks for lighting a fire in my life :-)

VERY interesting post! I wrote some about my factory-"adventures" the other day here:
http://www.jnsk.se/weblog/posts/decadefactories.htm

Not that I know extremely much about patterns, but as I see it, a factory isn't *only* useful to hide the concrete type. For example, it's very useful for setting up complex types.

And talking about factories, I like the view Eric Evans presents in his book "Domain Driven Design" where he says that factories are for creating new entities, repositories are for getting entities back after having saved them to XML or a database for example. It's just another matter of separation of concern, creation versus "fetching".

Best Regards,
Jimmy

Whereas a constructor always allocates a single new object, a factory may decide to preallocate objects in blocks or pull objects from a pool. 

FYI, I believe that Joshua Bloch's "Effective Java" book discusses the pros/cons of factories and ctors. (Not sure, but it might be the first item in the book.)

If this is true, what benefit do DbContentSet and XmlContentSet get from inheriting from ContentSetBase especially if the calling code already knows what type of object it wants?  
The only suitable use I could possibly see is code reuse.  But inheritance for just code reuse shoves an unnecessary tight coupling between your classes.  Changes to the interface of the DbContentSet might propagate to the ContentSetBase which in turn propagates changes to the XmlContentSet.  Maybe you should look into using partial classes consolidating the similar code to just one file that both classes keep separate from the rest of their functionality.

Very impressive! :) 

A few comments on your comment: 

1) We ultimately went a different direction that involves a single ContentSet class for data storage and two completely separate "factories" that have no relationship to each other. 
2) Inheritance is a perfectly reasonable way to get code reuse. The fragile base class problem you're describing is generally only an issue when you don't control all the code - i.e. you're letting someone else derive from a base class you wrote, or you're deriving from a base class that someone else wrote. In this case, we're writing all the code. 
3) Using partial classes seems like a massive hack as - among other things - it requires that we keep the name of the class the same in both assemblies. That's pretty fragile.

You also know that although I think it's a cool project, I hate the fact that the source code is hosted at &lt;a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com"&gt;GotDotNet&lt;/a&gt;. Well, we're looking at doing something about that, but it's going to take a little longer than we hoped. So in the meantime, I've relocated all the pieces that I have control over to a SourceForge workspace called &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fwcontrib"&gt;fwcontrib&lt;/a&gt;. This includes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FlexWikiPad"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FlexWikiPad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A tool for writing wikis that live on your hard drive and don't require any web access. Great for organizing information and taking notes - sort of like OneNote, but uses FlexWiki syntax. I use it every single day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FwSync"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FwSync&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;A tool for automatically synchronizing a FlexWiki web site with a set of wiki files on your local hard drive. The synergy between this and FlexWikiPad is obvious, but even without FlexWikiPad this is handy if you want to do a bunch of wiki work offline. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FwDocGen"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FwDocGen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;A tool for generating a pile of wiki pages based on the XML comment files the C# compiler emits. Because FlexWiki has the cool ability to email you when pages on the wiki change, we're using this at one of my clients to set up a build process that maintain a wiki of code documentation that will notify you when something changes. This one still needs some work, but even as-is it's still fairly customizable. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FlexWikiEmacsMode"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FlexWikiEmacsMode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A simple emacs major mode for editing FlexWiki files. Can be used in conjunction with FwSync to work offline. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WikidPad2FlexWiki. A simple tool for converting the XML export of the very nice &lt;a href="http://www.jhorman.org/wikidPad/"&gt;WikidPad&lt;/a&gt; tool to FlexWiki syntax. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of these tools have been packaged for release yet, but they will be soon, and the source code is all there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to be working on the project to make all this stuff better over the coming months.

Vault allows the client to be configured in two main ways: using VSS style check-out/edit/check-in and CVS-style edit/merge/check-in.

Actually, that's a simplification - you can configure the separate options 'Require Check-out Before Check-in', 'Make Writable' and 'Always Request Exclusive Locks' separately. Most people just press the big buttons for VSS- or CVS-style, though.

The main issue with using the VaultPub server is that anyone wishing to contribute has to get a username and password from SourceGear.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1368"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1372</id><published>2004-05-06T10:28:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-05-06T10:28:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Announcing FwContrib</title><content type="html">Cool.

This may be an overkill question for a blog comment, but feel free to post a separate blog entry about this, if you want;

Why does everybody hate GotDotNet - I've almost been convinced to place a project there, and I couldn't really come up with any good reasons why not. I keep hearing that people don't like it, but not really why.

We already have a dedicated CVS server, but none of the other services...

It's simple but handy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often find that I want to have a ListBox full of some particular item - to be completely boring, let's say it's a list of Customer objects. We only want to display the customer's name, but it's handy to store the whole Customer object in the ListBox, rather than just the customer's name, because it saves us having to go through the trouble of looking up a Customer based on their name. And of course .NET completely supports this, since you can add any object you want to the ListBox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were to code up a simple implementation of Customer like this one: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;class&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt; Customer &lt;/font&gt;{ &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;private&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;string&lt;/font&gt; name; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;private&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;int&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; age; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt; Customer(&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;string&lt;/font&gt; name, &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;int&lt;/font&gt; age) {&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;this&lt;/font&gt;.name = name; &lt;br /&gt;    &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;this&lt;/font&gt;.age = age; &lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;string&lt;/font&gt; Name {&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;get&lt;/font&gt; { &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;return&lt;/font&gt; name; }&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;set&lt;/font&gt; { name = &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;value&lt;/font&gt;; }&lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;int&lt;/font&gt; Age {&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;get&lt;/font&gt; { &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;return&lt;/font&gt; age; }&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;set&lt;/font&gt; { age = &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;value&lt;/font&gt;; }&lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;and if you were to then shove a bunch of these into a ListBox, you might be a bit surprised to find the list box displays something like MyNamespace.Customer for every object - hardly what we want. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The reason for this is simple: when confronted with an object, the ListBox displays it by calling ToString on it. And the default implementation of ToString simply returns the name of the type. Not particularly useful in most situations, but what else could they do? &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Of course, this is simple to fix if we're the ones that own the Customer object. Simply adding an override of ToString that returns the name would do it. But what if someone else wrote the object and we don't have the source code? Or what if ToString returns something we don't like? I've run into this enough times that I've found the following trick worth including in my standard bag of tricks. I simply write a class that looks like this: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;class&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt; ListItemWrapper &lt;/font&gt;{ &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;private&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;string&lt;/font&gt; text; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;private&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;object&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; item; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt; ListItemWrapper(&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;string&lt;/font&gt; text, &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;object&lt;/font&gt; item) {&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;this&lt;/font&gt;.text = text; &lt;br /&gt;    &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;this&lt;/font&gt;.item = item; &lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;string&lt;/font&gt; Text {&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;get&lt;/font&gt; { &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;return&lt;/font&gt; text; }&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;set&lt;/font&gt; { text = &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;value&lt;/font&gt;; }&lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;object&lt;/font&gt; Item {&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;get&lt;/font&gt; { &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;return&lt;/font&gt; item; }&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;set&lt;/font&gt; { item = &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;value&lt;/font&gt;; }&lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;override &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;string &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;ToString() {&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;return&lt;/font&gt; text; &lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, when I want to store a Customer in a list, what I do is this instead: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;listBox1.Items.Add(&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;new&lt;/font&gt; ListItemWrapper(“Craig“, &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;new&lt;/font&gt; Customer(“Craig“, 32)));&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;Which allows me to have any arbitrary text associated with any arbitrary item. Because ToString is overridden to return the text we choose for each object, the ListBox will display what we want it to. And retrieving the item is as simple as casting to ListItemWrapper and then just accessing the Item property. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>13</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1379</id><published>2004-04-28T06:15:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-04-28T06:15:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: ListItemWrapper</title><content type="html">All I have to say:

Probably 90% of the time, that works very well. 

But here's a scenario where this approach really shines: the ability to include null values in the list to indicate, "I don't want to select anything." Since we can assign text to any value, it allows for (IMO) natural use of null, but still gives us a way to display it. 

Similarly for list boxes that contain mixes of different types - Customers and Managers. Allows you to display things like: 

Manager: Chris Sells
Customer: Ian Griffiths
Customer: Craig Andera

in the listbox. 

Again, these cases are rarer than the cases handled by DisplayMember, but something I've run into often enough to be useful. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1378"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1382</id><published>2004-04-28T13:03:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-04-28T13:03:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: ListItemWrapper</title><content type="html">I used the Tag property (inherited from Control) for a similar purpose.

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm not much of a physicist, but here's what I understood: superconductivity is an example of a quantum mechanical effect that exists on a macro scale. This is odd, because quantum effects generally only exist at a very small scale - by the time you get to bigger objects, quantum weirdness goes away. My (admittedly weak) understanding is that this is because the interactions between the tiny pieces sort of “average out” the quantum “smearing”. So, for example, you don't have to worry that I might teleport across the room while you're talking to me, the way you might if we were both electrons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the analogy. When I read that superconductivity was a macro-scale quantum effect, the thought that spang immediately to mind was “Wow, talk about a &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html"&gt;leaky abstraction&lt;/a&gt;!” In other words, here's yet another example of the fact that you can never hide all the details of what's going on. You always have to be able to strip back the model to get to a lower level...living in blissful ignorance is only a part-time luxury. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>1394</id><published>2004-05-06T04:45:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-05-06T04:45:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Analogies Are Like Busses</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I noticed that &lt;a href="http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/"&gt;Brad&lt;/a&gt; posted a &lt;a href="http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/archives/004131.shtml"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CoderToDeveloper.html"&gt;Joel's foreword&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/078214327X/ref=nosim/joelonsoftware"&gt;Mike's new book&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, he called out this paragraph: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s something weird about software development, some mystical quality, that makes all kinds of people think they know how to do it. I’ve worked at dotcom-type companies full of liberal arts majors with no software experience or training who nevertheless were convinced that they knew how to manage software teams and design user interfaces. This is weird, because nobody thinks they know how to remove a burst appendix, or rebuild a car engine, unless they actually know how to do it, but for some reason there are all these people floating around who think they know everything there is to know about software development. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Is this really true? I've said &lt;a href="/candera/weblog2/PermaLink.aspx?guid=9e9a2993-6826-4e86-b774-d0a2de41b1d6"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, people love compare our industry to others and say, “We should be more like that.” But I'd argue that - human nature being a constant - it's more likely that we simply don't &lt;strong&gt;see&lt;/strong&gt; the manifestations of stupidity in other professions. For example: how many of a doctor's patients are people that decided to stop taking their antibiotics because they felt better? Or how many mechanics fix cars that never should even have been driven to the shop? Ask a doctor/mechanic, and you'll probably hear tales of people that never should be allowed to touch a human body/automobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It's true that few people will try to remove their own appendix. But few developers will try to write their own TCP/IP stack. Which is to say, since analogies are inherently subjective, you can prove anything you want with them. Show me a quantitatve measure of task complexity, &lt;em&gt;then &lt;/em&gt;talk about how people approach software tasks differently...because I'm not convinced that they do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After all, no matter &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; field you're in, half of your collegues will be dumber than average. ;) &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1395</id><published>2004-05-06T08:29:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-05-06T08:29:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Analogies Are Like Busses</title><content type="html">He calls out two examples: managing and UI design. These two things are this way for a couple of reasons.

1. Every one likes being the alpha whatever. Some people more than others, but people like to think they can manage. "I may not be able to repair a man's broken ticker, but I can manage a group of people who can." kind of people.

2. UI design could be chalked up to: "I use these things every day, if we just copy known examples that people like, I can wear a UI design hat."

As task complexity increases you do get the rare few who stick around, the 'perseverers', who may be doomed to failure or might learn something along the way and be better for it.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1394"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1396</id><published>2004-05-06T10:25:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-05-06T10:25:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Analogies Are Like Busses</title><content type="html">So, I wasn't arguing that point. I agree that there are lots of people who think they can write software, but who really can't. In fact, I may be one of them - the insidious part of the problem is that even the clueless think they are clueful. 

Rather, if you read what I wrote, you'll see that I disagree with the statement that this phenomenon is specific to software. I don't think that's the case - without being able to provide any quantifiable proof, I'm willing to bet that it's a facet of human nature, and therefore endemic to all engineering efforts. 

But perhaps you were agreeing with me and I misread your comments. After all, another way to take what you wrote is, "Here are two things in computer science that get screwed up royally often because they appeal to certain aspects of human nature."

Right now our team is designing an e-commerce site from the ground up.

And as for human nature, most certainly. If there are two things we know how to do it's be a part of a group (leader/follower) or mimic our peers.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can delete autocomplete items in Office and IE by holding the mouse down on the item that's getting in the way while the autocomplete listbox is down (you can force it to drop down in an empty field by clicking that field a couple times if necessary) and pressing DEL.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm loving this feature - I just used it to delete some old addresses from my TO: autocomplete in Outlook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Occasionally, people that are looking to do the same thing will ask me for advice on what to do. My advice is always the same: talk to an accountant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, it's not that accountants are particularly necessary for doing things like keeping track of who paid you when: we actually do that ourselves. It's that the tax laws in this country are so unbelievably complex that you can't be an expert in your field and tax law too. Why are the tax laws so important? Because of two things: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picking the type of company to form (S Corporation, LLC, sole proprietorship, etc.) has a major impact on your tax liability. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figuring out what is an allowable deductible expense is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;. Getting it right can mean thousands of dollars a year in your pocket and/or your retirement accounts. Getting it wrong can mean an audit at best and jail time at worst. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An accountant is going to cost you, but they should always save you way, way more than you pay them. Talk to a few of them, though. One thing we found out was that there are as many approaches as there are accountants. This is something that is brought home to me by the fact that every time I ask our accountant what I think is a straightforward money question, he says, “Welllll...it depends,” and then goes on to explain what it depends on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is exactly the same answer I give to software architecture questions. :) &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>1406</id><published>2004-05-13T04:48:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-05-13T04:48:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Beware File.OpenWrite</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was working on putting some finishing touches on &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FwDocGen"&gt;FwDocGen&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, when I came across a subtle bug that took the help of &lt;a href="http://www.bearcanyon.com"&gt;Mike Woodring&lt;/a&gt; to figure out. FwDocGen is a fairly straightforward wrapper around an XSLT that takes in XML documentation and produces &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; pages that document the classes, namespaces, etc. in your project. The idea is to produce the equivalent of MSDN docs for your class library, but on a wiki instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Side note: FwDocGen is now &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fwcontrib"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; in a fairly usable form.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what I was seeing was that the last part of the documentation for a class would show up twice. That is, the docs would list all the methods, properties, etc., and then part of whatever came last would show up again: a little documentation fragment that was completely out of place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally my first instinct was that I had screwed up the transform and thrown in one too many &amp;lt;xsl:apply-templates /&amp;gt; calls. But everything checked out there, so I was stumped. I saw Mike was online, and since he's preternaturally smart, I pinged him. Within a few minutes, he had said the magic phrase that turned the light bulb on in my head. “Looks like a truncation problem,” he said. And it was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental issue was that I was doing something like the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FileStream fs = File.OpenWrite(path); &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is a very handy convenience method for opening a file for write access. Unfortunately, &lt;em&gt;as it says right in the docs&lt;/em&gt;, this is the equivalent of saying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;FileStream fs = FileStream(path, FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.None);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is most definitely &lt;strong&gt;not &lt;/strong&gt;the same thing. Why not? Because OpenOrCreate, when accessing an existing file, does not nuke out the contents that are already there. So if you have a file whose contents are &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABCDEFG&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and you do a File.OpenWrite() on it, and then write “123” into it, you get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;123DEFG&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;instead of just “123”. In other words, the file is not truncated on open. Which is probably not what you want. It certainly explained my problem, though. I'd changed the transform so some of the files were shorter, and when I re-ran the program, it wrote the shorter version over the top of the longer version, leaving the extra garbage at the end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fix was dead easy. I just swapped out File.OpenWrite for &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FileStream fs = FileStream(path, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.None);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which works perfectly well. Somewhat confusingly (although it's well-documented), Create still works if the file is already there. But it truncates the file. Thanks Mike! &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>9</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1407</id><published>2004-05-13T16:39:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-05-13T16:39:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Beware File.OpenWrite</title><content type="html">What you wanted to use was:

I have to say, I'm pretty happy with how the tool is coming along. Although it still has a few missing features, the bugs that are left are all ones I can ignore, and it's never yet lost any data for me. I've been using it pretty much every day for a few months now. It has completely replaced my use of OneNote, which I also really liked. I'm taking that as a sign that I must be on the right track. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, since I got the code to a good point, I went ahead and released &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=104906&amp;amp;package_id=112894&amp;amp;release_id=238532"&gt;version 0.90&lt;/a&gt;. Now I need to figure out what to work on next. One thing I miss is full-featured Find and Replace functionality - I definitely will be doing that soon, since I often find myself wanting it. But I can get the same effect with a command-line search of the underlying files, so I'm wondering if maybe I should add the other thing I really want to get in: configurability.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been saying for years that &lt;a href="http://www.intel.com/research/silicon/mooreslaw.htm"&gt;Moore's Law&lt;/a&gt; will end in the next two decades. The typical response I get to this assertion is, “Oh, they'll just move on to the next thing...quantuum computing, multi-core processors, optical, whatever.“ This is basically an assertion of faith against an argument of physics - a typically human response. Which is why I'm pretty sure the computing industry is going to get totally blindsided when suddenly things stop getting exponentially smaller/faster/cheaper. What's Microsoft's business model when you have to buy a computer that's five times as expensive as the one you own now in order to support the features they're working on? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key, of course, is to figure out a way to profit by announcing something that solves the problems while everyone else reels around in the smoke. My current best guess is “compiler technology,“ but that's another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that Intel may already be experiencing an early little speed bump on the way to the giant brick wall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The warning came first from a group of hobbyists that tests the speeds of computer chips. This year, the group discovered that Intel's newest microprocessor was running slower and hotter than its predecessor. What they had stumbled upon was a major threat to Intel's longstanding approach to dominating the semiconductor industry - relentlessly raising the clock speed of its chips. Then two weeks ago, Intel, the world's largest chip maker, publicly acknowledged that it had hit a "thermal wall" on its microprocessor line. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The programmers who knew their architectures and knew how to squeeze every ounce out of a piece of hardware, versus just anyone writing a major app. Granted that landscape has changed quite a bit, but I recall even a professor of mine in the early days of Java saying "It's slow now, but in a few years time, the processor and memory increases will make VM overhead obsolete."

So to agree with you Craig, compilers will need to get smarter to help those people who can't write x86 assembly get those corners cut on the architecture, you'll see more diversity in cooling solutions, or maybe we'll see something akin to PCI-Express letting us use our video cards as a math coprocessor.

It's going to be an interesting next couple of years.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1413"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1415</id><published>2004-05-19T09:51:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-05-19T09:51:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Moore of the Beginning of the End</title><content type="html">I agree that moores law can't continue forever, but I think it will still continue for quite some time.  Just look at two things that Intel already has at its disposal.  First, there's the low power Centrino core, that's re-architected to give them high performance on significantly less power, giving them more headroom on the heat problem.  As they've canceled their desktop lines and are using the Centrino/Dothan core for future processors, it's apparent that Intel is going this direction to address the thermal wall.

There's also the approach of dual cores.  Another easy win is to put 2 or 4 or 8 processors inside of a single chip.  Operating systems can leverage this immediately, as can multithreaded software, so some of the complexity will get pushed to the developer to write multi-threaded apps where something more single threaded might have worked fine in the past.

Also, keep in mind that Intel is agressively persuing optical computing.  Now you're not going to have a Pentium that's powered by a flashlight any time soon, but you're already seeing optical circutry being blended with electronics in the case of ultra high-speed networking, so this technology may mature in time to keep moores law going.  We may successfully lane change before we hit the electrons in silicon wall.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1413"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1416</id><published>2004-05-19T10:35:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-05-19T10:35:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Moore of the Beginning of the End</title><content type="html">There's no question that the exponential nature of computing power growth will continue for some time. I'm just saying that beyond that we have no idea. And even if multiple cores works, it only works for a while - once you have more cores than you have threads, you just idle some of them. 

On the optical front, how does that help avoid the fundamental limits imposed by physical laws? Let's say that it gets you another 10x in scaling/speed before quantum effects stop you in your tracks. That's only, what? Five years? Different wall, but still brick. 

My observation is that optimism of the "we've still got a lot of room left" variety is correct, but that we shouldn't let it blind us to the fact that it's still a good idea to plan past the end of Moore's law...unless you think computing power can become infinite, in which case you should be asking a whole *different* set of questions. :)  </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1413"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1417</id><published>2004-06-03T07:32:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-06-03T07:32:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Moore of the Beginning of the End</title><content type="html">

&lt;p&gt;What does it do? It lets you run XPath queries against files from the command line. I call it XPQ for XPath Query. So, for example, I can print the number of “foo” nodes in a doc by running: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   xpq count(//foo) doc.xml&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or I can print the value of every “bar” attribute in a document by running: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  xpq &lt;a&gt;//*/@bar&lt;/a&gt; doc.xml&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way it works is by taking advantage of the XPathNavigator.Evaluate method, which runs the supplied XPath expression and returns an object. The type of the object you get back depends on the expression you provide. If the XPath expression evaluates to a number, you get a double. If it evaluates to a string, you get a string. And if it evaluates to a identify more than one node in the document, you get an XPathNodeIterator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there are 999 tools out there that do all this and more, but I love that the framework lets you do so much with just a few lines of code. And this one covers about 90% of the cases where I just need to know something quick about an XML document. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>11</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1421</id><published>2004-05-25T13:30:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-05-25T13:30:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: XPQ</title><content type="html">What?

So it's no surprise that I love working at the command line. One thing that distinguishes a good command line application from a bad one is whether or not it lets you use wildcards. For example, being able to do: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  fooutil blah.txt *.cs abc????.xml&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is a good thing - it lets me say, “Run fooutil on the file blah.txt, any file with a .cs extension, and files that have a name that start with abc, are seven characters long, and have an xml extension” all in one fell swoop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;static&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;int&lt;/font&gt; Main(&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;string&lt;/font&gt;[] args) {&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;  foreach&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;string&lt;/font&gt; filespec &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;in&lt;/font&gt; args) {&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;    string&lt;/font&gt; specdir = &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#000080"&gt;Path&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.GetDirectoryName(filespec);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;    string&lt;/font&gt; specpart = &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#000080"&gt;Path&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.GetFileName(filespec);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font color="#008000"&gt;    // GetFiles will vomit on an empty specdir&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;    if&lt;/font&gt; (specdir.Length == 0) {&lt;br /&gt;      specdir = &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#000080"&gt;Environment&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.CurrentDirectory; &lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;    foreach&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;string&lt;/font&gt; file &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;in&lt;/font&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#000080"&gt;Directory&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.GetFiles(specdir, specpart)) {&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;      string&lt;/font&gt; path = &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#000080"&gt;Path&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.Combine(specdir, file);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font color="#008000"&gt;      // Your code to process the file identified by path goes here&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The key magic here is Directory.GetFiles, which will return you a string array of file names that match a given directory a pattern.

We drove up and got her settled in to her new, incredibly busy life. While she was listening to introductory speeches, I got some time to spend with my computer. I'd recently run into some issues with &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FwContrib"&gt;my offline FlexWiki editing tools&lt;/a&gt;, and finally needed the ability to merge offline and online changes. About eight hours of effort later, I've completed it. With this feature out of the way, I feel like I can finally slap a 1.0 label on &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FwSync"&gt;FwSync&lt;/a&gt;. Woohoo! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really a milestone for me. Like many people in my line of work, I have a fairly short attention span - I tend to focus on something intently for a while, figure out about 80% of it, and then move on to the next thing. That's an asset when you're teaching a class or researching a new technology, but I've long been aware that “real” developers don't have the luxury of moving on once the interesting bits are finished. So I've been looking at &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FwSync"&gt;FwSync&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FlexWikiPad"&gt;FlexWikiPad&lt;/a&gt; as ways to see if I can follow a project all the way through to the end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have a fair way to go in my journey. If nothing else, I'd like to ship version 1.0 of FlexWikiPad as well. And beyond that, I want to spend some time supporting the products, because I think you learn a lot by hearing how the choices you make screw other people over. You learn even more when you then have to fix them. :) &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>1435</id><published>2004-06-01T04:30:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-06-01T04:30:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">More Direct3D Afrikaans Translations</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

What API should I use?” He laughed, and then went on to explain how much the answer sucks. Basically, the only way to do it using the System.Xml APIs is to use the OuterXml property of the navigator to turn the XML back into a string, then suck it up into an XmlTextReader, then validate using that. This is a huge waste - it means you have to take &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;you already parsed&lt;/em&gt;, unparse it, then turn around and parse it again. Lame! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew I couldn't be the only one that had run into this problem before. Acting on a hunch, I ran a Google search on XPathNavigatorReader. Sure enough, I found &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2004/04/19/115966.aspx"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, which led me to &lt;a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mvp-xml"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. In brief, it is the exact adapter layer I wanted, allowing me to get an XmlReader over any XPathNavigator. What's great is that the package was released just two days ago, so my timing was fortuitous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a bunch of other cool stuff in there, too - definitely check it out if you're working with the System.Xml APIs at all..some of this stuff isn't even in Whidbey yet. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1437</id><published>2004-06-02T17:32:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-06-02T17:32:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: mvp-xml</title><content type="html">Some of the XML coolness in .Net is a bit convoluted.

Aaron joined the group lately, although in particular the XPathNavigatorReader is not based on his previous work. 
The project is pretty active, releasing a version every couple weeks, on average. The list of utilities on the project is here: http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2004/05/15/132532.aspx.

You may be interested in another common scenario solved by our project: how to avoid loading XmlDocuments just to return well-formed XML from a WebService. http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2004/05/31/144922.aspx. You can do it directly from an XPathNavigator or any XmlReader. :D

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So a guy goes to the doctor. The doctor asks, “What seems to be the problem?” The guy, obviously somewhat embarassed says, “Well, it's the strangest thing, but my, um, private parts seem to have turned bright orange.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The doctor is taken aback - he's never heard of anything like this before. He examines the man, and sure enough, the situation is exactly as the man describes it: as orange as a traffic cone. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Have there been any significant changes in your life that might explain this?” the doctor asks. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I don't think so. I mean, my wife left me last week, but nothing medical, if that's what you're asking.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Sometimes big changes like that can cause stress, and stress can have odd effects. Have you been feeling depressed, losing sleep, anything like that?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Not really - I've been taking it pretty easy. Mostly I just sit on the couch, eat cheese doodles, and watch porn.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was playing around with some software that needs a database back-end. All I have on my machine right now is some interim build of Yukon that we're using at &lt;a href="http://msdn.com/"&gt;MSDN&lt;/a&gt;. I knew I was risking problems by using it, but I didn't really want to have to install SQL Server 2000 as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem I ran into was when using a connection string like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;server=.\saratoga;database=MSDNPreview;uid=blah;pwd=foobar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was getting the following error message&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SQL Server does not exist or access denied.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After playing around with it for a while, I discovered that if I ran the program I was testing from a window where it bound to Whidbey, the error message went away. In other words, the problem only existed when using System.Data.SqlClient from the CLR 1.1. I thought I was running into a bug in Yukon that meant I was going to have to install SQL Server 2000. Sigh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, before I went down that road, I asked some of my DM buddies if they knew of this particular issue. Bob came back and said that he'd seen this error before, and that for him, switching the connection string to something like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;server=&lt;strong&gt;localhost&lt;/strong&gt;\saratoga;database=MSDNPreview;uid=blah;pwd=foobar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fixed the problem (note the use of 'localhost' instead of '.'). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sure enough - it fixed it for me, too.

I tried using "net=dbmsscp" (or whatever the syntax is - I looked it up) to force a TCP/IP connection, and still got the same error. So while specifying localhost may *also* have changed it to use TCP/IP, *nothing* was working with '.', so I didn't have much choice. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1445"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1448</id><published>2004-06-08T00:34:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-06-08T00:34:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: &amp;amp;quot;SQL Server does not exist or access denied&amp;amp;quot; in Yukon</title><content type="html">Just FYI, it looks like it's a MS bug (but their suggestion is that you try changing the connection library as well:

&lt;br /&gt;I've having the same trouble, the issue was, my Avast Server Edition has been expired, so it just block some protocols, in some few computers didn't connect using TCP/IP and also some others didn't connect using the PIPE Server name. Only by removing the Avast Antivirus from the server was the solution.

I like this because I get to hear about what they are trying to do, and because it gives me a chance to solve interesting problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently got a letter from John Wessel that I thought posed an interesting question, so (with his permission), I'm posting it here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;gt; First, your tutorials on DirectX are great. I enjoy reading them because&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; afterward I can actually make something work, and it validates my&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; existence.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;:) Glad you enjoyed them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; Second, my question is almost related. I'm eighteen, in junior college and&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; will be transferring in two or three semesters to a 4-year. I'm trying to&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; find out what the job market is and what people are looking for when they&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; hire. I figured I'd start by asking the people who got me interested in&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; programming in the first place, the legible tutorial writers! I'm not&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; quite sure exactly what you do or if you work for someone, but you seem&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; knowledgeable enough so I thought you might have a good perspective.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I'm an independent computer programming contractor. My wife and I run our&lt;br /&gt;own business, which is just the two of us. I used to teach for&lt;br /&gt;DevelopMentor, but these days I design and write systems for my clients. I&lt;br /&gt;bill myself as an expert in .NET technologies, with an emphasis on security&lt;br /&gt;and web services. Our website is &lt;/font&gt;&lt;a href="http://wangdera.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;http://wangdera.com&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; if you want to see a&lt;br /&gt;bit more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; What should I major in? Is computer science absolutely necessary, or would&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; something like physics, which I'm leaning towards right now, be&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; acceptable? I've taught myself how to program and I dread having to take&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; classes on something I'm decent at already. I'd rather learn something&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; more that I can apply through programming, but I'd like to have a job,&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; too.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Computer science is not necessary. It helps some, since your focus will be&lt;br /&gt;on computers, but frankly, there's not a ton of difference between one BS&lt;br /&gt;and another - most of your core courses are the same regardless of whether&lt;br /&gt;you're a physics major or a biology major or an electrical engineer (which&lt;br /&gt;is what I did). &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;See, here's the thing that no one tells you: learning to be a good computer&lt;br /&gt;programmer takes at least ten years. Which means that just about no one&lt;br /&gt;coming out of college is any good. The smart employers (and believe me,&lt;br /&gt;there are a lot of dumb ones) know this, and aren't really looking for&lt;br /&gt;people that already have really strong programming skills. They're looking&lt;br /&gt;for people with strong *thinking* skills, since those people can be taught&lt;br /&gt;to do just about anything well. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;You should major in whatever you're interested in. Five years from now, when&lt;br /&gt;you graduate, the job market and technologies in use will probably be pretty&lt;br /&gt;different from what they are now. Also - and I know this can hard to believe&lt;br /&gt;from your side of it - your brain is going to change a lot between now and&lt;br /&gt;age 22. It changes even more between 22 and 30. Everyone always thinks that&lt;br /&gt;you stop growing up at 18, but I can tell you that is sooooooo not true. &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the point is that it's too hard to guess with a lot of accuracy what&lt;br /&gt;a) the job market is going to be like in 2008, and b) what *you're* going to&lt;br /&gt;be like in 2008. Therefore, to make the most out of college, stay&lt;br /&gt;interested. If that means physics, do physics. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; What skills should I have in order to get hired? My ideal programming job&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; would be developing the next platform of blank, like .NET, DirectX or&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; something entirely new and different. To date I've gotten a few jobs&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; building some ASP.NET web applications, the major one being some&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; accounting software for the City of Elk Grove, but no other work&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; experience.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Well, one thing I'd point out is that for something like .NET or DirectX,&lt;br /&gt;there are a very small number of people building it, but a very large number&lt;br /&gt;of people using it. In other words, there's a lot more work out there&lt;br /&gt;building ASP.NET web applications than there is writing DirectX 10.0. For&lt;br /&gt;example, Managed DirectX 9 was written by one guy. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;This is sort of good news and bad news. The bad news is obvious - what you&lt;br /&gt;think is your ideal job is going to be very competitive to get. The good&lt;br /&gt;news is that all of that other work building "business" applications,&lt;br /&gt;actually turns out to be very interesting, and very lucrative. So don't&lt;br /&gt;write it off - there are hard problems to be solved in every field, and good&lt;br /&gt;programmers are needed to do the work. That said, *someone* has to write&lt;br /&gt;.NET 3.0, and it might just be you. :) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;My parting advice to you is that, regardless of what major you choose, be&lt;br /&gt;sure to keep programming. Remember - it takes at least ten years to get&lt;br /&gt;good. It sounds like you've already got a great start. (And you write well,&lt;br /&gt;too, which is also a really good sign.) But make sure you take what you've&lt;br /&gt;done already and keep building on it. Write code. Study design. Write more&lt;br /&gt;code. Even familiarize yourself with some of the non-technology aspects of&lt;br /&gt;programming like how team-based development works (e.g. pair programming,&lt;br /&gt;test-driven development, etc.) You're going to need to do all of this - a&lt;br /&gt;lot - before you can rightfully consider yourself an elite programmer. I&lt;br /&gt;know I'm still learning. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help, or questions I can&lt;br /&gt;answer. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I graduated with a BS and an MS in EE after five years. 

Over the summer, I was offered a job doing software work for a very EE-oriented company, and a contract position doing straight software in a business context. I took the contract position, which led me to where I am today. No regrets.

I started as a CS major at a land grant college and was bored with the cirriculum and found my only challenge was the higher level courses that were all abstraction and not any programming. I decided to do what Craig suggested and study what I wanted to study. I went the Anthropology route and ended up writing some simulation software to model cultures and educational programs for Anthropology, but now I'm writing code for web applications and .NET apps that focus on user interaction. How do people respond to this application, and why. So find what you want to do in the realm of programming, if you want to write computer related systems, stay in CS/Math, but if you want to write business apps (like Craig said, where the $$$ is) study business and people. If you want to write games, study art, design, and physics. Find what you want to do and mould your program to that underlying goal.

Odds are over time (took me six years) you'll find your niche, and even then you won't really be ready to stop finding new things to do.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1450"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1771</id><published>2004-07-30T10:13:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-30T10:13:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Advice For John</title><content type="html">Nice post.  But I will quibble slightly, otherwise what would be the point?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;a) Pursue your passions is absolutely dead on.  But it sounds like John's passion is programming and for him to think he has exhausted this at 18 seems, well, to suffer from the exhuberance of youth.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;b) Many CS majors place far to much emphasis on learning languages and platforms.  OTOH, any good CS degree will teach how to think about code.  I see so many people in the computing world who wouldn't know an effective loop if it wrapped itself around their neck.  Taking an Anthro degree won't teach the fundamentals of good code.  Nor are you likely to learn them without directed focus.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;c) 10 years?  Once you know how to think (very good point) and you know fundamental coding practices, you should be able to PROGRAM fairly well.  But that is hardly the battle.  Figuring out everything else, now that is the battle.  Take some Psychology courses is my advice...</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1450"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1772</id><published>2004-07-30T10:38:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-30T10:38:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Advice For John</title><content type="html">a) Hey, if programming really is his calling, he'll wind up doing it no matter his degree. ;) 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;b) Agree that Antrhopology won't teach you to code. But I'd argue that CS degrees won't either. More useful, yes, but not by much IMO. 
&lt;br /&gt;

No content changes. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I'm writing console applications, I tend to put a try-catch block around everything in the Main loop, primarily to let me return a non-zero exit code from the application, which makes it play well with batch scripts. But it also makes it a good place to print error messages that pertain to well-known exception types. So I wind up with something like this: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size="4" color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;static&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;int&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt; Main(&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;string&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;[] args) &lt;/font&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;try &lt;/font&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;font color="#008000"&gt;// Do application logic here&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/font&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;catch&lt;/font&gt; (ParseCommandLineException pce) {&lt;br /&gt;    Console.WriteLine("Usage error");&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;return&lt;/font&gt; 27; &lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;catch&lt;/font&gt; (Exception e) {&lt;br /&gt;    Console.WriteLine(e); &lt;br /&gt;    &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;return&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; 42; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;When writing WinForms applications, returning a non-zero return code generally isn't necessary, since it's atypical to want to automate a GUI application using batch scripting methods. However, having a global exception filter is still a useful thing. For example, when &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FlexWikiPad"&gt;FlexWikiPad&lt;/a&gt; encounters an unhandled exception, it captures the exception and displays a dialog box that gives the user the option of emailing the error message to me. This sort of feedback lets me know what error conditions users are running into most frequently, letting me fix the big PITA bugs first. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;But how do you do it? Because Windows Forms applications are event-driven, there's not really a convenient place to put a top-level try-catch block. Indeed, if you try to do something like this in a simple WinForms application: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;[STAThread] &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;static&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;void&lt;/font&gt; Main() {&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;try &lt;/font&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    Application.Run(&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;new&lt;/font&gt; Form1());&lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;catch&lt;/font&gt; (Exception e) {&lt;br /&gt;    MessageBox.Show("Error " + e.Message); &lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;private&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;void&lt;/font&gt; button1_Click(&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;object&lt;/font&gt; sender, System.EventArgs e) {&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;throw&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;new&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; Exception("Whoops"); &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;What you'll find is that when you run it, you get the following (probably familiar) window: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/craig/images/error.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that you'll &lt;strong&gt;only &lt;/strong&gt;see this error message if you run the app outside the debugger. Why? Because WinForms is making use of its own unhandled exception mechanism, and the default behavior differs based on whether you're debugging or not. This is slightly confusing, but worse it means that in some scenarios, your carefully-crafted catch block will never run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, you can override the default behavior, by hooking the Application object's ThreadException event, as in the following code: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;[STAThread] &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;static&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;void&lt;/font&gt; Main() {&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;  Application.ThreadException += &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;new&lt;/font&gt; System.Threading.ThreadExceptionEventHandler(Application_ThreadException);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Application.Run(&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;new&lt;/font&gt; Form1());&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;private&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;void&lt;/font&gt; button1_Click(&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;object&lt;/font&gt; sender, System.EventArgs e) {&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;throw&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;new&lt;/font&gt; Exception("Whoops"); &lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;private&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;static&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;void&lt;/font&gt; Application_ThreadException(&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;object&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; sender, System.Threading.ThreadExceptionEventArgs e) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;MessageBox.Show(e.Exception.Message); &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Now when you run the application - inside or outside the debugger - your ThreadException handler will get called whenever an unhandled exception is thrown. You can do whatever you want here - exit the application gracefully, insult the user, or use a web service to log the bug in some sort of central database. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That said, no, I haven't read your book, and yes, I think I should. :) 

But even assuming I had read it, the fact remains that your book is in inconvenient, paper-only form that Google can't find. Oh, and I assume you'd like me (and others) to pay for it.

So I plan to keep blogging WinForms bits as I figure them out. :) </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1455"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1461</id><published>2004-06-14T06:43:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-06-14T06:43:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: WinForms Catch-All Exception Handling</title><content type="html">
Of course there must be some renumeration for all the hard work Chris put into coming out with with the Winforms book but the simple fact is I found this post by Craig _immediately_ useful.

And for Chris's sake, no I haven't checked the book yet to see if it's explicitly stated in there, but...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The above "catch-all" only works at "catching" exceptions (meaning in the try/catch sense of the word) that occur "inside of" the Application.Run() scope.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;What I mean is, if for better or worse, you go and write some code that runs in the main() function above, after the Application.ThreadException event handler creation, but before the Application.Run() line, the ThreadException handler will receive an event for an exception that occurs in that "middle code", but will not "catch" it in the sense of the try/catch world.  As a result, your application will still crash (or offer you to attach a debugger to it).  The ThreadException handler WILL get a chance to "inspect" the exception, log it, etc before the application exits, but it will NOT catch it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So, the ThreadException handler will only "catch" exceptions that occur inside of the Application.Run() scope.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;With that in mind, the amount of code that runs "outside of" the Application.Run() scope should be kept to a minimum, at least if you want to effectively use the above "catch-all" solution.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1455"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1570</id><published>2004-07-07T11:04:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-07T11:04:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: WinForms Catch-All Exception Handling</title><content type="html">Good point.

I've already got one there to catch SecurityException (primarily for catching people running the apps off of a network share) and ConfigurationException (primarily for catching bad edits to app.config entries that someone might have made).  My question, and one that I'll possibly be looking into further revolves around try/catch overhead.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Everyone claims that there is an execution performance overhead with putting try/catch blocks around "everything" (meaning in EVERY method).  Based on that, is there a similar overhead with having that "final catch-all" try/catch(Exception) block in main()?  And what about just having a try/catch block in main() with just the few specific exceptions that I've listed above?  For as much as I've read people's complaints about the execution performance overhead of overzealous try/catch usage, I've never seen it benchmarked anywhere in a way that I would have a definitive answer to it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I will agree that it's more than obvious when it comes to relying on exceptions for application logic flow, as you can literally "feel" the application slow down as exceptions get created, thrown, caught, etc.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I will also agree whole-heartedly that overzealous use of try/catch blocks makes your code border on painfull to read.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, in the fast-paced world of consulting that I work in, appearance is everything.  I'd rather have a client come to me saying, hey, this doesn't seem to work properly in such and such of a situation, than have them complaining about an application that throws error dialogs in their face on a regular basis.  .NET has made it extremely easy to setup a code framework for doing this in "a much better way than in the past".  I'd just like to have real numbers that indicate things like execution performance issues with various methods of accomplishing this goal, and I've yet to really find them.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1455"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1575</id><published>2004-07-07T18:44:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-07T18:44:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: WinForms Catch-All Exception Handling</title><content type="html">As with any performance question, the answer is "it depends", which is why you won't generally find many hard numbers out there...because they don't mean crap out of context. The answer is to try it and measure. Fortunately, this is easy to do. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;That said, my uniformed opinion is that that "everyone" is smoking crack if they think that the mere presence of even many catch statements is going to have a noticable impact on perf in a WinForms application. I'd be surprised if the try block setup is very expensive at all. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, *catching* exceptions is definitely expensive. It's expensive enough to be able to perceive it in some WinForms apps. But if your app never actually throws any exceptions, it shouldn't matter. And when it does, you probably have other things to worry about than perf. And if you're throwing them often enough to have to worry about perf, then you *definitely* have other problems. :) </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1455"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1576</id><published>2004-07-07T20:19:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-07T20:19:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: WinForms Catch-All Exception Handling</title><content type="html">Agreed on the performance stuff :P

&lt;br /&gt;In an effort to hopefully bring this all to an end, seeing how I hate starting something and not ending it, it turns out that Chris's book was good in pointing out what you originally did above (as Chris pointed out to you).  But it wasn't until I dug into Jeffrey Richter's "Applied Microsoft .NET Framework Programming" book that I found the definitive answers to all of this "unhandled exception stuff".  It's ritten right there on pages 438-441 in very simple English.

thanks for this great tip!
5 years later and it still is an amazing way of catching all exceptions.

but, it seems to work only in the main thread. It doesn't seem

is there a way to catch  those too?

The answer, of course, is...everything. But I was particularly impressed by &lt;a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/psexec.shtml"&gt;PsExec&lt;/a&gt;, a tool that gives you telnet-like shell connectivity to another machine without having to install anything on the remote machine!! I just run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;psexec \\avalon cmd.exe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and like magic I have a command prompt that displays on my &lt;em&gt;local &lt;/em&gt;machine that is actually executing commands over on the &lt;em&gt;remote &lt;/em&gt;machine (avalon in my example). I repeat: without having to install anything on the remote machine. You can launch GUI applications, but they show up on the remote machine. Regardless, it's still killer for command-line guys like me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love it, but how the hell do they do that? &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>38</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1466</id><published>2004-06-15T15:46:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-06-15T15:46:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: PsExec - How Do They *Do* That? </title><content type="html">Here's how it probably works:

They call CreateService on the target machine, pointing the image back through a file share to your copy of PSEXEC.EXE (I've never tried wiring up a service to an EXE image on a shared drive, but if that doesn't work, they could just as easily copy the EXE to the remote machine in a temp directory).

Then they call StartService to start the server running. To redirect a command prompt, all you really are doing is tying a socket to a command interpreter, which is super easy to do (check out rootkit.com for examples ;-)

This wouldn't work if you weren't using SMB (for example, on a hardened web server where you've removed the client and workstation services).

Now Craig will have to run NetMon and tell me if I was even close!

This is a tricky way to bootstrap something like this (cmdasuser.exe used to do this). When a service deletes itself (deletes its service entry from the registry by calling DeleteService), as soon as the service process terminates, the SCM removes the registry key for the service.

They might also be using the trick of having their service simply launch a raw copy of the same EXE image and terminate immediately so that they reduce the window of time in which a service appears on the remote system. I used to play this game with cmdasuser as well.

The ability to do this should scare anyone who runs as a network admin all the time! Malware can play these sorts of games just as easily as PSEXEC can.

However, my assumption is that they push the service exe to the remote machine via (say) the C$ file share, rather than pulling it from the source machine.

Checking...

Yep, the service winds up in C:\windows\system32 on the remote machine, which suggests to me that it pushes it via the winnt$ share. 

It looks like the service deletes both the service entry and the executable when the task finishes. Which certainly is scary, but is also quite clever. 

I haven't run netmon yet, but one thing I'd be curious about is to see whether there's any attempt at channel encryption. I really doubt it, which would be disappointing, but unsurprising. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1465"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1469</id><published>2004-06-16T20:34:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-06-16T20:34:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: PsExec - How Do They *Do* That? </title><content type="html">Why do programmers have to come up with elaborate solutions and conclusions when the answer is right in front of you: gnomes.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'm looking for a way to remotely collect system information from our servers world wide.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;What I' looking for right now is a tool to substract the 'ipconfig /all' information from remote servers without needing the 'Administrative' access rights. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So, I tought this could be accomplished using the '-s' parameter hereby using the local 'SYSTEM'. But I still receive the 'Access is denied' error message. When I put myself in the 'Administrators' group, the access is granted and the output is shown correctly on the screen.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Can anyone explain why the '-s' parameter does not give the expected result?
&lt;br /&gt;

I have had this issue before and if I am not mistaken i got around it by using the local admin account of the remote machine so: 

psexec -accepteula \\VirualMachineVM5 -u localhost\administrator  -p &lt;Password&gt; cmd

I know this is just a work around but hopefully its a limited issue.

&lt;p&gt;Is there any science in &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/joen/archive/2004/06/10/153245.aspx"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;? Or just your idea of what makes sense? I don't ask to be accusatory - I have a real reason. :) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I was teaching a short .NET class at the University of Waterloo. I used emacs for something in front of the class, and one of the professors mentioned that a grad student of his had researched the impact of key bindings on productivity. He studied the emacs key bindings, a carefully designed set of bindings, and (as a sort of control) a completely random set of bindings. What was interesting was that users were able to learn even the random key bindings in fairly short order. What was &lt;strong&gt;more &lt;/strong&gt;interesting however, was that the emacs bindings &lt;em&gt;tied&lt;/em&gt; the random key bindings for usability! Both of them were significantly worse than the carefully designed set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point to all of this, of course, is that there isn't really an easy way to gauge how “good” a set of key bindings is. If you're really interested in helping developers, please actually do some research and see what works. Maybe you've already done this (kudos if so), but from your post it doesn't look this way. And at a company that actually does usability studies, I suspect you have the people in-house who could help you do it right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it probably doesn't matter to me personally. Based on watching hundreds of students and dozens of colleagues work, I know I'm an atypical user when it comes to keyboard/mouse usage patterns. So even if you do come up with something that's optimized for your typical customer, I'll likely hate it. :) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: &lt;/strong&gt;Joe &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/joen/archive/2004/06/19/160286.aspx"&gt;responds&lt;/a&gt; that he did indeed work with a usability team to come up with the new keybindings. Very good! Apologies for any aspersions that were inferred - this is the sort of careful work that should be congratulated, whether or not you agree with the decision to change things. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1472</id><published>2004-06-18T13:26:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-06-18T13:26:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Whither Keybindings? </title><content type="html">I also think it has to deal with the type of people your dealing with, i.e. having people in a development environment vs. a user environment. When my wife asks me how to do something across our two desks, I'll usually answer in some cryptic (she says) combination of Control-Meta-tap-dance-hokey-pokey when she is looking for "click here. then here. then here." When teaching our interns how to use subversion / dreamweaver / whatever I find myself getting frustrated because they're taking so long using the mouse to get around.

Look at Mac kids, some of them are key binding wizards, but 99.9% of them know Cmd-Q because it benefits them directly.

Although Apple's move to put emacs key bindings in XCode (Project Builder) was one hell of a coup.

I'm in your camp. Just it sucks when you change them on people. Imagine if emacs changed their bindings, you'd have an enormous amount of gripes, but like any change in the software world, people will get over it.

&lt;p&gt;My, my, it has been quiet around here for the last week, hasn't it? My excuse is that I was in New Hampshire all week, working heads down on the MSDN rewrite with &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tewald"&gt;Tim Ewald&lt;/a&gt; and some other friends. My &lt;strong&gt;other &lt;/strong&gt;excuse (always have a backup ready) is that I'm working on some big changes to this blog...but more about that soon enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim is always a font of entertaining but useless jokes, and enlightening and useful XML knowledge. One thing he pointed out to me this week was &lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;SoapDocumentMethodAttribute&lt;/font&gt;, in particular when specified with &lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;SoapParameterStyle.Bare&lt;/font&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow me to explain. Compare the XML produced by the following two functionally equivalent SOAP endpoints: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;[WebMethod] &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;int&lt;/font&gt; Add(&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;int&lt;/font&gt; x, &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;int&lt;/font&gt; y) { &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;return&lt;/font&gt; x + y; } &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;and &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;[WebMethod] &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;[SoapDocumentMethod(ParameterStyle=SoapParameterStyle.Bare)]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;int&lt;/font&gt; Add(&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;int&lt;/font&gt; x, &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;int&lt;/font&gt; y) { &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;return&lt;/font&gt; x + y; } &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the request/response messages for the first variation: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr id="null" /&gt;
POST /play/bare.asmx HTTP/1.1&lt;br /&gt;Host: localhost&lt;br /&gt;Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8&lt;br /&gt;Content-Length: length&lt;br /&gt;SOAPAction: "http://tempuri.org/Add"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;soap:Envelope br="br"&gt;        xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" &lt;br /&gt;        xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;soap:Body&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;ADD&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      &lt;X&gt;int&lt;/X&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      &lt;Y&gt;int&lt;/Y&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/ADD&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/soap:Body&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;HTTP/1.1 200 OK&lt;br /&gt;Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8&lt;br /&gt;Content-Length: length&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;soap:Envelope br="br"&gt;        xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" &lt;br /&gt;        xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;soap:Body&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;ADDRESPONSE&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      &lt;ADDRESULT&gt;int&lt;/ADDRESULT&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/ADDRESPONSE&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/soap:Body&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr id="null" /&gt;
and here they are for the second variation: 
&lt;hr id="null" /&gt;
POST /play/bare.asmx HTTP/1.1&lt;br /&gt;Host: localhost&lt;br /&gt;Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8&lt;br /&gt;Content-Length: length&lt;br /&gt;SOAPAction: "&lt;a href="http://tempuri.org/Add"&gt;http://tempuri.org/Add&lt;/a&gt;"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;soap:Envelope courier="courier" new="new"&gt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;" &lt;br /&gt;        xmlns:xsd="&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;" &lt;br /&gt;        xmlns:soap="&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;"&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;soap:Body&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;X courier="courier" new="new"&gt;http://tempuri.org/"&amp;gt;int&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;Y courier="courier" new="new"&gt;http://tempuri.org/"&amp;gt;int&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/Y&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/X&gt;&lt;/soap:Body&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;HTTP/1.1 200 OK&lt;br /&gt;Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8&lt;br /&gt;Content-Length: length&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;soap:Envelope courier="courier" new="new"&gt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;" &lt;br /&gt;        xmlns:xsd="&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;" &lt;br /&gt;        xmlns:soap="&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;"&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;soap:Body&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;ADDRESULT courier="courier" new="new"&gt;http://tempuri.org/"&amp;gt;int&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/ADDRESULT&gt;&lt;/soap:Body&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="+0"&gt;&lt;soap:Envelope _="_"&gt;&lt;font size="+0"&gt;&lt;soap:Envelope _="_"&gt;&lt;font size="+0"&gt;&lt;soap:Envelope _="_"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr id="null" /&gt;
Notice the big difference? With the second variation, the wrapper element that corresponds to the method name has been removed. Which is nice, because it's superfluous - the method is already specified by the SOAPAction header. This is particularly nice in the response message where that extra level of indirection looks a little silly. &lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;To me, this just seems like nicer XML; more like how I would do it if I were just using XmlWriter and raw sockets. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1482</id><published>2004-06-27T11:03:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-06-27T11:03:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: I Like It Bare</title><content type="html">The problem is, however, is that SOAPAction is an HTTP header which ties you to HTTP as a protocol unless you have endpoints with only one method - in other words the context of the body either has to be defined using an HTTP construct or be implicit from the endpoint itself</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1481"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1483</id><published>2004-06-27T11:25:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-06-27T11:25:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: I Like It Bare</title><content type="html">First, I'm not sure I even agree with that whole "Oh, maybe we want to switch to protocol X" line of argument...it smacks of the "we might want to switch from SQL Server to Oracle some day" line of thought that leads to horrendous architectural abominations.

Third, RESTians would argue that having the operation implicit from the endpoint is a fundamental goodness, although clearly the ASP.NET bits don't work that way today.

It wasn't so much a switch protocols kind thing as a "I might not want to use HTTP in the first place" kind of thing. And I know we are talking about an ASP.NET attribute - but then it wasn't so much about the attribute, rather the resulting message schema. 

I agree that possibly 1 endpoint = 1 operation is a good thing, but I was just pointing out that adopting that schema either bound you to HTTP or forced you to 1 endpoint = 1 operation.

Just kidding. :) Yes, I too wish Tim would hurry up and post. We'll see - I was bugging him about it all last week. If he drags his feet any more, I'm going to start writing his posts for him. 

Cleve: you're right, that is ugly, but generally not a problem since the "other things you do" that I waved my hands at take care of it. Suffice it to say that the Calculator example I chose sucks. Keep your eyes peeled for what Tim has to say on this one. 

On the packet size front, compressing your HTTP stream is a great idea to begin with, and should take care of any issues with repeated namespaces to boot. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1481"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1487</id><published>2004-07-01T08:48:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-01T08:48:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: I Like It Bare</title><content type="html">To compare moving SOAP messages over something other than HTTP to switching from SQL Server to Oracle is a bit disingenuous.    The whole point of serializing a request into a SOAP document should be that it's transport neutral.  That's hardly the same thing as assuming that your TSQL implementation will port to Oracle.  
My biggest problem with the "bare" example is that you are losing some semantic information from your soap document (that the Add method is what you are calling).  Plus, since "AddResponse" is what still comes back as a reply, it no longer matches the request.  </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1481"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1516</id><published>2004-07-02T10:15:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-02T10:15:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: I Like It Bare</title><content type="html">So, I agree that the example I gave is sub-optimal, and that it doesn't really address the main use of the bare style. Tim does a better job of that in his post at &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/tewald/archive/2004/06/29/460.aspx" target="_new"&gt;http://pluralsight.com/tewald/archive/2004/06/29/460.aspx&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'm the first to agree that analogies prove nothing, so comments such as "it is/isn't the same thing as porting from Oracle to SQL server" are pretty empty on both sides. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But as far as the point of SOAP being protocol independence, I'd say that's not at all true. The "point" of SOAP is interoperability. At least 99% of the world currently does SOAP over HTTP, and that will continue to be the case for years. If every single one of them tied themselves inextricably to HTTP, the value of SOAP would decrease very, very little.

Try it with numbers other than 57675350989891243676868034225, and for moduluses (moduli?) other than 7 and 8, too. It breaks for those as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This appears to be a bug in the Decimal.Modulus routine - caveat emptor. Oh, and it's &lt;strong&gt;still&lt;/strong&gt; broken in the Whidbey version I'm running (40607).

But why did I move? And why so suddenly? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me address the last point first: the move was only sudden from a public point of view. I wanted to throw the switch and have everything flip over to the new site as quickly as possible because I wanted to take all my posts - and the comments on those posts - with me. The longer the lag between the new site going live and the old one getting redirected over, the more information I was going to lose (or have to move manually). So I've actually been talking to the Pluralsight guys about this for weeks, and have spent a fair number of evenings and lunch hours getting it set up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to "why". It's really simple, actually: because I think the Pluralsight guys are an absolutely top-notch group of dudes (as well as being good friends), and hanging out with them in virtuality seemed like it would be fun. They've got an exciting new company going and history, if nothing else, would indicate that they're going to be producing some excellent stuff. When they asked me if I'd be interested in coming over, I figured that if I can help them out by bringing some more traffic their way, I was happy to do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and as a consultant who lives by his reputation, it doesn't hurt me at all to hang my blog shingle up next to names like Aaron Skonnard, Don Box, Fritz Onion, Keith Brown, Mike Woodring, and Tim Ewald. :) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to thank Fritz and Keith in particular for handling their side the transition of CraigBlog - I've got a fair amount of content, and I had some requirements that they had to run around a bit to meet. I'd also like to think &lt;a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/"&gt;Peter Provost&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote the excellent &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dasblog2dottext/"&gt;dasBlog2dotText&lt;/a&gt; conversion tool, which is what made it possible for me to port all my content in a few hours rather than a few months. He and I are going to be releasing the tool on SourceForge this weekend - I'll be sure to let you know here (at my comfy new home on the web) when it's ready. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1521</id><published>2004-07-02T16:20:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-02T16:20:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: My New Home</title><content type="html">Good to see you in your new home among other great guys!

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;- The link to your articles should be more obvious. I spent quite some time looking for them on the new site. Move those links a bit more to the top of the navigation pane, perhaps?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;- I'm missing a search function. But I guess that's already being taken care of, given the whole site is still quite new?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I like the new blog.

Well, they're right. The reason? My post was - to use the euphemistic engineering term for “lame“ - sub-optimal. But allow me to explain, hopefully clearing up any web service confusion that may have arisen. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tim and I had had an interesting conversation one afternoon while I was at his place, in which he explained to me the pattern he describes in his post...of which SoapParameterStyle.Bare is an part, but only a part. More important is combining SoapParameterStyle.Bare with the style of using a single input and single output parameter - without this you don't realize all the benefits that Tim outlines in his excellent blog entry. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyway, when I posted, I didn't want to tell the whole story, because I was trying to goad Tim into blogging it, and didn't want to steal his punchline.

It has to do with the [XmlInclude()] attribute that's part of the System.Xml.Serialization stuff. Ordinarily, you use it on a base type to indicate that when serializing instances of that type, they might &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; be instances of one or more subtypes. This allows the serialization engine to emit a schema that reflects the possibility of really getting a Derived when the type signature is Base. For example, consider the following web service: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;&amp;lt;%@ WebService class="Service" Language="C#" %&amp;gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;public class Animal {&lt;br /&gt;  public int legs; &lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;public class Mammal : Animal {&lt;br /&gt;  public int nipples; &lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;public class Service {&lt;br /&gt;  [WebMethod]&lt;br /&gt;  public Animal GetAnimal() {&lt;br /&gt;    return new Mammal(); &lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Note that GetAnimal is typed to return an Animal, but actually returns a Mammal. Well, if you were to look at the XML that came back from this method, you might be surprised to see that it looks like this: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;legs&amp;gt;8&amp;lt;/legs&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/Animal&amp;gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You'll observe that this result does not contain any mention of nipples - the “Mammalness” has been lost. Which makes sense - from an XML standpoint, you told me that the operation returns a type that just has legs. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One way we can “fix” this to give a result more in keeping with our OO expectations is to use the XmlInclude attribute on the base type, to list all the types that we might wind up substituting. It looks like this: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;[System.Xml.Serialization.XmlInclude(typeof(Mammal))]&lt;br /&gt;public class Animal {&lt;br /&gt;  public int legs; &lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And if we run our web service now, we get this XML back:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;&amp;lt;Animal xsi:type="Mammal"&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;legs&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/legs&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;nipples&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/nipples&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/Animal&amp;gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Note the presence of the xsi:type attribute, which says, “This thing is actually a Mammal.” If you're generating a .NET proxy using VS.NET's Add Web Reference or the wsdl.exe command line tool, you'll even find that when you check the type of the object that comes back from the web service call, it's a Mammal, which derives from Animal. This is possible because in the schema for the web service, there's a bit that says that a Mammal is an &lt;em&gt;extension&lt;/em&gt; (an XML schema term) of Animal. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you're an OO person, however, you probably don't like the fact that you have to hang that XmlInclude attribute off the base type. The idea that a base type has to know about its derived types in advance is, well, just plain weird. This is where Simon comes in. He pointed out that you can actually put the XmlInclude attribute on the &lt;em&gt;method&lt;/em&gt; instead of the base type. So if we change our web service to look like this instead: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;&amp;lt;%@ WebService class="Service" Language="C#" %&amp;gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;public class Animal {&lt;br /&gt;  public int legs; &lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;public class Mammal : Animal {&lt;br /&gt;  public int nipples; &lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;public class Service {&lt;br /&gt;  [System.Web.Services.WebMethod]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;  [System.Xml.Serialization.XmlInclude(typeof(Mammal))]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  public Animal GetAnimal() {&lt;br /&gt;    return new Mammal(); &lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We'll get the same result (i.e. it'll have legs and nipples and use the xsi:type attribute) as putting the attribute on the Animal type. But putting it on the method is &lt;em&gt;much &lt;/em&gt;more attractive from a code point of view, since it doesn't bake assumptions about type derivation into the base type. Rather, you put them on the method, where you probably have a good idea about what exact types are being returned. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, that said, I wouldn't write web services using this. Why not? Because if you care about interoperability, writing schemas that make use of extension elements and xsi:type isn't exactly “polite“. You don't know what technology your clients will be written in, and not all languages even have type derivation. Those that do, don't necessarily take the same view of it as C#. And even if they do, not all toolkits are smart enough yet to both map the XSD extension correctly and to look for the xsi:type attri&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>30</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1582</id><published>2004-07-08T15:42:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-08T15:42:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: XmlInclude - Not Quite as Useless as I Thought</title><content type="html">The downside of this approach is that if you have multiple webmethods that return Animals, you need to be sure you annotate each one (it can be easy to forget - speaking from experience).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you want to XMLSerialize the types directly for some reason (rather than using the ASMX framework to do it), including the XmlInclude on the base class is necessary.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As for whether this appraoch is "polite", I'm not entirely convinced. Can't you assume that the client has full XML schema support? If not, which subsets are OK and which aren't?</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1580"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1583</id><published>2004-07-08T16:01:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-08T16:01:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: XmlInclude - Not Quite as Useless as I Thought</title><content type="html">Agreed - obviously there comes a point where it's harder to annotate the methods than it is to annotate the base type. But as I said, I'm no fan of this attribute in any form - at some point you cross the line that separates XML that's easy to convert to/from objects, and you're better off doing it by hand. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Can you assume the client has full XSD support? Hell no. But which subsets? That's still shaking out. Some of the WS Basic Profile work is attempting to codify what's expected, but even there you've got lots of toolkits, and not all are conforming. It's a huge mess, and the rule remains "Know your clients". I don't expect that to change any time soon, so I tend to design web services that use pretty simple XML if I care about interoperability. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1580"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1584</id><published>2004-07-08T17:42:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-08T17:42:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: XmlInclude - Not Quite as Useless as I Thought</title><content type="html">Just out of curiousity, do you know of any tools specifically that can't handle extensions?</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1580"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1585</id><published>2004-07-08T17:51:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-08T17:51:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: XmlInclude - Not Quite as Useless as I Thought</title><content type="html">Nope, nothing specifically. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1580"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1588</id><published>2004-07-09T04:27:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-09T04:27:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: XmlInclude - Not Quite as Useless as I Thought</title><content type="html">One reason to use this technique is if you don't have access to the base type.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In this case, it depends on how often you're using it, since there's extensive caching in the XmlSerializer infrastructure, and high setup costs. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'm not aware of any specific issues with XmlInclude, although I've never measured it. I'd be a bit surprised if it added significantly to the cost of using XmlSerializer.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But there's no way around simply measuring the performance in your particular scenario. You just have to do it.

I've tried a combination of things to get it to serialize properly:  Added an XmlType attribute to the external class to match the same namespace as the webservice;  edited the asmx to make a reference to the assembly; used XmlInclude on the webservice method to try to force it to spit out the schema for the external type...NOTHING!

The problem, it appears, isn't that it is in an external assembly. Rather, that the entire set of properites on the class is ReadOnly (only getters, no setters).  I am guessing that since there is no support for denoting an attribute as read only in XSD, it doesn't translate well to web services.  Mystery solved.  Thanks for all your help.

So if no setter exists, then XmlSerializer (and therefore WebServices) won't work. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;There is a way around this, however. You can implement an interface called IXmlSerializable, and take care of the serialization yourself.

&lt;br /&gt;1) A misconfiguration of your web server. Be sure that you can hit it with a browser from the machine where you're running the windows app. 
&lt;br /&gt;2) A problem with the serialization of MyClass. You can test this by using XmlSerializer directly against an instance of MyClass, without going through web services.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;A better syntax / concept would be:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;public class Mammal : Animal {
&lt;br /&gt;  [System.Xml.Serialization.XmlInclude(typeof(Animal)
&lt;br /&gt;  public int nipples; 
&lt;br /&gt;}
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Then the serializer would be able to check and see if this subclass was allowed to be serialized in the context of serializing the superclass.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Turns out you can use the XMLInclude attribte to decorate the WebService class, that way you don't have to decorate each method.  Also, if you have a webmethod that either returns the base type, or accepts it as a parameter, you don't even have to mess with XMLInclude.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1580"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>47526</id><published>2007-05-27T19:48:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-05-27T19:48:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: XmlInclude - Not Quite as Useless as I Thought</title><content type="html">I don't know if anyone reads this, but I ran into problems with xmlinclude so here is my little type hack:

Small world.  

I'm running across this issue just dumping an object Graph to XML.  Unfortunately, neither annotating the base class nor a method will help me.  Martin's solution is the only one available to me.  Unfortunately something in the obnoxious business model library I'm forced to use is overriding the behavior.  As it's just a piece of my test harness, it's not worth too large a time investment.  

In the troubleshooting process however, I discovered the reference below that describes how to turn on preservation of temporary serialization assemblies, and debug through them.  Might help somebody else that ends up here.

As for myself, I have always dealt with this issue in XML serialization the same way (anticipating all the derivate types in the base class attributes is certainly not very elegant). but I've never verified if JSON has the same issue. That's just an idea...

It gives the ability to make requests to an ASP.NET web page, and then easily verify that the contents of various server controls have rendered correctly. And it plugs into NUnit, so you get that same red/yellow/green display. I even managed to make it populate a login form with my credentials, click the submit button, and verify that it redirected me to the right page. Took about three minutes to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being useful for doing TDD of web apps, this is definitely something that should make writing build verification tests easier. Build verification tests (BVTs) are distinctly different from unit tests, in that they are intended to work against the system as a whole, rather than against a small piece of code. So as one of its last steps, the build script can copy the newly compiled web content to the file system, create a virtual directory, then use nunit-console to run tests that hit various pages, making sure everything works okay as deployed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>9</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1634</id><published>2004-07-15T09:02:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-15T09:02:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: NUnitAsp First Impressions: I Like It</title><content type="html">Have you created a test using roles from your user object?  </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1614"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1640</id><published>2004-07-16T10:15:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-16T10:15:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: NUnitAsp First Impressions: I Like It</title><content type="html">Not yet.

After all, I've spent a large chunk of my free time in the last six months writing &lt;a href="http://sf.net/projects/fwcontrib"&gt;tools to make editing FlexWiki easier&lt;/a&gt;. So this weekend, while I was in Minnesota attending a wedding of a close friend, I found myself sitting around my parents' house with no broadband Internet. After recovering from email withdrawal, I decided it was a good time to port my content to the heretofore empty &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/"&gt;Pluralsight wiki&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I have! This change of technologies brings several benefits: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's easier for me to edit things in real time. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can ditch the hand-rolled code I wrote to support my articles. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other people can contribute more easily. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wiki has a series of RSS feeds so people can find out about changes and new articles. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since FlexWiki is open source, we get the benefit of any improvements the community makes, without having to wait for Craig to get free time. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I've got everything moved over except the translations of my Direct3D tutorial. Because they're not in English, it's a bit harder for me to make sure I got everything right, and I'm punting it for now. I do plan to move those as well, though, after I recover from being offline for four days. I'll also put up redirects for the existing repository before too long. &lt;/p&gt;

The twist? Only some users of the application use SSO: the rest have accounts that exist only in the application database. So we couldn't just flip on “integrated authentication” in IIS and party on. But with the help of &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/"&gt;Keith Brown&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to figure out a pretty nifty solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick was realizing that if you enable &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; “anonymous“ and “integrated“ authentication for a particular virtual directory, the browser won't try to authenticate to the web server until it receives a 401 (Unauthorized) back from the web server. But you can issue your &lt;strong&gt;own&lt;/strong&gt; 401 any time you like! So what I did was to just set up Forms authentication as normal, but also provided a checkbox on the login form that said, “Use my network credentials.” Then, in my login form, I did something like this: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size="4" color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;class&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; Login : Page {&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;protected&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; Label ErrorMessageLabel; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;protected&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; TextBox UsernameTextBox; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;protected&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; TextBox PasswordTextBox; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;protected&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; CheckBox CheckBox1; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;void&lt;/font&gt; Page_Load(&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;object&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; o, EventArgs e) {&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;if&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; (IsPostBack) {&lt;br /&gt;      &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;string&lt;/font&gt; authenticatedUser = &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;null&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;; &lt;br /&gt;      &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;if&lt;/font&gt; (CheckBox1.Checked) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#008000" face="Courier New"&gt;// Use their network credentials &lt;br /&gt;      &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;string&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt; user = Request.ServerVariables["LOGON_USER"];&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;if&lt;/font&gt; (user.Length == 0) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#008000" face="Courier New"&gt;// They haven't provided credentials yet&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;{ &lt;br /&gt;          &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;Response.StatusCode = 401;&lt;br /&gt;          Response.StatusDescription = "Unauthorized";&lt;br /&gt;          Response.End(); &lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;else&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#008000" face="Courier New"&gt;// They have&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;          &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;authenticatedUser = user; &lt;br /&gt;        &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;      }&lt;br /&gt;      &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;else&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#008000" face="Courier New"&gt;// Use the username and password they provide&lt;br /&gt;      &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;         &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;if&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt; (IsPasswordOK(UsernameTextBox.Text, PasswordTextBox.Text)) {&lt;br /&gt;          authenticatedUser = UsernameTextBox.Text; &lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;      }&lt;br /&gt;      &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;if&lt;/font&gt; (authenticatedUser != &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;null&lt;/font&gt;) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#008000" face="Courier New"&gt;// They authenticated successfully&lt;br /&gt;      &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;font color="#008000"&gt;// Issue the Forms Auth cookie and send them on their way&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        FormsAuthentication.RedirectFromLoginPage(authenticatedUser, &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;false&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;);&lt;br /&gt;      }&lt;br /&gt;      &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;else&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#008000" face="Courier New"&gt;// They didn't&lt;br /&gt;      &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;ErrorMessageLabel.Text = "Invalid username or bad password. Please try again."; &lt;br /&gt;      &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;What this does is - when the user submits the login - check to see whether they want to authenticate by providing a username and password (normal Forms authentication) or whether they want to authenticate automatically, using their logged-in credentials. Right now, I'm figuring this out by having them explicity check a checkbox, but I do lots of other things. For example, I could have them always enter their username, and then go look in the database to see whether they're supposed to get a SSO login or a normal one. Or I could have them check the checkbox once and remember their settings forever after in a cookie. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Whatever mechanism I decide on, the trick here is that I can force the browser to authenticate by sending back a 401. Then, in subsequent visits, I can check the LOGON_USER server variable to see if the authentication was successful or not. If it is, I'm perfectly welcome to issue them a valid Forms Authentication login, secure in the knowledge that the user has proven knowledge of their password to IIS already. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;If the user is using IE, the authentication will happen automatically, using whatever credentials they're logged in to the client machine with. It works in Firefox, too, but they get that little username/password popup dialog box. Oh well - maybe the Firefox people will add auto login in a future release, or someone will write an extension. But failing that, providing SSO only to IE users is good enough for us. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>31</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1712</id><published>2004-07-26T07:25:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-26T07:25:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Mixing Forms and Windows Authentication</title><content type="html">Mixing Forms and Windows Authentication</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1699"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1732</id><published>2004-07-27T11:59:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-27T11:59:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">RE: Mixing Forms and Windows Authentication</title><content type="html">That, sir, is completely hardcore. :) Slick.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1699"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1733</id><published>2004-07-27T12:27:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-27T12:27:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Mixing Forms and Windows Authentication</title><content type="html">I aim to please. ;) </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1699"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1935</id><published>2004-08-18T09:54:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-08-18T09:54:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Mixing Forms and Windows Authentication</title><content type="html">Craig,
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This is pretty cool -- you could make this even better by using my Credentials Screening solution (&lt;a href="http://glazkov.com/blog/archive/2004/06/06/189.aspx" target="_new"&gt;http://glazkov.com/blog/archive/2004/06/06/189.aspx&lt;/a&gt;). That way, you won't even need to see a login form if your network credentials are valid.

This is an IE-only solution, and IE already doesn't pop up a dialog box. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In order to never display a login form, you have to catch the second 401 that happens when they provide network credentials that are no good, or fail to provide any to your first challenge. And the problem with that is, the dialog box that pops up for non-IE users pops up after the first challenge, so you'd still have that. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I guess what you'd have to do is to figure out based on the user-agent string which browser they're using, and react accordingly. Assuming they haven't used one of the many available plugins to make it lie to you. :) If you did that, though, you'd be able to skip displaying the form and go straight to the challenge. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it would be a moderately complicated piece of code. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1699"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1939</id><published>2004-08-18T11:36:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-08-18T11:36:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Mixing Forms and Windows Authentication</title><content type="html">IE doesn't always let you slip through withouth the dialog box. For example, if you are accessing the site that is not in your Local Intranet zone, you will get the dialog box no matter what. Credentials Screening solution I proposed addresses this exact problem. Otherwise, in your solution, even after you check the "use network credentials" checkbox, you will a standard security dialog box unless the site in Local Intranet zone, which may or may not be the case, depending on the configuration of the network.

System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity wi = Request.LogonUserIdentity;

Others:
On a side note: I got it working in MVC3 (is integrated with my custom STS, so my STS converts the windows user into a formsidentity.)

For Windows authentication, I redirect to a seperate page which has Forms/Anonymous Authentication disabled and Windows Authentication enabled. For other users (or applications aka Relying Parties in WIF terminology), I redirect to regular Forms Authentication page.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;* Better google integration
&lt;br /&gt;* A rich community of plugin developers, or, more generally, because it has serious momentum. 
&lt;br /&gt;* Incremental search built-in
&lt;br /&gt;* Better pop-up blocking
&lt;br /&gt;* The ability to change the font size regardless of what the stylesheet says (great for presentations)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But the main reason for me is to put the fire to the feet of MSFT: they walked away from IE and let it languish. Fine: let's see how they react when we walk away. If they choose to make a better browser than Firefox because of it, then I'll switch back. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Another reason to switch is to make me aware of the fact that IE isn't the only thing out there. When you feel the pain, it changes the way you code.

Don't know if it should be classified as a bug or just as a peculiar decision by the XmlSerializer team. Basically, the serializer checks if the current value is equal to the default value, and if it is it doesn't bother including it in the serialized XML. Presumably the assumption is whoever is consuming the XML on the "other side" already knows the default value and will simply use that when it encounters the missing value (for example, by initializing it in an object just as you did). It's kind of like the way a server control only persist a property's value in markup if the value is different from the default value.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This approach probably made more sense back in the "object to XML to object" days of the original ASMX model. Both the server-side object and the client-side proxy know the default value, so by not sending it there's a small performance gain. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;At least that's my guess for why it behaves that way. In any event, it makes a lot less sense in the "XML document exchange" model that is the current thinking for web services. Perhaps you can include this as a "customer ask" on Don Box's wiki. :)

(The oft-ignored third serialization mechanism in .NET...)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I wasn't aware that DefaultValue was used anywhere else actually, but in the world of Design Time, it has *always* meant "If this property has this value, you don't need to bother serializing it."
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'm slightly surprised to see it being used in the XML Serialization mechanism, but it is actually a pretty good match for the standard 'default value' semantics in XSD as someone already mentioned, so I suppose it does actually make sense. It's just that I always thought of this as being a part of the design time architecture.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'm not sure why you find the behaviour surprising - the behaviour you say you were expecting doesn't make any more sense to me. Indeed there are situations where it would the wrong thing - in certain design-time scenarios, there is a difference between explicitly setting a value to its default and leaving to be its default. (E.g. with the Windows Forms Control class, setting the BackColor property turns off the ambient behaviour for that property.)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;(Of course this means that if you specify [DefaultValue..] without actually making sure that the property/field really does have the default you say it will, it won't work properly.)</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1736"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1784</id><published>2004-08-01T11:30:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-08-01T11:30:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: DefaultValue and XmlSerializer Don't Mix? </title><content type="html">There are two reasons I find it surprising, although I now understand why it works the way it does. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;1) To cross namespaces like that (i.e. an  attribute from System.ComponentModel controlling the way System.Xml.Serialization works) seems dirty. This is purely aesthetic, of course, but part of good API design is not catching people off guard. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;2) I found it surprising because the somewhat subtle behavior incorrect behavior you rightly point out is exactly that...somewhat subtle. "Default value" has a semantic that to most people means, "If I don't do anything, otherwise, it should have *this* value."  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The latter point is, of course, a deficiency in my understanding. However, I highly doubt I'd be the only one (or even in the minority) when it comes to being caught off guard by the semanitcs here. Hence the post. ;) 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The real issue here is that the semantics of having a fixed default value in an XSD is just weird. It means that if I give you an instance document, you have to go look at the *schema* to figure out what the value of that attribute should be.

We had a performance issue with one Web service where the response message contained date/times.  Most of these values were effectively "null" (i.e. no time applicable), and serialising those values was taking up a lot of time and bandwidth.

&lt;br /&gt;I agree that it's nice to have the ability to do what you want (and you can do it without DefaultValue if you're willing to handle the XML yourself (which is pretty easy)) but I dislike the way it's implemented. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1736"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1811</id><published>2004-08-04T03:29:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-08-04T03:29:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: DefaultValue and XmlSerializer Don't Mix? </title><content type="html">There is a xxxSpecified mechanism that allows you to do the same thing - only serialize a field/property when you want to serialize it, when it holds a meaningful value.

So, I'll take a stab at defining them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, wikis are about authoring a set of static HTML pages. That's it. If you're trying to do something with a wiki that would be hard to do well with a set of &lt;strong&gt;free form&lt;/strong&gt; HTML pages written using Front Page, then you probably won't do it well with a wiki. A great example of this is discussions: wikis pretty much suck at threaded, back-and-forth conversations, because &lt;em&gt;free form, static web pages &lt;/em&gt;pretty much suck at this. Note that more constrained or more dynamic web applications might still do a decent job (think message boards), but a big ol' pile o' HTML is a long way from being a discussion board.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, for all the things it &lt;strong&gt;isn't &lt;/strong&gt;good at, there are &lt;a href="http://www.wikipedia.org"&gt;lots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;lots&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.GuideBook.HomePage"&gt;useful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig.DirectX.Direct3DTutorialIndex"&gt;things&lt;/a&gt; you can do with a set of hyperlinked HTML pages. So why wiki? Well, a wiki gives you two things: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaboration. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A simple authoring language. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collaboration one is the one you generally hear about most. The idea that lots of people can walk up to your website and author their very own page, or even edit one that &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;wrote is totally crazy-sounding, but turns out to be immensely powerful.in a lot of situations. Of course, because we can't trust everyone not to deface the shared page, most (not all) wiki engines offer version control to make it easy to undo what others have done, but I don't think version control is really central to the Zen of wiki. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I happen to think that the other major facet of wikis &lt;strong&gt;is &lt;/strong&gt;every bit as important as the first: the fact that they introduce a simple authoring language. For example, if you look at the language that &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; offers, it's simple do make something bold - you just *surround it with asterisks*. The wiki engine then interprets this into HTML that makes the enclosed text bold when the page is viewed. While this isn't much simpler than surrounding the same text with the equivalent &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; tags, it turns out that this syntax (and the other syntactic elements a good wiki language offers) are just &lt;em&gt;_enough_ &lt;/em&gt;simpler to lower the bar on contributions to the point where people are actually willing to spew their brains onto a page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really says a lot about human laziness that harnessing its power can do so much. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1748</id><published>2004-07-29T03:14:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-29T03:14:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Wiki and Wiki; What is Wiki?!?</title><content type="html">This is one of those posts where I agree with everything, not just the wiki stuff (see my blog/bliki for a few tricks I've come up with), but also the laziness bit:

Wiki's can be very powerful. As your article hints, it's a lot more powerful than just a bunch of static pages.

&lt;br /&gt;As it happens, I'm part of the core group working on a .NET Influncer's Wiki = at www.dotnetinfluencers.org.  Come on over and do the wiki thing!

&lt;br /&gt;I'm already reasonably facile with cmd.exe, which has the benefit of being present on every system I work with. Not that I'm not looking forward to having something better at some point. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;However, if it were just a matter of dropping to the command line, I'd be all set. However, there are many times where I'm using Explorer via the built-in dialog boxes of third-party GUI programs. So regardless of the shell I use, it's still a matter of broken functionality. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1785"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1794</id><published>2004-08-01T16:11:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-08-01T16:11:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Please Tell Me Why</title><content type="html">Maybe because your recycle bin is on the verge of reaching the limit?
&lt;br /&gt;Also, I believe delete from Windows explorer needs to notify many more listeners since it will be storing it in the recycle bin.. Such as making your COM dll registration to point at the recycle bin. . :)

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Since, last time I checked, 1% was the smallest amount of space you could allocate to the recycle bin (so about 600MB on my laptop...) there can be an awful lot of files in there.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;By the way if your system is particularly slow I recommend you clean your registry and then do a registry defragmentation.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;There are various registry cleaners that have a preview period but most of them limit the number of items you can clean.  Most recently I used RegSupremePro but i've used a numbe of others.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;To defrag your registry try pagedefrag from www.sysinternals.com.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This can make a huge speed difference in explorer operations.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Good luck

First of all, thanks to those who posted comments trying to help out - they led to a better understanding, and to a solution, respectively. They also led to me finding out about an interesting tool. Since I know not everyone reads the comments of every post, I thought I'd coalesce the interesting bits here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It turns out the XmlSerializer behavior is expected, and documented. Mostly, it's fallout from the XSD “fixed“ capability, which is basically pure evil: why would you make me go look at a schema to determine what the value of something should be? Yuck. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several people correctly pointed out that files were taking forever to delete because my Recycle Bin had too much crap in it - I had thought I had emptied it recently, but I guess not. &lt;a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/"&gt;Ian Griffiths&lt;/a&gt;, however, posts that he uses waste.exe from Tim Tabor's &lt;a href="http://www.cheztabor.com/BinManager/index.htm"&gt;BinManager&lt;/a&gt; to automate the process of cleaning out his Recycle Bin. Sounds interesting - I'll definitely have to check it out. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I was poking around trying to figure out my XmlSerializer problems, I came across &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cschittko/articles/33045.aspx"&gt;this little nugget&lt;/a&gt; about how to get XmlSerializer to show you the code it generates...now that might come in handy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On top of &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt;, the very cool &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mvp-xml"&gt;mvp-xml project&lt;/a&gt; just released &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/posts/SGen.aspx"&gt;SGen&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you do some pretty serious customization of the XmlSerializer process. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>1832</id><published>2004-08-07T06:19:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-08-07T06:19:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Too Much Fun With Anagrams</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dornstein/"&gt;David Ornstein&lt;/a&gt; (Sodden Rat In IV), I've been having some real fun with &lt;a href="http://www.wordsmith.org/anagram/advanced.html"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; the last few days. It's nothing new: I go there every few years. But I found some good ones this time: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Andera = In A Drag Race = Grand AI Race&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have the best name for anagrams, though, so I also tried “Mister Craig Alan Andera” and got “Giant Crania Mars Leader”, “Stir Male Arcadian Anger“, and “Tim's Anger: Canada Rail“. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, my personal favorite from that same set has to be “Incites Real Rad Anagram”. :) So, since it is apparently my destiny to get others to waste time this way, I'm asking &lt;strong&gt;you &lt;/strong&gt;(yes, you) to post your own best picks of your name/name variation.

&lt;br /&gt;Many aggregators understand peranent redirects. I posted a quick sample how to do this via code (if you don't have IIS access).

I'm using Peter Provost's excellent dasblog2dottext conversion tool, and sure enough, that's exactly what it does: I noticed this morning that my old subscription to my blog had been updated to the new URL because his redirect filter issues a 301. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The problem was that I hadn't configured my old blog to start redirecting the RSS feed. That has been taken care of. It was a simple config file change - took me all of 2 minutes. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1846"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>6333</id><published>2005-03-04T08:09:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-03-04T08:09:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Old Site RSS Redirect Added</title><content type="html">What address will the aggregator actually think its reading, the old URL or the new URL?

Well, today I got an email from management that (rightfully, in my opinion) pointed out that it was time to make a decision about whether my name would continue to be associated with their brand. Totally fair: until now I was deriving value from them by appearing on their website, being on their internal mailing lists, and so forth, without delivering any value back to them. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I stopped teaching back in March of 2003 because I was dead tired of it. Some guys can go on teaching the same material month in and month out. I guess they derive their satisfaction from seeing people “get it” for the first time. I think that sort of attitude is fantastic, and that devotion to the educational experience paired with technical excellence in the instructors is what drew me to DM in the first place. My problem was that I simply couldn't face presenting the same 400 slides one more time. I think I'd taught slight variations of their .NET curriculum 25 or 30 times by then. It was hard to get up and be energetic and enthusiastic at that point. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So I sort of slipped sideways into consulting. I got lucky and had a bunch of gigs come my way, and they paid well, and for a while I could simply and honestly say I was too busy when DM would call and ask me to teach a class. But as time passed, I realized that I was learning a lot consulting, and that the idea of having to teach a class was something that I didn't look forward to at all. So somewhere in the last 18 months, I left DM mentally. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today I left it for real. I let them know that - while I consider having taught at DM equivalent in prestige and educational value to my Masters from MIT - I would not be continuing my business relationship with them. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In practical terms, this doesn't mean much beyond that my name comes off their website, &lt;a href="mailto:candera@develop.com"&gt;candera@develop.com&lt;/a&gt; stops working, and I don't get to be on their internal mailing lists any more. And coming as it does after such a long break, it's hardly traumatic. Or even surprising. Still, I can't help but feel a certain sense of...not loss...maybe “transition“ is the right word. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don't know if I'll teach again in the future or not. I feel like I'm not done learning how to be a “real” developer yet, but I also know that my attention span is short enough that I'll have to do something different at some point. And I could see speaking in some form - classes, conferences, user groups, whatever - being a part of that. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>11</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1862</id><published>2004-08-13T07:22:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-08-13T07:22:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: End of an Era</title><content type="html">Thanks for sharing your very open and honest struggles with teaching vs. consulting.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I attended Guerilla .NET a few years ago in CA when you were teaching with Mike and Jason. You guys (and forgive me for lack of a better phrase) "rocked the house." I was an MCT for a few years training courses on the MCSD track, and could only dream of teaching at your level. I learned a ton, and paid for it myself since I work as an independent contractor. In short: it was totally worth it. Enjoy taking a nice long break and maybe eventually you'll get excited about it again. At least I hope so because there's a lot to be gleaned from your knowledge, experience, and quality training skills.

I've found CruiseControl.NET to be far more flexible and reliable than &lt;a href="http://draconet.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Draco.NET&lt;/a&gt;, the other major .NET CI tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I took on the role of buildmaster for &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt;. As we make the move to &lt;a href="http://www.sf.net/"&gt;SourceForge&lt;/a&gt;, I thought it would be an opportune moment to get a CI system set up, primarily because it would help us avoid the “source code, source code, who's got the source code” hell that we've been in for months now. So as I sat down and set up a CruiseControl instance, I had a chance to think about our needs, and about how we should configure things to allow us to grow the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, after thinking about it for a while, I came up with something I rather like. Since it differs somewhat from the out-of-the-box CruiseControl experience, I've gone ahead and written up what I did &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig.CruiseControlDirectoryHierarchy"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

I put together a list of resources for CruiseControl.NET here (&lt;a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2004/08/17/931.aspx" target="_new"&gt;http://haacked.com/archive/2004/08/17/931.aspx&lt;/a&gt;) and referenced your wiki.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In that post, I ask the question, what do you map your cruise control projects to in light of the directory structure recommended by article "Team Development with Visual Studio .NET and Visual SourceSafe"
&lt;br /&gt;(&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/tdlg_rm.asp" target="_new"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/tdlg_rm.asp&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I suppose a project would map to a system?</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1877"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1919</id><published>2004-08-17T16:38:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-08-17T16:38:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: CruiseControl.NET Configuration</title><content type="html">My very first recommendation is *not* to use SourceSafe. It is basically the worst source control system in widespread use (not counting GotDotNet), with the worst tooling, the worst model, the worst distributed team capability, and the least flexibility. Use Subversion or CVS (in that order) if you want excellent free alternatives. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;That said, I would point out that there's no relationship between what CCNET calls a "project" and a project in VS.NET or VSS. A CCNET project is merely a group of folders - any group of folders - in your source control that you monitor for changes. When something in them changes, you rebuild the contents. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'm no VSS expert, but I know you have some control over what users can see. For example, you could share a bunch of folders into a different hierarchy, and then monitor that, right? 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, it comes down to this: if it doesn't makes sense for changes in A to cause a rebuild of B, then you probably want to put A and B into different CCNET projects. Generally, I find that since .NET projects build so quickly, most projects can get by with just building everything on every change. 
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;You realize that VSS accepts credentials on the command-line, right? That is, it doesn't pick up on the currently logged-in user or anything. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Also, VSS is an ancient, outdated, piece of shit. You should really consider replacing it with something else. There are lots of fantastic choices, many of them free (SVN, bzr, etc.). 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But assuming you're unwilling or unable to do that, just make sure you provide the right credentials.

You can download version 0.93 &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=104906&amp;amp;package_id=112894"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. New features in this, the latest version include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find and replace. Not having this was killing me, so it's in. Ahhh...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help. Hopefully this will make it easier for new users to get started. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links within the application to the &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&amp;amp;group_id=104906&amp;amp;atid=639670"&gt;feature request&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&amp;amp;group_id=104906&amp;amp;atid=639667"&gt;bug reporting&lt;/a&gt; pages on &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fwcontrib/"&gt;the SourceForge project page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bunch of minor bugfixes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's really coming along! My plans for the future look like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt; Version 0.94 will probably be oriented toward a complete rewrite of the rendering engine, to make it totally customizable. That is, you'll be able to change a config file to add or alter: fonts, colors, and the regular expressions used to parse the document. I'll probably also take a look at performance, as I'm noticing some lag when typing in longer documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 0.95 will probably be about adding rudimentary online support, so separate usage of &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FwSync" onmouseout="TopicTipOff();" onmouseover="TopicTipOn(this, &amp;quot;id958&amp;quot;);"&gt;FwSync&lt;/a&gt; is not necessary. I'd also like to add a "Preview" function so you can see what your page will look like on the wiki to which you plan to post it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 0.96 will probably be focused on adding hierarchical and historical navigation and fixing the tree view so it actually works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then if that's all the major features I can think of, I'll focus on fixing bugs, cleaning up the code, performance, and stability en route to a 1.0 release. If I can get all this done before the baby is born, so much the better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, for all I know, I'm the only one actually using the thing. But regardless, it's been an interesting experience writing a GUI app, which is not something I usually do. It's been particularly interesting developing it with a TDD approach, as GUIs present some unique challenges. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>12</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1969</id><published>2004-08-19T13:16:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-08-19T13:16:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: FlexWikiPad 0.93 Released</title><content type="html">----</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1962"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1977</id><published>2004-08-20T05:57:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-08-20T05:57:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: FlexWikiPad 0.93 Released</title><content type="html">"Of course, for all I know, I'm the only one actually using the thing.".

&lt;br /&gt;Personaly i would prefer the preview and the integration of fwsync over the improved render enginee.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Additionally i would like the support of more characters then just ascii for TopicNames.

&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I'm coming to se that integrated online is a major feature point. I may move it up to be the next thing to happen. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As far as support for non-ASCII characters, I agree that this is something that needs to happen.

Sure enough, I was able to verify them. D'oh! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, like any responsible software vendor, I committed to getting a patch out ASAP. And I did, just today: FlexWikiPad version 0.93.1 is available &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=104906&amp;amp;package_id=112894&amp;amp;release_id=262421"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I think I got all the bad bugs that I know about. I certainly did a better job of testing this time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were about three different bugs that I had to address, but the worst one by far was a bit subtle. You see, users were experiencing actual &lt;strong&gt;crashes&lt;/strong&gt; of the application when creating a new namespace. This was surprising to me because I had used &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/06/13/1455.aspx"&gt;this technique&lt;/a&gt; to catch unhandled exceptions. In my handler, I display a dialog box giving the user a chance to email me an exception report, and once they have, I let them go back to the application. In all the months I've been developing FlexWikiPad, this has always worked well enough to let me save my work whenever I hit some sort of unexpected problem. In other words, this was the first real “Oh *&amp;amp;%$ I lost work“ crash I'd seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symptoms looked something like this: an unhandled exception would be thrown, after which the dialog would be displayed. The dialog would work fine (i.e. I could email myself an exception report), and then &lt;em&gt;boom&lt;/em&gt;! The application would go down hard, with Application.Run() throwing an SEHException. This happens when someone in unmanaged code receives the dreaded COM HRESULT 0x80004005 (E_FAIL). This is a number I know well, but had hoped never to see again in my life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a look at the code I've added to the application recently. On a whim, I tried removing from my Main the innocuous-looking line: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;Application.EnableVisualStyles();&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sure enough, the problems went away. Which is to say, exceptions caused by bugs would still be thrown, but now they could be handled by my handler without an SEHException ensuing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, that line now looks like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#008000" face="Courier New"&gt;// Application.EnableVisualStyles();&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't say I understand why this change would fix the problem. EnableVisualStyles is the call you issue to ensure that you get support for Windows XP-style visual styles. Personally, I think they should have called it EnableUselessVisualFluff, but that's just me. A user requested it, so I wanted to try to support it. Of course, choosing between this and application stability was a pretty easy call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's really weird is that I just now compiled the source for version 0.93 to try to play around with this a bit, to see if I could maybe move the call around in Main to see what it would do. And now I can't get it to fail again. &lt;em&gt;Sigh&lt;/em&gt;. Don't you just love software? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, FlexWikiPad appears to be stable again. Download and enjoy. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>13</thr:total></entry><entry><id>2001</id><published>2004-08-22T16:12:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-08-22T16:12:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: FlexWikiPad 0.93.1 Released - EnableVisualStyles Suspect</title><content type="html">Craig,

And it also explains one of the errors I think you mentioned (on IM) that you saw - I think you mentioned one that was related to SxS application contexts.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;What Application.EnableVisualStyles does is it creates a new application context. Application contexts are a SxS feature. This is relevant to visual styles because the only way to enable visual styles in Windows XP is to be running in an SxS application context that is configured to load the latest version of the common controls DLL.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Of course the problem for the Application.EnableVisualStyles API is that your application is already up and running by the time it is called, so it's too late to configure the SxS context. So what it does is it creates a new one, and moves your thread into that.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;There are two complications. First, it defers the actual creation of the relevant SxS context until the creation of the message pump. (Lots of Windows Forms init is done at that point in time.) This is why calling Application.DoEvents is the standard hack. Second, you can sometimes end up with some components having been loaded *before* this init happens, meaning you end up with some DLLs bound to the old context and some to the new, resulting in a horrible mixture of old and new styles...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This tends to happen as a result of the class level init done at JIT compile time. So this kind of code:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;  static void Main()
&lt;br /&gt;  {
&lt;br /&gt;    Application.EnableVisualStyles();
&lt;br /&gt;    Application.DoEvents();
&lt;br /&gt;    Form f = new Form();
&lt;br /&gt;    Application.Run(f);
&lt;br /&gt;  }
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;will usually run the static init for the Form class (and the transitive closure of any types referred to in any fields it may have) *before* Main starts to run.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So this is usually better:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;  static void Main()
&lt;br /&gt;  {
&lt;br /&gt;    Application.EnableVisualStyles();
&lt;br /&gt;    Application.DoEvents();

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&amp;lt;foo:bar xmlns:foo="uri"&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;blah ... /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;blah ... /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/foo:bar&amp;gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is to say, with an outermost element that's namespace qualified, but with all other elements belonging to no namespace. This is primarily laziness - I type a lot of XML by hand, and write a lot of XPath, and both are slightly easier with this sort of XML. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I got burned today was in trying to write a set of types that deserialize this XML. I started with this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;[XmlRoot("foo", Namespace="uri")]&lt;br /&gt;public class Foo {&lt;br /&gt;  private BlahCollection blahs = new BlahCollection(); &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  [XmlElement("blah")]&lt;br /&gt;  public BlahCollection Blahs {&lt;br /&gt;    get { return blahs; }&lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I expected it would work just fine. But I was surprised to find that when I did the deserialization, I got zero blahs in the resulting collection, even though there were two in the file. After banging my head against this problem for quite some time, I finally realized I needed to do something like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;[XmlRoot("foo", Namespace="uri")]&lt;br /&gt;public class Foo {&lt;br /&gt;  private BlahCollection blahs = new BlahCollection(); &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  [XmlElement("blah", &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Namespace=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;""&lt;/font&gt;)]&lt;br /&gt;  public BlahCollection Blahs {&lt;br /&gt;    get { return blahs; }&lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I'm explicitly setting the namespace to the empty string. Apparently, what was happening was that without this explicit command, the [XmlElement("blah")] attribute was assuming the Namespace value of the [XmlRoot] attribute above it. So at deserialization time, it was looking for an element called "blah" from the "uri" namespace, but finding one called "blah" that was from no namespace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I know I'm nothing like the first person to come across this, it isn't called out in the docs in a way that was obvious to me, so I thought I'd mention it here. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>2061</id><published>2004-08-25T14:06:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-08-25T14:06:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Namespace &amp;amp;quot;inheritance&amp;amp;quot; and XmlSerializer</title><content type="html">I don't think it can be said that in your example XML the "outermost element is namespace qualified" but the other elements belong to "no namespace".  In your example, the "blah" elements belong to their parent's namespace ("uri"), unless the "..." you show in each "blah" element overrides that (I'm guessing they don't).    
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I think what's happening, though I don't have time to verify it, is that your use of a namespace prefix on the parent means you have to do a little more work during deserialization (and serialization, assuming you except to generate XML like this programmatically instead of just by hand).

Now that I've gotten some food :-) and read your post a little closer, I see that you meant for the blah elements to have no namespace, as indicated in your first paragraph and by your providing their parent element with a prefixed namespace.  The assumption and suggestion in my first response was just wrong.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;You are quite correct that you have to explicitly clear the namespace on the Blahs member in the class in order for this to work.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This becomes even clearer after deserializing an instance of your second class, which should produce something like this:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;bar xmlns="uri"&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;blah xmlns="" ... /&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;blah xmlns="" ... /&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/bar&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Which is the same as your original XML, but without the namespace prefix.  Obviously, your version is easier to type by hand, which was your original point.

More on that later. In the meantime...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/"&gt;Ian&lt;/a&gt; has an interesting post &lt;a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2004/09/02/apicomplexity"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; about complexity in APIs. Since he doesn't have a comment facility, I can feel justified in using it as an excuse to post here instead. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part I found interesting was his analogy with cars, wherein he compares automatic and manual transmissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So the big problem is that in attempting to provide a simple abstraction, automatic transmission reduces the drivability of a car. I've found that the only way to get the best out of a car with automatic transmission is to learn what its behaviours are so you can anticipate the bad choices that it will make, and adapt your driving style to make it do the right thing. The irony is that this means you not only need to understand the underlying reality of the characteristics of the engine and gear ratios, you also need to understand how the abstraction placed on top of this works in order to be able to work around it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seen in this light, the manual transmission looks a whole lot simpler by comparison. It might have more levels, pedals and selectable options, but at least you know exactly what each control will do. There is no need to try and outsmart the abstraction simply to get it to do what you want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part that's interesting, of course, is that this is all completely subjective, and based on a rather large number of assumptions. Note, for example, “&lt;em&gt;at least you know exactly what each control will do”&lt;/em&gt;. Living on Earth as I do, I've seen plenty of counterexamples to this on the roads every day. I'm sure we all know drivers who &lt;strong&gt;still &lt;/strong&gt;can't operate a clutch properly, for all they've been driving one for years. And frankly, I think I'd rather the cell-phone-jabbering-morons of the world have that extra hand free. But for drivers like Ian, more precise control (probably) means more safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is a way to say that the same interface can simultaneously be simpler and more complex, correct and incorrect, appropriate and inappropriate. It depends on the user. Which is why car companies give us a choice of manual or automatic, and why some software programs offer “expert” modes or other customizations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that I don't think Ian gets this - I'm sure he does - but after reading his piece I was left with the impression that manual transmission is superior, when in fact that just begs the definition of “superior”, which is inherently subjective. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>2130</id><published>2004-09-02T11:39:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-09-02T11:39:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Complexity is in the Eye of the Beholder</title><content type="html">Manual transmission IS superior, it's just that some people are philistines.  ;-)</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2123"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>2131</id><published>2004-09-02T12:13:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-09-02T12:13:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Complexity is in the Eye of the Beholder</title><content type="html">Heh.

The analogy still holds up: one of the reasons for providing high level abstractions is because if you can say what you want instead of how to do it, the implementor has much more freedom to make it "Just work better" for you behind the scenes.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;While the abstraction is still leaking as much as primitive manual transmissions, Ian is right; experts are better off with a low level interface. Non-experts, who couldn't leverage the low-level interface are just as well off with the higher abstraction, especially as it gives them "free upgrades".

My thesis project is aimed at this exact problem. Everyone wants a simple API, but a simple API is often too inefficient. My solution is to build a compiler that can be dynamically extended with new optimization routines. Someone could write a library with a simple API and a corresponding optimizer. When a programmer uses the simple API, the dynamic optimizer will analyze *how* they are using it and generate more efficient code that uses a more complex API. The simple API is really a domain-specific language that is optimized by an extensible compiler.

&lt;br /&gt;If I weren't so freakishly lazily, I would have been done 3 years ago.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;On a point of information, no they don't.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Right now, F1 cars have gearboxes where the gear selection is up to the driver, but the mechanical process of changing gears is automated. So they have a couple of paddles on the steering wheel, one to change up a gear and one to change down a gear. These are typically referred to as 'sequentials' and not 'automatics' - an 'automatic' gearbox is one that decides which ratio to use for you.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The sequential model arguably offers the best of both worlds - it automates what can usefully be automated, but still lets the driver choose the ratio. The fact is you can't actually build an automatic gearbox that does better than a race driver in most scenarios for the reasons I mentioned in my blog - the gearbox doesn't know what's coming up, because unlike the driver, it can't see where it's going. And even if you programmed the gearbox so it knew the exact layout of the race track, it still can't know about things like safety cars, back markers, overtaking manoeuvres, and all the other transient stuff that can necessitate a change from the gear shift patterns that would get you round an empty circuit as fast as possible.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So the driver still gets to select the ratio, but everything else is automated. So the abstraction is 'you have 7 gear ratios'. This model enables them to change gear incredibly quickly - it turns out that details such as the internal layout of the gearbox are not useful to the driver so it's OK to abstract these away. And for the most part, it's OK to abstract away the clutch too. (They do actually have the option to operate the clutch manually. That's because although this 'there are only gear ratios' abstraction is optimal for when you're moving, it's not so good for moving away from a standstill at the start of the race.)

&lt;br /&gt;There was a time when F1 gearboxes could shift up automatically - if you are simply accelerating flat out in a straight line, then it is true that an automatic gearbox can pick the optimal shift point more accurately than a human can. But that's a special case that happens to be amenable to automation; these gearboxes are referred to as  'semi automatic' because they only automate gearchanges under certain circumstances. (And the FIA chose to outlaw these for the 2004 season, which is why F1 cars no longer have this feature.)</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2123"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>2189</id><published>2004-09-06T12:35:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-09-06T12:35:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Viewing EIF Trace Service Logs</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/01/12/1164.aspx"&gt;talked here before&lt;/a&gt; about problems I've had with &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/productinfo/enterprise/eif/"&gt;EIF&lt;/a&gt;, the Microsoft Enterprise Instrumentation Framework. At the time, I thought that the bug I was seeing manifested itself as “I'm unable to open a remote logfile written by the EIF trace service.” Well, recently I had a chance to come back to this problem at my client, and after close to a week working on the problem, I finally found out that it has nothing to do with the remoteness of the files at all. Instead, it seems that because Windows 2003 and Windows XP use a different format to write the file, what's written on one system cannot be read on another. Since our webfarm runs 2003, and our desktops run XP, we were hitting the bug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real bummer is that there doesn't seem to be a way around this that doesn't involve rewriting the EIF trace service. It's really a problem with the fact that (according to Maros) the EIF trace service uses the Win32 OpenTrace/ProcessTrace APIs, and these are implemented differently on the two systems. D'oh! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sort of good news is that other sinks still work fine. So you can write events to the Windows Event Log or to WMI right out of the box no problem...just not to the high-speed trace service that they provide. And they don't give you the source to the service, either, so I can't even fix the problem myself. Sigh. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>2193</id><published>2004-09-07T06:16:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-09-07T06:16:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Viewing EIF Trace Service Logs</title><content type="html">We are working on replacing EIF with our new block from patterns &amp;amp; practices in Enterprise Library.

&lt;p&gt;Well, quietly, last week, the first publicly accessible incarnation of what we've been doing went up at &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/"&gt;http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;. We weren't supposed to spill the beans yet, but Jenfeng Zhang &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/junfeng/archive/2004/09/13/229221.aspx"&gt;broke the news&lt;/a&gt;, and we've gotten the go-ahead to blog about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a complete rewrite of the MSDN publishing engine, from the ground up; we started with zero code. Of course, you'll notice that the look-and-feel of the docs remains largely the same: most of the changes lurk beneath the surface. For example, the entire publishing process is now deeply XML-oriented. Content comes in as XML, gets processed as XML, gets stored as XML, and even gets rendered as XHTML. This is going to allow MSDN to introduce a lot more services around their extremely rich set of documents...just wait and see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, some of the changes are visible, too. You've probably noticed that the URLs are vastly improved. For example, you can now surf to &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/System.IO.Compression.GZipStream"&gt;http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/System.IO.Compression.GZipStream&lt;/a&gt; to get documentation about the new GZipStream class. We call this an alias. The “real” URL for this document is &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/zs4f0x23.aspx"&gt;http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/zs4f0x23.aspx&lt;/a&gt;, where “zs4f0x23” is what we call the &lt;em&gt;short ID&lt;/em&gt; for the doc. We did a lot of work to make sure that this identifier is stable, so that URLs won't break. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I've now finished my involvement with the project, I'm pretty excited about this release. It is the most significant (largest scale) piece of software I've ever shipped, and a lot of my code is running in it. Not that I was the primary developer, but there will be MSDN devs maintaining my code for quite some time to come. I learned a ton, not only from Tim, but from a woman named Kim Wolk without whom this software literally never would have shipped. She hates it when I mention her name, but I think she deserves more credit on this release than any other single person on the team, and it would be a crime if no one came out and pointed her out as the hero of this project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So go give it a test drive and let MSDN know what you think. It's only an alpha, so don't be too surprised if something breaks or doesn't work the way you'd expect, but take my word for it: this is a huge step forward for MSDN, and by extension, for the developers that rely on it. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>37</thr:total></entry><entry><id>2276</id><published>2004-09-15T10:25:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-09-15T10:25:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: MSDN Alpha Available</title><content type="html">For me it's great.

&lt;br /&gt;Nic: the debate over frames was a long and tough one. Fundamentally, the issue was, "How do we preserve a useful URL in the nav bar without having to reload the tree every time?"
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As far as MSDN articles, that seems like a great idea. Unfortunately, I have no control over what happens. I'll pass the idea along, though. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2274"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>2287</id><published>2004-09-15T17:35:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-09-15T17:35:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: MSDN Alpha Available</title><content type="html">From Craig: "How do we preserve a useful URL in the nav bar without having to reload the tree every time?" 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;By not using frames ;-) I can see what you would have this problem tho - there are a LOT of tree nodes in there. Maybe some other method would be good - eg, putting a search as the main navigation option, and being able to search for specific things, eg a class/namespace/property/article etc. Of course, with not having frames, google should now be able to do a much better job of indexing it ;-)
&lt;br /&gt;

I especially love the fast rendering. linking to the online docs before would take a good five seconds to show what you wanted - with this, it's _fast_!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;2) If the "alias" will never break either, I wish you'd show it in the address bar any time it's available. I'd be nice to know (for example) what the alias was to the authenticationModules element reference for the network config settings schema.  I can't even guess - if it has one.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;3)  I really like pages more like this: &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/620b4fzf.aspx" target="_new"&gt;http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/620b4fzf.aspx&lt;/a&gt; that show a description/summary under each link, rather than pages like this: &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/x53a06bb.aspx" target="_new"&gt;http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/x53a06bb.aspx&lt;/a&gt; or this: &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ed8yd1ha.aspx" target="_new"&gt;http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ed8yd1ha.aspx&lt;/a&gt;  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what the plan is with the lists (I saw at least four different styles, table, list, table with desc, list with desc), but I like the two with summaries. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And, while I know that this is a *Super* early preview of your great new site (and it is cool), I want to say this: Search is King.   Try searching for IPost - nothing. nada.  Search for IPostBackDataHandler - 121 results.  Some of the searches are great - "Regular" gives Regular Expressions as the first hit. However, "Dispose" is not usefull at all.  On the other hand, I'm impressed that the first hit for a word like "using" is exactly what I want.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to make this so long, but one more thing on the search - on the search results for, say, "Filter" I have a bundle of "Filter Property" links.  It's very difficult to see what types these properties are on!  Please make it obvious.  I'd rather see "DocumentList.Filter Propery" than "Filter Property" with "DocumentList.Filter" in tiny, tiny type at the end of a difficult to ready summary.  I can see that the search results page is a work in progress, so I have high hopes!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Very awesome - please send kudos to your team from at least one happy nearly anonymous developer!

Presumably if I navigate to .../System.IO.FileInfo I get the docs for FileInfo in the then-current version of the framework.  If I need to find out the behaviour in an older version of the framework (say, the current version is Orcas and I'm still on Whidbey), will there be a stable URL for that?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;For example it might be useful to rule that although .../ClassName.aspx goes to the current version, .../20/ClassName.aspx always goes to the Whidbey version.  Just a suggestion.

&lt;br /&gt;There is a mechanism for versioning built in to the URL scheme. I no longer have access to the code, so I can't remember exactly what it is (we changed it a lot right towards the end), but there's something like a query string parameter that you can specify to say which one you want.

That is, you'll be able to specify a "version independent" URL which takes you to the latest doc or a "version dependent" URL that takes you to a specific version. There's only one version in the system right now, so this is not yet an issue.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff! I do think that the expandable tree, while awesomely cool, affected tactile response of the site and was probably hated by most users. Getting rid of it is a good call.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;However, I think the new navigation can still be improved upon.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;1) You are creating ambiguitiy by mixing "links to content" and "content hierarchy" concepts. For instance, Click on "General Reference -&amp;gt; Configuration" files. Whoops! It's a STARGATE! We've been transported into a totally different section of the site. The easiest solution is to add an icon to differentiate which items are "links" and which are "children".
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;2) "The deeper you are, the less space you get" problem. It is simply not fair for items like "ASP.NET Configuration Sections" to have only 60% of the space than the root items. You can try to keep the tree shallow, but I am afraid the problem will always hang over your head. A while back, I've come up with a navigation schema that provides generic tree view with only 2 levels exposed at a time. It is now implemented on a dozen of sites and seems to work pretty well. Take a look:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ccc.uab.edu/" target="_new"&gt;http://www.ccc.uab.edu/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Go to "New Patients", "Support Groups and Services", "Questions about Support Groups". See how the tree "folds?". Let me know if you need more explanation.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;3) The breadcrumb is useless - it is duplicated by the tree view, which provides a lot more intuitive presentation. Ditch it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;HTML code is not bad, but can still be worked on:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;1) Eliminate useless ids in HTML elements. I estimate that you could probably save a couple of grands in traffic costs if you take them out.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;2) Move embedded styles into the separate CSS file. Speaking of embedded styles, you will have a much cleaner HTML if you preserve the hierarchy of the TOC in your HTML, rather than calculate margin offset for each level. If your child topics are nested within each parent topic (using UL element, hopefully), you only will need to specify margin once.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;3) I see that you guys use XSLT to render HTML. Take a look at "exclude-result-prefixes" attribute of the stylesheet element. It will help you strip out the xmlns:msdn namespace declarations -- you don't need them. Again, I just saved MSDN a couple of grand in monthly traffic costs. Hey, maybe I need start getting kick backs or something? :)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;4) When ratings and page tools first came out, it was acceptable to retrofit them into the old system using IFRAMES. But for the new design? Come on.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Let me know if you need any help in getting those done. I will more than happy to assists with any changes that I suggested.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2274"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>2328</id><published>2004-09-17T22:33:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-09-17T22:33:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: MSDN Alpha Available</title><content type="html">One major request of mine is to allow the left menu and the top MSDN header bar to be collapsed for a "clean" view.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the highlight boxes around the TOC content overlap when a line is wrapped (which is a lot in Fx). This is what red_avni was talking about, and I can confirm his fix.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, the style used for code blocks isn't working properly. The whole code sample is running together as a single (wrapped) line.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;It looks like the culprit is :
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;pre
&lt;br /&gt;{
&lt;br /&gt;/*	margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; */
&lt;br /&gt;	white-space:normal;
&lt;br /&gt;	word-wrap:break-word;
&lt;br /&gt;	word-break:break-all;
&lt;br /&gt;}
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Why is that "white-space:normal;"? Shouldn't it be "pre"? I used the DOM Inspector to change it to "pre" and it all displayed fine.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Good work, though. Like I say, this looks nice. Is any of the legacy content going to be migrated?

&lt;br /&gt;I'd still go ahead and make suggestions: they do get read, and they do influence how people think inside MSFT. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2361"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>2448</id><published>2004-09-28T04:17:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-09-28T04:17:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">FlexWiki Available on SourceForge</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Finally, finally, finally, &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; has completed its long transition from its old home at &lt;a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com"&gt;GotDotNet&lt;/a&gt; to its &lt;a href="http://sf.net/projects/flexwiki"&gt;new home at SourceForge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dornstein/"&gt;David Ornstein&lt;/a&gt; - the father of FlexWiki - has a &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dornstein/archive/2004/09/27/235042.aspx"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; talking about it from his perspective. Here's mine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way back in February or March, I &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/03/24/1271.aspx"&gt;became disillusioned&lt;/a&gt; with the state of affairs at GotDotNet. I'd been working a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; on my tools &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FlexWikiPad"&gt;FlexWikiPad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FwSync"&gt;FwSync&lt;/a&gt;, and wrestling with the GDN tooling was becoming so annoying that it was starting to make me dread working on my stuff. So, I took matters into my own hands and moved my code to &lt;a href="http://sf.net"&gt;SourceForge&lt;/a&gt;, which I'd found much easier to work with. Not perfect, but better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I was still contributing to FlexWiki itself. Since that code was still on GDN, I started to agitate for a move to SourceForge. Why? Because I wanted it to be easier for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. :) But I also truly believed that it was a better place for FlexWiki to grow, and that the other developers would find the experience better, too. Of course, that was selfishly motivated as well, because more people working on it means more cool features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Ornstein was &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dornstein/archive/2004/09/27/235042.aspx"&gt;thinking along the same lines&lt;/a&gt; at the time, so we started to work together. Because I was complaining the loudest, I felt an obligation to help, particularly because I'd set up or help set up a &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/explosionman/"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fwcontrib/"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dasblog2dottext/"&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; on SourceForge before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus began the long, long process of moving to SourceForge. For me, it was pretty easy, because my tasks were mostly technical: I'm the buildmaster for FlexWiki now, so I wrote a build script and set up a &lt;a href="http://ccnet.thoughtworks.com"&gt;CruiseControl.NET&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html"&gt;Continous Integration&lt;/a&gt; server at &lt;a href="http://builds.flexwiki.com"&gt;http://builds.flexwiki.com&lt;/a&gt;. David's part was much harder; in addition to the technical tasks that he took on, he had to convince Microsoft (his employer) to allow this to happen. Since FlexWiki is only Microsoft's third open source project (after &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix"&gt;WiX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wtl"&gt;WTL&lt;/a&gt;), it was a very big deal, involving much coordination on David's part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it took months. This was highly frustrating for many people, but particularly so for would-be FlexWiki contributors. Several of them emailed me periodically saying, “When will the move be done?“ To which I could only respond: “Soon.“ Before long, it became obvious to me that I should switch that to the more truthful, “We don't know, but we're still working on it.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But last night, at long last, all the legal documents had been signed, all the crucial technical details had been taken care of, the &lt;a href="http://news.com.com/2100-7344_3-5384769.html"&gt;CNET article&lt;/a&gt; posted, and the word came down: the &lt;a href="http://sf.net/projects/flexwiki"&gt;FlexWiki project site&lt;/a&gt; is now live. We've even got a release posted that has a few new features, like better support for Firefox. Plus, with continuous integration set up and (hopefully) working, I think we can more easily and frequently release contributions to the public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, we're definitely hoping that we can once again rally the FlexWiki development community, which has languished while David and I (mostly David) were working to get things transitioned. We'd particularly like to focus on bugfixes for a while - a fair number of defects have been logged but not addressed. There's still a fair amount of administrative work to do, too, like moving the bugs from the wiki where they live now to the SourceForge tracker where we'd like them to be. But we are finally blocked only by technical issues, which are the ones we know how to solve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the questions I expect people will ask is, “How do I get involved?“ To start with, join either the &lt;a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/flexwiki-users"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/flexwiki-devs"&gt;developers&lt;/a&gt; mailing list, according to your inclinations. If you're of a developing mind, grab the source code and start poking around. Just be aware that we're going to be fairly careful with handing out write access - David talks about that more in his &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dornstein/archive/2004/09/27/235042.aspx"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and one exciting thing I almost forgot to mention: &lt;a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham"&gt;Ward Cunningham&lt;/a&gt; is a member of the FlexWiki project. Ward quite literally invented wikis, so we're really happy to have him involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second major software release for me in as many weeks (the other being the &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/09/15/2274.aspx"&gt;MSDN Alpha&lt;/a&gt;), so it's a very exciting time for me. Unlike MSDN, though, I'm still very much a part of the FlexWiki effort. I'm sure we'll have a lot to do as people start to stretch the new system and we figure out how to run things, but I'm looking forward to it! &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>2457</id><published>2004-09-28T09:26:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-09-28T09:26:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">FlexWiki moves to SourceForge</title><content type="html">FlexWiki moves to SourceForge</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2448"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>2458</id><published>2004-09-28T09:30:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-09-28T09:30:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">FlexWiki Goes the Way of SourceForge</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2448"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>2467</id><published>2004-09-28T18:36:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-09-28T18:36:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">GDN Workspaces Vs.

We were using it at one of my clients for quite some time to log all of our errors to various places. But recently we started experiencing massive slowdowns that I was unable to rectify, but that seemed to be attributable to EIF initialization. Some of our unit tests went from taking 5 seconds to taking 50 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably would have worked longer to fix it, but at the same time we were facing some serious configuration issues with EIF as well. Specifically, we were trying to instrument our code to record a pair of start/stop log messages for each method, which we could turn on or off at runtime based on our need for diagnostic information. While EIF certainly supports this, its configuration mechanism requires that we then list the name of every method in the EIF config file. While possible, that was impractical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to see what it would take to switch to &lt;a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/index.html"&gt;log4net&lt;/a&gt;. As it turned out, it only took one day. I'd isolated most of the logging code already, so I just had to change things in one place. And at the end of it, I was much happier. Not only does log4net appear to do pretty much the same things as EIF, it appears to be faster (although the jury is still out), it appears to be easier to extend, and it is &lt;strong&gt;definitely&lt;/strong&gt; easier to configure. The last point is an important one for us - log4net has a hierarchical configuration scheme, meaning we can set defaults at the root and have them propagate to all our logging statements, rather than having to set them explicitly, as we do with EIF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying EIF is bad, mind you. It could be that I was doing things wrong. I know that Microsoft is overhauling it, so maybe their next version will be better. log4net does have a head start, being a port of log4j, which has been around for a long time. But for now, log4net meets &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; needs better...your mileage may vary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a decent &lt;a href="http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=27317"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on theserverside.net that goes more in depth, but here are what I found to be the major differences: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease of use&lt;/strong&gt;. log4net felt easier to get started with. That might have been because I had already used EIF. The two are fairly similar. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typed vs. untyped.&lt;/strong&gt; log4net is “untyped“ in the sense that you log strings. In EIF, you log typed objects. This turns out largely to be a philosophical distinction except for: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensibility.&lt;/strong&gt; Because log4net allows you to attach arbitrary name-value pairs to a logging thread (they call this MDCs), it's actually easier to extend. In EIF, the reliance on strongly-typed object hierarchies means I have to extend their schema. That turns out to be difficult for a variety of reasons. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manageability. &lt;/strong&gt;Like I said, the fact that log4net lets you inherit log settings down a hierarchy of loggers makes it easier to manage a large application. EIF, by contrast is “flat“, and forces you to manage every log source independently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, I found the two pieces of software to be very, very similar. Which means I'd generally choose log4net in the future. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>23</thr:total></entry><entry><id>2481</id><published>2004-09-29T15:33:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-09-29T15:33:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: From EIF to log4net</title><content type="html">We made the same decision around log4net.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;We've set it up so that when we log a message, we set the logger to the full method name, like 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Craig.Foo.Bar.SomeMethod
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Because log4net recognizes dots as separators, this allows us to turn things on/off at the Craig level, the Craig.Foo level, the Craig.Foo.Bar level, etc.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, my question was, how to achieve this in EIF ? I don't wanna write .Raise() Event all over my production code. 
&lt;br /&gt;In EIF, if i just place the fully qualified method name in the enterpriseinstrumentation.config can the event be raised ?

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As far as recording messages, both EIF and log4net require that you call Raise() or Log() for every message that you want to produce. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;You can probably achieve this using an aspect weaver, custom compiler, or .NET remoting sink, but I don't know much about any of those approaches...and what I do know, I don't like. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I think you should get bite the bullet and instrument your code. Encapsulate what you're doing in a helper method, and you can get the code down to one line, but it's still going to have to be in every method. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2473"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>5467</id><published>2005-01-26T09:26:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-01-26T09:26:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: From EIF to log4net</title><content type="html">Real Ugly() and that is what I'm affraid off.
&lt;br /&gt;why can't these guys simply read the config and see any entry for class.method() and raise an event ? After all they are flowing the context along ? 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I have evaluated AOP, method interceptor etc. all but everything needs atleast an attribute to be placed on these methods, which makes the entire purpose useless !
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I wonder how the ANTS Profiler or Intel VTUNE dynamically gets the method interception ?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Thanks anyhow for your inputs.

How would you write it if you were them? 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;ANTS and VTune use the .NET profiling API, which is one way to inject code, but it's really hard to do it this way. The profiler itself has to be unmanaged, and the parts of it you'd need to do method injection would need to be written in assembly, with the resultant high chance of major bugs. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;One option is for you to do manipulation of your source files as part of the compilation process, injecting logging method calls. It's ugly, but you're trying to solve a hard problem. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'm a bit surprised to hear that there are no AOP solutions that don't require method attribution. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2473"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>5470</id><published>2005-01-26T10:38:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-01-26T10:38:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: From EIF to log4net</title><content type="html">I'm expecting (I may be wrong) just exactly like trace=true in aspx pages which turns the trace on.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I guess it is a compiler job. when u see an entry in the config file for a class.method() you just add a trace call to the start and end of the method. After all the compiler knows the workflow ! 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;as u finally suggest, that is what i'm planning to do, injecting logging calls. but don't know how to start ! 
&lt;br /&gt;any pointers would be great.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Yes AOP is still not that mature ! either attribute or you have to derive from ContextBoundObject !

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As for how to instrument your source, I'd have a look at some of the profilers out there. At least one of them is a source code instrumenter.

&lt;br /&gt;during the course (accidently) I found answer to my query on my Computer !
&lt;br /&gt;It is under ProgramFiles\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\SDK\v1.1\Tool Developers Guide\docs\Profiling.doc 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;There is also the samples folder which has C++ source code, of how to enable managed code profiling ! That's fantastic .
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'm in the process of compiling and testing the code (needs platform SDK) and I checked the next version (Whidbey) has much better support for Code/Memory Profiling.

&lt;br /&gt;A matter of personal taste, obviously.

&lt;br /&gt;It's also interesting to see that the diskmon light comes on sometimes when the disk tray one doesn't.

Well, tonight I shipped the first release of the Wangdera Control suite. If you &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=117783&amp;amp;package_id=132545&amp;amp;release_id=274791"&gt;download Wangdera.Controls.dll&lt;/a&gt;, what you'll get is two Windows Forms controls: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RichTextBox2 - &lt;/strong&gt;extends the Windows Forms RichTextBox control to allow you to do more types of formatting, as well as giving you a way to apply a whole bunch of formatting all at once in an efficient way. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RichTextEditor &lt;/strong&gt;- extends RichTextBox2 with autocomplete lists and enhanced change notification. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm particularly excited about RichTextEditor, because autocomplete lists plus decent change notification plus advanced styling mean it's a pretty good basis for building simple (and perhaps not-so-simple) IDEs. I've already used it at work to write a lightweight SQL statement editor that turns keywords blue and strings green. I call it RichTextEditor not because I mean for it to edit Rich Text, but because I mean for it to be a text editor with rich display capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote RichTextEditor with a particular goal in mind. You probably know that I've been working on &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FlexWikiPad"&gt;FlexWikiPad&lt;/a&gt; for close to a year now. I've been using the &lt;a href="http://sf.net/projects/scintilla"&gt;scintilla&lt;/a&gt; control in it until now, via the &lt;a href="http://www.freelists.org/archives/scintillanet/"&gt;ScintillaNET&lt;/a&gt; wrapper that makes it usable from .NET. For the most part, it's a pretty solid component, but I've always found the API to be a bit weird. And lately I've started to rub up against the edges of the styling model...nothing I couldn't work around, but it would make me do some stuff in a way I don't like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before running off to reinvent the wheel, though, I poked around a bit to see if I could find something else. The &lt;a href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/"&gt;#develop&lt;/a&gt; IDE has an open source text editor component, but it's GPL, and that would make it hard for me to use in the places I want to use it. So I started looking at RichTextBox. It &lt;strong&gt;almost&lt;/strong&gt; worked, and I figured if I could just tweak one or two things...two months later here I am, a shiny new invention I call “the wheel“ in my hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have just rolled RichTextEditor into the FlexWikiPad code, but I thought that this is the sort of thing that other people would want to use standalone. Hence the release in the Wangdera.Controls package. If you have a use for it, give it a try and let me know about any &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=117783&amp;amp;atid=679446"&gt;bugs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=117783&amp;amp;atid=679449"&gt;feature requests&lt;/a&gt; you might have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan from here is to start integrating RichTextEditor into FlexWikiPad, while at the same time completely overhauling the formatting engine in FWP. I think I can increase performance, increase flexibility, and increase capabilities all in one go. Well see, of course; RichTextEditor works well enough in my tests but the true test is employing it in a real world application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a screenshot of the sample app I include with the Wangdera.Controls package. It shows some of the capabilities of RichTextEditor: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;As far as using an HTML rendering engine instead, I think that's a great idea. Why does it need to be fully managed, though? Every single control in WinForms is interop to an unmanaged piece of code, and that seems to work well enough. Also, do you think that an HTML-based engine would give you a reasonable way to enter and edit text, as you would do in scenarios where you're building an IDE?

As a developer of smart client apps, that's pretty much out for us. We'd have to spool down a ~9mb interop DLL, via HTTP, to every client at least once.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Like any self-respecting developer, I hate my users, but not that much. Yet.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I guess what I object to most is that we have *one* option, IE interop, and that sucks. Having two or three different HTML rendering engines I could access from .NET code would be nice, even if they were all interop-y.

A few observations, though: 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;1) Having looked at the source code a bit, it appears to me that this is entirely an interop wrapper around IE. 
&lt;br /&gt;2) It doesn't provide intellisense-type popup error handling, which I need. 
&lt;br /&gt;3) It doesn't seem to provide a way to handle clicking on a link, which I also need. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;#1 isn't much of a concern for my usage in FlexWikiPad. #2 &amp;amp; #3 are must-haves. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Since there's no way I'm going to work on a GotDotNet project again, and since I just experienced first-hand what it takes to move a GDN project to SourceForge, I'm in a bit of a quandry. I'd like to see if I can get Lutz's thing to work, since using an HTML-based editor makes waaay more sense in FlexWikiPad than an RTF-based one. But I need for the licensing to work out so I can basically take his code, modify it, and re-release it under the CPL. The problem is, I'm not sure that the Shared Source license allows for that. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Looks like I'll need to contact Lutz and see what we can work out. Unless someone out there can interpret the GDN license for me? </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2760"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>2815</id><published>2004-10-15T07:13:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-10-15T07:13:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: RichTextEditor</title><content type="html">One quick question: does this support text wrapping?

&lt;br /&gt;If you have the syntax highlighting on, paste a large amount of text in the control such that you are scrolling.  When you type into the control(not on the top line) it will either scroll your cursor to the top if nothing is highlighted, or it will try to scroll towards the last syntax highlited text while keeping your cursor on screen.

I've been using &lt;a href="http://winmerge.sourceforge.net"&gt;WinMerge&lt;/a&gt; for a few months, and have been mostly happy with it. It doesn't do three-way merge, but hey, it works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the other day I ran across &lt;a href=" http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/"&gt;KDiff3&lt;/a&gt; (which is free, same as WinMerge), and I like it a whole lot better. But some of the features it has that make me like it better than WinMerge: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports three-way merge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports directory merges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seems to be faster than WinMerge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will word wrap long lines at your option&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think the nicest feature is that it shows you not just what lines differ, but actually what's different in those lines. That's really handy for long lines, or for those times where you're diffing an XML file that has no linebreaks in it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the downside, it's harder to use and uglier than WinMerge - it's clearly a developer power tool. Since I'm a developer, I don't mind. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>15</thr:total></entry><entry><id>2788</id><published>2004-10-14T08:48:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-10-14T08:48:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: KDiff3 - a new favorite</title><content type="html">Have you checked out Beyond Compare?</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2787"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>2789</id><published>2004-10-14T08:56:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-10-14T08:56:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: KDiff3 - a new favorite</title><content type="html">I've heard good things about it, but I haven't checked it out.

&lt;br /&gt;because of the license of quality.

In fact, that was one of the reasons I wrote FWP in the first place, as an excuse to see what the fuss about TDD was. It turned out to be a huge win for FWP, and I've been using it for everything I write since then. Until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent a good chunk of my free time in the last two months writing &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/10/12/2760.aspx"&gt;RichTextEditor&lt;/a&gt;, my first real WinForms control, I slammed headlong into a problem that many others have had before me: writing a test-driven component that has a complex relationship with its container. You see, the main tenet of TDD is based on the idea that you simulate the client of a component before you write the component. These simulations usually take the form of method calls, since usually what you're testing is a simple algorithmic class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes what you're testing is a little more complicated, like a form. In cases like that, testing gets a bit more complicated too, because now you have to simulate a user clicking buttons and entering text. But even that isn't that bad if you separate out the windowy bits of the application (the view) from the bits that react to it (the controller). Then you just test the controller by making calls that simulate events in the view. That's how FlexWikiPad is developed, and I've been very happy with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, what you're testing is a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; more complicated, like a WinForms control. There, the thing we have to simulate is the windowing system itself, since that's really the client of my control: Windows sends events to my control, and my control sends painting commands back. Making matters worse, at the time I didn't even &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what messages to expect, and what should happen in response to them. As a result, I found myself at a loss to write tests for my control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I didn't. I tested it the old fashioned way: manually. Was it more error-prone? Yes. Does it make bug regression more difficult? Yes. Did I have any other choice given my time and resource constraints? Not really. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note, however, what I am &lt;strong&gt;not &lt;/strong&gt;saying here: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That TDD doesn't work. It actually works very well when simulating the container isn't too hard. Which is most of the time. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That TDD doesn't work in GUI scenarios. I've used it very succesfully when building applications. Just not RichTextEditor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That TDD never works for control development. The limiting factor is being able to simulate the exchange of messages between Windows and your control. If this is complex, at some point simulating it will be too much work. But if it's simple, you might manage it just fine. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That you can't use TDD at all if you're writing a complex control. I actually still used it in RichTextEditor to develop the undo/redo logic of my control, since that stuff is decoupled from the rest of the control, and has a simple interface. It was very helpful for that portion of the development. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing to be aware of is that I never really explored automating my testing process in other ways. For example. a macro recorder could be used to send keystrokes to my control, and possibly to test the results in one way or another. &lt;a href="http://nunitforms.sourceforge.net/"&gt;NUnitForms&lt;/a&gt; has a Recorder that might help in this regard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I'm still a huge fan of TDD, and still plan to use it whenever I can. It's just that now I have a better idea of what “whenever I can” means. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>30</thr:total></entry><entry><id>2857</id><published>2004-10-17T20:00:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-10-17T20:00:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">TDD Is Great...Except When It Isn't</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2852"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>2859</id><published>2004-10-18T01:58:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-10-18T01:58:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: TDD Is Great...Except When It Isn't</title><content type="html">I think you hit the nail on the head when you mentioned other ways of testing - after all, it is TDD not UTDD (unit test driven development).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;One approach I started to use in my previous project was to have lots of ASSERTs, a debug/trace listener that I could query against, and use a record/playback technique (in my case the John Robbins "Tester" utility that was presented over the course of a number of BugSlayer articles). The nominal case is tested by running and checking the specialised log listener recorded no errors or warnings, then as you go along you can test for error conditions by recording appropriate usage, then adding playback and checking into the test script.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This is clearly not unit testing (system? smoke? integration?), but I'd still say the development was test-driven.

One of the main reasons I didn't go this route was that when I started that particular project, I was just playing around. I could have gone back and retrofitted it, but I was lazy. :) 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In any event, I still believe that there are cases where container-component interaction is so complex that any sort of TDD will start to get very expensive. For example, trying to test logic that ensures a particular piece of text got drawn at x, y location 25, 168 and has a red wavy underline with a solid, one-pixel border might get a little hairy. It's not that it can't be done, it's that it starts to be a net-zero or net-loss proposition. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But as I said, I still believe in testing as much as you can. You seem to have found a way to automate testing of a large part of your app, which is a good thing. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2852"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>2872</id><published>2004-10-18T07:22:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-10-18T07:22:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Test Driven Development - a tough nut to crack?</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2852"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>2896</id><published>2004-10-19T13:34:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-10-19T13:34:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: TDD Is Great...Except When It Isn't</title><content type="html">If the container is that difficult to simulate, why not use the real thing? Have your testing code load your control in a WinForm and play with it (causing events and calling methods to verify that everything stays consistent).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, that doesn't allow you to test whether the control sends the right events to its host control but at least you can get pretty extensive test coverage on your own code without tripping on your inevitably imperfect fake host. I say that's better than nothing.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I agree with you, when the container is complex it becomes very labor-intensive to test your component. Extreme example: my boss actually wants us to implement the entire MAPI specification in order to test our MAPI component (a MAPI Message Store Provider).

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The only way you can *hope* to fully test a gui is to create a model (finite state machine) that represents the different possibilities of interactions and then execute that model.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I do agree on automation, but I disagree with Jonathan's proposal. Well, I very much agree with the state machine approach as part of the QA process (the state machine would presumably be built of use cases) but that's not really the developer's unit testing anymoree, is it? 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I think a possible answers is actually on one of Jonathan's blogs (&lt;a href="http://blog.dotnetwiki.org/archive/2004/06/10/390.aspx" target="_new"&gt;http://blog.dotnetwiki.org/archive/2004/06/10/390.aspx&lt;/a&gt;)and it is going back to more of a white box testing scenarion on the control, by using a Reflector Addin to generate empty test case. I did something like this manually before NUnitForms came back from hibernation, and probably can go back to it using Reflector.

I think it's pretty well recognized that both are useful tools in developing quality software. Long-running tests are probably the domain of the test team, rather than the developers, as adding "two hours" to every developer build is not feasible. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;State machine development seems to my inexperienced eyes to be a tool primarily useful for the test team, with the impact to the dev team being *perhaps* to modify their code to make it easier for the test team to inspect application state.

However, as was pointed out above, you might be doing test-driven development without doing *automated unit test* driven development. Automated unit tests imply that you have to simulate your client/caller, which can be quite complex. Complex enough to stop you from doing it? Depends on your situation. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I should also point out that I didn't mean to imply in any way that developers are absolved from writing all the tests they can. Rather, that we should remember that enlisting the test team to write simulations and automation for more complex scenarios - since they have the tools and expertise to do it - is a good idea. It's just about division of labor, not passing the buck. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As widely available tools mature (e.g. NUnitAsp, NUnitForms), the cost of automation by the developer will continue to drop, and the test team can shift their focus to even more complex scenarios. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2852"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>4890</id><published>2005-01-11T02:57:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-01-11T02:57:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: TDD Is Great...Except When It Isn't</title><content type="html">You might want to check out a mock type solution.

I think you are just trying to go with the "i don't have time to test" or "it's to much effort to test". If your job depended on it, you would for sure do whatever it takes to test. In the end, supporting usercontrols is pain and the time invested in testing the code would for sure be worth the investment, no doubt.

It is such a similar discussion to the one you can hear about data access and SQL.

The problem with Windows Forms is, as Craig says, that it's very hard to know what messages to expect, or how you're supposed to respond to them. (It inherits this problem directly from Win32 - Windows Forms is really just a .NET wrapper around the classic Win32 windowing APIs.)

The key to avoiding this in WPF is data binding. Every time I have to use any other UI technology (whether it's rich client or something web based) I'm reminded of just how good WPF data binding is. (It's easy to forget while using it because it just works.) However, this is not a great answer to your question, because this knowledge alone won't help you.

You will hear experienced WPF (and also Silverlight) developers bang on about MVVM - the Model View ViewModel technique. This is more or less a variation on the common MVP (Model View Presenter) pattern, but one specifically adapted to use data binding. And the reason we sound like a broken record on this topic is that it's the best pattern we've found yet for enabling TDD in WPF applications.

I gather you're specifically looking to apply TDD in a graphical application, where you need things like draggable handles for resizing. The approach I'd take here is to understand that you can use databinding to control the location (and size, and any visible attribute) of elements on screen. For that matter, you can use list binding (any ItemsControl-derived element) to arrange for UI elements to be created and destroyed entirely through data binding. The reason this matters is that you can write tests that ask simple questions like "If a drag is in progress, and the mouse moves, does the dragged item move with the mouse?". For input, the best approach is usually to have the ViewModel expose methods that correspond directly to events you'd handle in the codebehind, such as MouseDown, MouseMove etc - your codebehind handlers for these would just call myViewModel.MouseMove(e.GetPosition(this)); or something similar. This means it's dead easy for a test to fake up mouse input - you just call the same methods the event handlers would. And then your test merely has to inspect properties to see if the expected results happen - look at the properties to which you'd bind, say, the Canvas.X and Canvas.Y properties in order to answer questions of the form "Did this element move where it was supposed to?"

Some people go further and try to eliminate all code from the codebehind. I think that's worth doing if you're not distorting your code to make it happen. It's certainly an excellent goal for simple data entry form UI. Using ICommand works pretty well for simple one shot actuation (e.g., clicking a button). I think it's harder to achieve with direct interaction (i.e., creating UI elements that the user can interact with directly using the mouse, in ways that are not supported by built-in controls). At that point I think it's probably OK to have simple one-liner event handlers. (There are other approaches, but they often end up being more complicated. E.g., Blend behaviours can enable codebehind-free implementation of more complex interactions, but I think the conceptual overhead of introducing a custom Blend-style behaviour may outweight the benefits, unless it's a thing that you end up using in at least a couple of places in your code.)

One of the big challenges for TDD and complex UI interactions is the fact that you will end up wanting to test numerous variations on a theme. You can end up with an explosion of setup code. I.e. the "when" bit of your test ends up being complex, and the "...this should happen" part is trivial. And this becomes problematic as you need to setup loads of tiny variations around the same idea. There are two useful techniques for managing that. One is simply to remember that your test code is just as deserving of constant refactoring, rethinking, and general maintenance as your production code - in interaction code (much more than domain model code) I tend to find that my tests end up needing non-trivial object models of their own. And the other thing to be aware of is that a handful of unit test frameworks can provide parameterised tests - a way of writing at test once, and then automatically running tens, hundreds or even thousands of variations on it. (In practice, you tend to want to test edge cases, and the cases just around the edges, and once you've got a few dimensions of variability, it's surprising how many variations you want to run just to handle all the corner cases.)

Fundamentally, the issue is that complex, bespoke interaction models entail a surprising amount of context, and need to deal with a lot of minor variations. Tooling that can deal with that can help you. I've been using MbUnit recently, for example. It has its flaws, but it's relatively good at this particular aspect of testing.

Doubtless some people would argue that the need for this sort of thing is a flaw in the model, and a symptom of code that needs to be separated out into smaller pieces. But I'm not so sure - fundamentally, the problem is that the end user stories are very much more complicated when you're looking at the details of direct user interaction than they are when dealing with the actual task at hand. (E.g., "Add a new curve to a diagram" is a useful and important level of abstraction to have, but it is an order of magnitude simpler than the level of abstraction at which you concern yourself with the interactive process of drawing that curve...but the interactive process is not obviously subject to reduction - it's one self-contained, bounded, and surprisingly complex thing.)

Anyway, I'm rambling. Frankly, there's no substitute for experience, so you're going to have to try some things out and see what works for you. In my experience, different projects require different approaches in any case. So I'll stop there. I hope some of that was useful and/or interesting.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2852"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>100774</id><published>2011-07-10T01:42:45.0-05:00</published><updated>2011-07-10T01:42:45.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: TDD Is Great...Except When It Isn't</title><content type="html">Thanks Ian, I wish that your explanations are supported with little examples, or links, it could be more thorough, as its a complex issue indeed.

Right now, we do this as a partly manual process - we've got a simple script that downloads the WSDL from a set of web services we've developed, then generates the default proxies by running &lt;em&gt;wsdl.exe&lt;/em&gt; against them. Then we make some simple hand edits against them to make them look how we want them to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two problems with this process: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It requires hand editing the files every time we want to make a change. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The turnaround sucks - we have to deploy the web service somewhere before we can get the WSDL. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one I'll fix later. It's pretty easy to do right now, since most of the changes are just removing code. At some point I'll cobble together some sort of &lt;em&gt;sed&lt;/em&gt; script or something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second one is sort of a pain at the moment, though. We're using Continuous Integration, which is great because it means every time someone makes a change, we get a fully tested and installed version of the product running on a web farm about twenty minutes later. But because that's currently the only way we have of deploying (setup is somewhat complex), it means that if someone adds a [WebMethod], they have to wait 20 minutes for the deployment before they can download the wsdl and update the custom proxies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be pretty nice if instead there was some way to generate WSDL directly from the web service assemblies. Well, after poking around a bit with &lt;a href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/"&gt;Reflector&lt;/a&gt;, and with a little help from &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/default.aspx"&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt;, I'd figured out the incredibly easy code to do exactly this. Assuming you have a web service class called MyService, the following code will spew the WSDL for it to the command line: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;ServiceDescriptionReflector reflector = &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;new&lt;/font&gt; ServiceDescriptionReflector(); &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;reflector.Reflect(&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;typeof&lt;/font&gt;(MyService), "http://localhost/vdir/Foo.asmx"); &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;if&lt;/font&gt; (reflector.ServiceDescriptions.Count &amp;gt; 1){&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;throw&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;new&lt;/font&gt; Exception("Deal with multiple service descriptions later");&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;XmlTextWriter wtr = &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;new&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Courier New"&gt; XmlTextWriter(Console.Out); &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Courier New"&gt;wtr.Formatting = Formatting.Indented; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;reflector.ServiceDescriptions[0].Write(wtr); &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;wtr.Close(); &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;The URL that appears in the call to &lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt; is not used except to populate the address element in the WSDL. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;It'll be the work of minutes to roll this code up into a little EXE that takes the class name on the command line. I'll probably add an option to reflect over all classes in an assembly, looking for anything with a [WebMethod] attribute on it somewhere and emitting that, too. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>16</thr:total></entry><entry><id>2878</id><published>2004-10-18T14:30:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-10-18T14:30:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Generating WSDL Without ASP.NET</title><content type="html">Wow, very cool.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Depending on the changes that you want to the proxy, you can customize the generation of those using the ServiceDescriptionImporter class. That's the code that you point to a WSDL file and it generates a CodeDom tree with the proxies. That tree can programmatically manipulated, then spat out into a file.

Well, I decided to take it a step farther and see if I could generate the proxies directly, too. As it turns out, that's pretty easy, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code turned out to be a bit long for a blog post, so I added it to my wiki instead. You can find the article &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig.RebuildingWsdlExe"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to generating the proxy class without generating WSDL, I went ahead and added the code to walk over the generated code and strip out any type that isn't the proxy itself. Because we have several web services that share a set of types, and since we have defined these common types in a separate shared assembly to avoid type identity problems, this means the generated code looks just how we like it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't made the code bulletproof or terribly generic, since it's just for our use here at my client, but it should serve as a reasonable starting point for anyone that wants to produce custom proxies. One variation I can think of that would be useful would be to generate every type into its own file - that way if you had some types that you wanted to share and some that you didn't, it would be easy to automate which get tossed and which get kept. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>2929</id><published>2004-10-21T02:07:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-10-21T02:07:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Rewriting WSDL.EXE</title><content type="html">There's probably a fair amount of demand for this kind of functionality that strips out the types which are generated along with the proxy class. This seems to be the #1 question in the web services newsgroups: "how do I share my type XYZ between a web service and its consumer?"
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Getting caught by the SOA police is not the only issue you can run into if you break one of the SOA tenets (share schema, not types) this way.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;One issue is that you will need to deliver the assembly containing the type(s) to the consumers and pay special attention to versioning. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Another potential gotcha is that by default XML serialization does not serialize private members. This might create some surprises down the road unless you know what you are doing.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2919"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>2930</id><published>2004-10-21T04:27:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-10-21T04:27:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Rewriting WSDL.EXE</title><content type="html">I don't consider this sharing types. I consider it a more convenient way to generate proxies for the times where I'm writing both sides. Others can still generate proxies however they like. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As for versioning, that's already a problem no matter how you generate your proxies - I can't see that this makes a bad problem any worse. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Agreed that private state not being serialized is an issue if you're not aware of it. But if someone generated a proxy (say) by hand, they still have the same issue. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2919"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>13865</id><published>2005-08-04T11:48:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-08-04T11:48:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Rewriting WSDL.EXE</title><content type="html">I recently ran into this problem myself and in fact I am here at your site because the MS rep sent me here as an alternative to manually modifying the reference.cs file generated by 
&lt;br /&gt;Visual Studio.  I wanted to be able to put an attribute on the WebMethod to tell the generation tool not to generate types for the method and/or the each parameter.  He is recommending the VS team look at the issue.  Based on some simple searches on the web, it seems I am not the only one who feels this way.  It just makes sense when you are writing both sides or sharing complex objects in a rather large web service implementation.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;BTW, if you have an enum as a formal parameter, the generated proxy class for the enum does not necessarily come out in the same order as your original enum specification.  Therefore MyColorEnum.Blue != VSProxy.MyColorEnum.Blue.  If you create a converter to work between them, you have to use an if or a switch otherwise there is no guarantees.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2919"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>13866</id><published>2005-08-04T11:59:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-08-04T11:59:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Rewriting WSDL.EXE</title><content type="html">This is a fairly powerful approach that has evolved slightly since I originally wrote the article.

&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I didn't think I was going to like &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590594010/qid=1098641271/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-4209329-0929617?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beginning .NET Game Programming in VB.NET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It's written in VB.NET (I'm a C# guy), it's a beginner's book, and most DirectX/gaming books suck. Fortunately, I was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that whenever I'm learning a technology, I generally want two books. I want to start with a good tutorial, and once I understand the basics, I want a good theory and reference book to help me explore in my own directions. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590594010/qid=1098641271/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-4209329-0929617?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beginning .NET Game Programming in VB.NET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; makes absolutely no secret of the fact that it is very much the former, and not at all the latter. Frankly, had it tried to be a reference book, it probably would have failed, if for no other reason than that &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tmiller/"&gt;Tom Miller&lt;/a&gt; already wrote &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0672325969/qid=1098641771/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-4209329-0929617?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books"&gt;the best Managed DirectX reference/theory book&lt;/a&gt;.But &lt;a href="http://www.inkblog.com"&gt;David&lt;/a&gt;, Alexandre, and Ellen set out to write a tutorial work, and I think they did a pretty reasonable job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book starts off by writing a Tetris clone using only GDI+ (no DirectX), but builds up to a network multiplayer 3D game. Since the book is fairly short by computer text standards, it moves at a pretty good clip, presenting the material by writing and analyzing several different interesting games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd have to say that this approach is the book's greatest strength: the fact that it is very much grounded in &lt;em&gt;writing a game&lt;/em&gt;. That means it doesn't hand-wave over things like DirectPlay or DirectInput (although graphics does get the majority of the coverage). There's even some discussion of DirectDraw, which is fairly rare these days. And along with all the technology stuff, they constantly talk about the other factors for successful game development (e.g. “Source control is not optional” and “Write lots of small games first”). This is a goodness, as is the plethora of working game code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book isn't perfect, of course. I came across several errors, none too serious, that seemed to be largely related to the fact that much of the code in the book was ported from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590593197/qid=1098642258/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/002-4209329-0929617?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books"&gt;the C# companion work&lt;/a&gt;, which I haven't read. I also was a bit disappointed with the coverage of the issues around network play - I would have liked to have seen more discussion on this area. Still, it was arguably a good decision for them to cover less, not more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone that had some VB.NET experience, and was interested in getting started with game programming. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>12</thr:total></entry><entry><id>2981</id><published>2004-10-24T20:49:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-10-24T20:49:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Book Review: Beginning .NET Game Programming in VB.NET</title><content type="html">THanks for the good words, Craig!

&lt;br /&gt;FYI, the VB code hasn't yet been posted on the Apress site because the new October SDK broke various pieces of the games (as well as the C# version).  I'm working on getting the new code posted ASAP.

The problem is that many of the stubs in Chapters 1 and 2 don't properly work (or weren't intended to work as-is).  This is partly due to the fact that the first chapters weren't written by me, but the broader issue is that the code in the book wasn't meant to be complete, compilable code.  Rather, each snippet was meant to highlight parts of code from the downloadable source that you should pay attention to.  I do agree, however, that parts of the code in chapter 1 and 2 have no counterpart in the downloadable source code.  I do apologize for that inconvenience.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2975"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>14367</id><published>2005-08-26T13:49:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-08-26T13:49:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Book Review: Beginning .NET Game Programming in VB.NET</title><content type="html">Stay away from this book!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Even Craig says "I'd have to say that this approach is the book's greatest strength: the fact that it is very much grounded in writing a game."
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Not really, if you try to write a game from this book it will not work.  The final project is built up from little projects and the little projects do not work.  I'll admit you can get the source code for the final project and try to understand the concepts of the chapter, but that defeats the purpose of building you knowledge through the smaller easier to understand projects.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;My last post addressed this issue and the first author of the book says "I do apologize for that inconvenience", sorry thats not how you handle a serious flaw in you'r book.  You do whatever it takes to fix it.  In this case I would recommend, posting working examples of smaller projects for each chapter.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Most of the reviews on Amazon are negative as well.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I can not recommend this book at this time.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2975"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>14392</id><published>2005-08-27T15:06:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-08-27T15:06:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Book Review: Beginning .NET Game Programming in VB.NET</title><content type="html">Well, if what you're looking for is code you can download and run without having to do anything to it, then I guess you should look elsewhere. But for my part I'll stand by my recommendation - the book addresses practical aspects of game programming, rather than simply presenting an API. For example, I love that the advice, "You must use source control" appears in the book. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I've never much cared if the code compiles. If I can read it, and it makes the concept clear, then it has served its purpose as far as I'm concerned.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2975"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>14565</id><published>2005-09-07T16:37:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-09-07T16:37:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Book Review: Beginning .NET Game Programming in VB.NET</title><content type="html">I dont know what that guy is talking about.

&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href="http://rover.cs.northwestern.edu/~surana/blog/past/000196.html"&gt;another of my friends&lt;/a&gt;, I'll take a crack at predicting the election. Only I think it's going to be Bush. My reasoning for this is somewhat indirect. I'm basing it on the fact that I'm usually too optimistic. I'd really like Kerry to win, and I find myself thinking he could do it. But see, since I think he “could”, that means he's probably trailing in reality. Most polls seem to support that supposition, although margin of error and the electoral system mean that it's all up in the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd love, love, love to be wrong. I think Kerry will be an indifferent president, will make about the same decisions Bush would in Iraq (we're there to stay, basically), and won't be able to influence the economy that much (presidents get too much blame and too much credit there). Basically, I'm guessing we're looking at another Carter in Kerry. But I want the civil-liberty-supressing, short-sighted adventures we've got running the show right now out. And if nothing else, I want a Democrat to do the nominating of the next set of Supreme Court nominees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, hope I'm wrong. To that end, at nearly 33 years of age I voted in this election. That make it my first vote ever (absentee because of the baby). &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>11</thr:total></entry><entry><id>3132</id><published>2004-11-01T16:51:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-11-01T16:51:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Election Prediction</title><content type="html">First vote- I'm surprised.

Since my personal opinion is that that Bush will be remembered as a disasterous president, the choice seemed clean. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Your argument from an economic basis resonates with me - but I happen to think that a President who is pursuing a costly war, who is unwilling to compromise on much, who spends wildly on other things, and who has Congress behind him will not be good for the economy. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Kerry, as a Democrat, would also tend to spend too much, but at least he'd be willing to raise taxes to pay for it, rather than borrowing heavily, endangering the economy. Plus, he'd be in opposition with a Republican legislature, which tends to produce more moderate economic policy. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So, no, I wasn't advocating a return to the 70s. :) I'm no economist, but those are my views, based on the world as I understand it.

In addition to fixing a bunch of bugs (some of them pretty significant), I've also added support for a new editing format: Link2. Link2 is a lot like Link, except you can set the underlining and the text color to whatever you like. The built-in Link format mandates blue text with a solid underline. That's a non-starter for an application like &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FlexWikiPad"&gt;FlexWikiPad&lt;/a&gt; that needs to indicate whether the destination of the link already exists or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This turned out to be a major undertaking. Because of the inherent “it almost doesn't suck” nature of the underlying rich edit control, I found myself in a lengthy spiral of getting it almost working, only to discover that I need to change “just one more thing”. To give you some idea of how far down the spiral went, let me share that I had to completely rewrite the double-click handling of the control by intercepting and processing all WM_LBUTTONCLICK events. Quite a rabbit hole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I got it working, and I'm pretty pleased with it. My next steps for the control will be to add support for things like bullets, borders, and shading. The latter two are particularly important for what I want to do with FlexWikiPad. Once I get that done, I'll do a pass through to focus on whatever bugs I know about, then stamp it 1.0. After that, I'll integrate it into FlexWikiPad as part of my complete overhaul of the formatting engine. And if I do that right, I should be able to turn the knob way up on how powerful and customizable FlexWikiPad is. Wish me luck! &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>3537</id><published>2004-11-17T06:10:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-11-17T06:10:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Wangdera Controls Version 0.8</title><content type="html">I like your Controls but I am not sure if I will use it, because of a missing feature.

&lt;br /&gt;The API for the RichEdit control supports this, but doesn't actually draw it. So I need to override WM_PAINT handling and do it myself. Tricky, but I'll try. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="3403"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>3586</id><published>2004-11-20T07:55:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-11-20T07:55:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Setback in Text Editor Land</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We took the baby with us up to Wharton this weekend so my wife could resume her MBA classes. That left me to look after the munchkin, and when she was asleep, alone in the hotel room with nothing pressing begging for my attention. Sweet! Uninterrupted hacking time! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back to working on &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/10/12/2760.aspx"&gt;RichTextEditor&lt;/a&gt;, which has been my obsession these last few months. My goal for the upcoming release is to add paragraph formatting, including the ability to add shading and borders. Since there are fields called things like &lt;em&gt;wShading&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;wBorders&lt;/em&gt; in the underlying Rich Edit control that RichTextBox is a wrapper for, I thought I'd be able to do it without too much work. Foolish Craig. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that, although the structures listed in the Platform SDK support the full range of things that can be described in a Rich Text document, the Rich Edit control does not. It stores the values so that you can roundtrip the text with (say) Word, but it doesn't change the way that anything gets displayed. So you can, for example, tell the control to draw borders around a paragraph all you want, but it won't do a damn thing about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that's not the real showstopper. I actually thought that might be the case, and came up with a few strategies for working around it. Specifically, what I tried to do was to let the Rich Edit control draw the text, and then draw borders and shading over the top of it with my own GDI+ calls. I even got a prototype working, drawing a shaded rectangle with a border in a fixed location over some text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the prototype displayed a problem that would eventually lead me to abandon my efforts: the stuff I was drawing flickered like mad. I spent an evening working through the problem with the ever-generous &lt;a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/"&gt;Ian Griffiths&lt;/a&gt;, but in the end we came to the conclusion that the only ways to do what I want involve horrendous hacks on top of nasty grungy bits on top of the hacks I'm already doing. Things like positioning a layered window over top of the RichTextBox window and drawing on that. Blech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it comes down to is that the Rich Edit control (and by extension RichTextBox and derivatives) is an 80% solution. Most of the time, you can get it to do what you want. But if you're an exacting bastard like me, and you just can't do without this feature or that, you're in the other 20% and you're screwed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what am I going to do? First, I'll finish up RichTextEditor so that anyone who only needs stuff in the 80% can benefit from it. After all, it gets lots of good features from the underlying Rich Edit control, like sophisticated line breaking and support for East Asian languages. But once I get that out of the way, I'm going to write my own text editor control, from scratch, in managed code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's exactly the sort of “reinvent the wheel” scenario that I was hoping to avoid, but I don't think there's any way around it. And I'm looking forward to the experience, too, especially if I can pull it off the way I envision it. My only disappointment is that further development of &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FlexWikiPad"&gt;FlexWikiPad&lt;/a&gt; is going to be delayed by however long it takes me to write a stable text editor control.

So this weekend I was able to put the finishing touches on the 0.9 release of the &lt;a href="http://sf.net/projects/wangdera"&gt;Wangdera Control Suite&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, I've fixed a bunch of bugs with &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/10/12/2760.aspx"&gt;RichTextBox2 and RichTextEditor&lt;/a&gt;, and added paragraph formatting capabilities in. So now you can do things like bulleted and numbered lists, set line spacing, and set the justification. Basically, I believe I've now exposed everything that's present in the underlying rich edit control. Combine that with the other performance and feature enhancements, and I think I've made something that's a real improvement over the (decidedly lame) &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemwindowsformsrichtextboxclasstopic.asp"&gt;RichTextBox&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I labeled the version number 0.9, I really see this as more of a 1.0RC1 release. That is, I think it's ready for prime time, but I'm willing to believe there are still a few bugs. (Actually, I know there are a few minor bugs, but the ones I know about are because of weird behavior in the underlying control, so there's not much I can do about them.) Of course, I've already determined that &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/11/20/3586.aspx"&gt;the rich edit route is the wrong one for me&lt;/a&gt;, but like I said before, I still think it'll be useful for someone. So I got it done and posted so I can move on to the next thing. Enjoy! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it seems like all I do on this blog lately is announce the release of software, well, that's because I've been working pretty hard on releasing software. :)&lt;/p&gt;

The problem I ran into is that the syntax for a regex replacement is ${&lt;em&gt;group&lt;/em&gt;}, which is exactly the same as the syntax for a property in a NAnt script. I figured there must be an escape sequence in NAnt that lets you say, “No, I really want a dollar sign and a curly brace - I'm not specifying a property.“ But I tried backslash and the other usual suspects, then searched the web for a while. Nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#800000"&gt;property&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#ff00ff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#ff0000"&gt;name&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;="replacement" &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#ff0000"&gt;value&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;="http://localhost/${product.name}-${websafe.version}&lt;strong&gt;${'${path}'}&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#ff00ff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the &lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;${'${path}'}&lt;/font&gt; that actually does the trick: basically, I'm saying, “Use the string literal ${path}.“ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty sure this will only work in NAnt 0.85 and later, as that's when string literal expressions were introduced. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>9</thr:total></entry><entry><id>15664</id><published>2005-10-18T09:56:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-10-18T09:56:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Escaping ${} in NAnt Scripts</title><content type="html">Thank you for posting this.

Basically, if you called the BatchFormat method to format a range of text, any text you subsequently typed into that range would be rendered as black on a black background. &lt;a href="http://www.moviequotes.com/fullquote.cgi?qnum=51623"&gt;It's like, how much more black could this be? And the answer is none. None more black.&lt;/a&gt; Whoops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will protest that it's not &lt;b&gt;entirely &lt;/b&gt;my fault. The problem is that the underlying Windows Rich Edit control (hate it!) will lie to you about what the format of the text is. So when I was saving the format of the text and then “restoring“ it later, it was causing a problem. But since I knew about the problem when I shipped 0.9, I probably should have caught the bug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's fixed now, and you can &lt;a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=117783&amp;amp;package_id=132545&amp;amp;release_id=288486"&gt;download it&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I'll just state here that right now it's primarily a replacement for RichTextBox, to give you a text editor that lets you set styles like font and color. It also has support for autocomplete (i.e. Intellisense). I've used it to write a SQL editor that does things like turn "select" blue as you type. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="3773"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>3775</id><published>2004-12-08T10:01:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-12-08T10:01:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Tabs Are Evil</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For about the 10,000th time today, I opened a file that looks something like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;  &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;static&lt;/font&gt; Crypto()&lt;br /&gt;        {&lt;br /&gt;            &lt;font color="#008000"&gt;// Set up the Rsa provider to use the machine key store. If you don't, &lt;br /&gt;            // creating the provider will fail when you run under ASP.NET. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;  CspParameters cp = &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;new&lt;/font&gt; CspParameters();&lt;br /&gt;            cp.Flags = CspProviderFlags.UseMachineKeyStore;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;      &lt;font color="#008000"&gt;// TODO: verify that we can encrypt 5 bytes, just so we don't get a &lt;br /&gt;           // false positive that makes us think we failed because of block size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;I highly doubt that the developer who wrote it would have put up with this randomly indented presentation, so why do I have to? The problem is that developers love to hit the tab key to line things up, which generally inserts a tab character. Of course, different people and different editors choose different widths to use to display a tab character. Worse, it's easy to mix using tabs and spaces to align your code. After all, it'll look lined up to &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt;, but when &lt;strong&gt;I &lt;/strong&gt;open it, I get the mess above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, run, don't walk, to your favorite development tool and set the equivalent of this VS.NET option: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pluralsight.com/craig/images/notabs.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will cause VS.NET to insert n spaces (instead of a tab character) whenever you hit the tab key, where n is whatever value you put in the “Tab size” textbox. I don't particularly care what number you use (although 2 is clearly the choice of the most discerning developers) - the point is that as long as you don't use tabs to line up your code, it'll line up for both of us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a public service message brought to you by the Terminally Picky Developers Association for Readable Code. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>34</thr:total></entry><entry><id>3777</id><published>2004-12-08T10:33:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-12-08T10:33:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Tabs Are Evil</title><content type="html">Ctrl-K F will fix whatever code you have highlighted.

&lt;br /&gt;Inserting spaces for tabs, on the other hand, is available in many tools. And, if you use two spaces, the only downside is having to hit backspace one extra time when deleting over one, as you can still use tab to insert a pair of spaces.

The same argument would say you should cut down on comments and try to keep all your source on the same line. 
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;1. I agree with those that say the problem is in the mix and not in the tabs
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;2. I don't understand why it takes a lot of concentration to stop pressing the space bar. Just stop doing it!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;3. The reason I like tabs is this: I can change the tab placement on the fly. So if I have some deeply indented code, I may switch to 2 (or even 1) space per tab. But for my code (small methods, little nesting), I'll keep it at 4, because to my eye it is more readable.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;4. I've used regex to go both ways. Works like a charm.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;5. Even better than VS's format is Resharper's format.

My point is that leading tabs work fine in all editors and you can easily adjust the tab width in many of them, and as long as you're using fixed width fonts any spaces later in the line of code will align perfectly regardless of the tab settings.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I know people who prefer to code using proportional fonts (I hate this, personally, but I do know people who do it), and that makes alignment by anything other than tabs just plain painful.

The problem is that there's no way to enforce developers always entering tabs. They can (and therefore will) continue to hit the spacebar instead of using the tab key. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If the tools supported automatically turning two (or three or four) consecutive spaces into tabs *as I typed*, then I'd happily use tabs. But they don't, so I'll always get a mix...unless I turn on "insert spaces for tabs". That's just the only option for automatically always getting consistent indenting right now. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Believe me, I wish it worked the way you suggest. I have a client that has mandated four space tabs, and I hate it (I like two).

The issue is interoperability: the default WSDL representation of a DataSet is an arbitrary schema followed by arbitrary XML. That's just a bit on the loose side for most toolkits to deal with in the general case. However, one use case that drives the desire to use a DataSet in the first place is that the type of data to be returned is not known precisely until runtime. Lately, I discovered yet another corner of XmlSerializer that helps me deal with some of these situations without having to resort to using a DataSet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that sometimes, although you don't know the &lt;strong&gt;exact &lt;/strong&gt;type of data you'll be returning, you do know that it's going to be one of a known set of types. This is particularly common when you're returning the results of a database query: you might know that all your columns are either strings, booleans, integers, dates, or floating point numbers. If that's the case, there's an XML schema construct that allows you to say, “I want to have one of the following elements appear here.” It's called &lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&amp;lt;xs:choice&amp;gt;&lt;/font&gt;, and here's a schema fragment that demonstrates its use: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&amp;lt;xs:element name=“item“&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;xs:complexType&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;xs:choice&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;      &amp;lt;xs:element minOccurs=“1“ maxOccurs=“1“ name=“string“ type=“xs:string“ /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;      &amp;lt;xs:element minOccurs=“1“ maxOccurs=“1“ name=“integer“ type=“xs:int“ /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;      &amp;lt;xs:element minOccurs=“1“ maxOccurs=“1“ name=“boolean“ type=“xs:boolean“ /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;      &amp;lt;xs:element minOccurs=“1“ maxOccurs=“1“ name=“date“ type=“xs:dateTime“ /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;      &amp;lt;xs:element minOccurs=“1“ maxOccurs=“1“ name=“float“ type=“xs:float“ /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;    &amp;lt;/xs:choice&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;/xs:complexType&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/xs:element&amp;gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this schema means is that when an “item” element appears, it must have as a child exactly one of the elements &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;integer&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;boolean&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;date&amp;gt;, or &amp;lt;float&amp;gt;. Further, if the child element is &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;, the contents of that element must be a string. But if the child element is &amp;lt;integer&amp;gt;, then the contents must be an integer, and so on and so forth. It's a reasonably “normal“ bit of schema, and while I have no idea what the support in various non-.NET toolkits looks like, support for it is a lot more likely to exist than for the vagaries of DataSet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an XML standpoint, this is a pretty nice thing. It lets us express exactly what we want, namely, that we'll tell you at runtime what our choice for the type of the data is. Where this gets really great is that it's supported by System.Xml.Serialization, which powers the ASP.NET Web Services stack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how it maps: you define a class with the usual attributes from the System.Xml.Serialization namespace. But when you get to the element that you want to represent as an &amp;lt;xs:choice&amp;gt;, you simply use more than one [XmlElement] attribute, and you use the overload that lets you specify a type. Here's what I mean: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;[XmlRoot(”item”)]&lt;br /&gt;public class Item&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;  private object value; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  [XmlElement(“string“, typeof(string))]&lt;br /&gt;  [XmlElement(“integer“, typeof(int))]&lt;br /&gt;  [XmlElement(“boolean“, typeof(bool))]&lt;br /&gt;  [XmlElement(“date“, typeof(DateTime))]&lt;br /&gt;  [XmlElement(“float“, typeof(float))]&lt;br /&gt;  public object Value&lt;br /&gt;  { &lt;br /&gt;    get { return value; }&lt;br /&gt;    set { this.value = value; }&lt;br /&gt;  } &lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the serializer encounters this type during either serialization or deserialization, it will use the attributes to control the mapping between element names and .NET types. Which is to say, when the Value is a float, you'll get &amp;lt;float&amp;gt;, when the Value is string, you'll get a &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;, and (better still) vice versa! You have to do a type test and typecast at the other end, like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;if (foo.Value is string) { DealWithString((string) foo.Value); }&lt;br /&gt;else if (foo.value is float) { DealWithFloat((float) foo.Value); }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;// etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But big deal. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By itself, this is a fairly powerful feature. And there's still more we can do, but I think I'll stop this entry now while this entry is still reasonably short. More later. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>9</thr:total></entry><entry><id>3933</id><published>2004-12-14T14:21:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-12-14T14:21:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: I'm Pro-xs:choice</title><content type="html">Very interesting.

&lt;br /&gt;As far as the arbitrary XML created by a DataSet, wouldn't a typed-DataSet be a decent alternative?

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;1) Equivalent to the serialization format for an array of strongly-typed objects. 
&lt;br /&gt;2) Equivalent to the serialization format of DataSet. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If it's #1, great, but that doesn't let you vary type at runtime. If it's #2, then it's no different on the wire than using a DataSet. From a marshalling standpoint, you may as well just use an object array or a DataSet. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Not saying they aren't useful, just that they don't let you do what multiple [XmlElement] declarations does. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="3931"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>3941</id><published>2004-12-15T05:06:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-12-15T05:06:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Craig Andera on XML Serialization</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="3931"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>4782</id><published>2005-01-05T16:21:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-01-05T16:21:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: I'm Pro-xs:choice</title><content type="html">Awesome awsome awesome. I'm in the midst of creating an XSD and xs:choice is one of my concerns when I'm ready to code the corresponding classes.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So just thinking about it real quick, one isn't limited to the just Xml data types, but also custom types..
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Given an (simple) xml type defined in an XSD: &amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;xs:simpleType name="HierarchicalNumberType"&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;xs:annotation&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;xs:documentation&amp;gt;Type which represents a HierarchicalNumber&amp;lt;/xs:documentation&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/xs:annotation&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;xs:restriction base="xs:token"&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;xs:pattern value="([A-Z|a-z]+|[\d]+)(\.([A-Z|a-z]+|[\d]+))*"/&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/xs:restriction&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/xs:simpleType&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/snip&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;a corresponding C# type:
&lt;br /&gt;[XmlElement(”HierarchicalNumberType”)]
&lt;br /&gt;public class HierarchicalNumber {...}
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;you could also include that in your choice
&lt;br /&gt;[XmlElement(“HierarchicalNumber“, typeof(HierarchicalNumber))]
&lt;br /&gt;[XmlElement(“Integer“, typeof(int))]
&lt;br /&gt;public object Value() 
&lt;br /&gt;{
&lt;br /&gt;  get {...}
&lt;br /&gt;  set {...}
&lt;br /&gt;}
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;the same with complex types that may itself include an xs:choice -- ad infintium..

It was a huge year for me, both personally and professionally; I hope yours was as good as mine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of the year (or in this case, the beginning of the next) is traditionally a time to look back at what happened through the lens of hindsight. Who am I to resist jumping on the bandwagon? Herewith, a tour of the highlights of my year as seen via CraigBlog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, I &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/01/23/1183.aspx"&gt;started up at MSDN again&lt;/a&gt;. Focusing on writing production software was a huge theme for me in 2004: while I've done it before a little, my career has long been focused more on research and troubleshooting than on the ruthlessly practical world of getting software out the door. It was enormously educational, and really fun. And I'm still not done learning how to do it better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, I wrote &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/02/12/1199.aspx"&gt;the last Direct3D tutorial&lt;/a&gt; of the year. At the time, I didn't think it was going to be the last one, but things just kept getting busier and busier, and I haven't yet found the time to get back to the series. I do still plan to write more, but I don't know when I'm going to get there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, I &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/03/24/1271.aspx"&gt;bid GotDotNet adieu permanently&lt;/a&gt;. As a workspace environment, I find it lacking in several regards. My discontent in part led to the migration of &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://sf.net"&gt;SourceForge&lt;/a&gt;, a journey which took a large part of the rest of 2004 to complete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, I &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/04/23/1368.aspx"&gt;got the FwContrib project set up on SourceForge&lt;/a&gt;. FwContrib contains the project to which I have devoted over a year of my spare time now: &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki/FlexWikiPad.html"&gt;FlexWikiPad&lt;/a&gt;. Oh, and April was also the month where I &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/04/18/1339.aspx"&gt;found a three-foot snake in the basement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, I &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/05/31/1434.aspx"&gt;shipped version 1.0 of FwSync&lt;/a&gt;. Finishing something and getting it “out there” was quite a milestone for me. Hopefully 2005 will see the same goal met for FlexWikiPad. May was also the month where my wife was accepted into the Executive MBA program at Wharton, something which negatively impacts my free time now, and (hopefully) positively impacts my income later. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, I &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/06/29/1502.aspx"&gt;found a nasty bug in System.Decimal&lt;/a&gt; while working on &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/default.aspx"&gt;MSDN2&lt;/a&gt;. I submitted it via the &lt;a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/productfeedback/viewfeedback.aspx?feedbackid=5203e06f-8249-4a1d-8688-c617dbbfa65a"&gt;Product Feedback Center&lt;/a&gt;, and it got fixed for Whidbey. Cool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, &lt;a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/"&gt;Peter Provost&lt;/a&gt; and I &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/07/04/1541.aspx"&gt;released the dasblog2dottext importer tool&lt;/a&gt; (he wrote it, I did the build script). I also &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/07/20/1649.aspx"&gt;launched the Pluralsight Wiki&lt;/a&gt;, a fairly obvious thing for a wikihead like me to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, I released &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/08/19/1962.aspx"&gt;another version of FlexWikiPad&lt;/a&gt;, and then almost immediately &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/08/22/1998.aspx"&gt;had to patch it&lt;/a&gt;...I was definitely starting to feel like I was doing “real“ software. :) I also discovered &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/08/04/1816.aspx"&gt;Beatallica&lt;/a&gt;, a band that still amuses me months later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September was a momentous month for me. Not only did &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/09/15/2274.aspx"&gt;the alpha version of MSDN2 ship&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/09/28/2448.aspx"&gt;FlexWiki went open source&lt;/a&gt; (only the third Microsoft project to do so). I also saw &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/09/12/2229.aspx"&gt;FoamHenge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/09/29/2473.aspx"&gt;finally ditched EIF for log4net&lt;/a&gt; - a move I still don't regret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the other great stuff that happened to me this year, October is clearly the absolute highlight. And no, I'm not talking about the fact that I &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/10/12/2760.aspx"&gt;released RichTextEditor&lt;/a&gt;. The big event was that on October 28th, &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/10/28/3055.aspx"&gt;my daughter Ellen was born&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November was (understandably, I think), a slow blogging month. But I did manage to &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/10/28/3055.aspx"&gt;ship an update to RichTextEditor&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, right after that I realized that I was &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/11/20/3586.aspx"&gt;going to have to start over with my own text editor control&lt;/a&gt;. Sigh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a good chunk of December off, only managing to ship &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/12/05/3751.aspx"&gt;one update&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/12/08/3773.aspx"&gt;one patch&lt;/a&gt; to RichTextEditor. What can I say? It was a slow month. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was planning to talk about what I want to get done in 2005 too, but I think I'll wait and make that my next post. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>17762</id><published>2005-12-31T04:56:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-12-31T04:56:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Looking Forward to 2006, Looking Back on 2005</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="4668"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>4725</id><published>2005-01-03T12:28:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-01-03T12:28:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">2005</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With a new baby, my wife in school full-time, and some major rennovations going on in the basement, it's going to be hard to find free time to hack unless my current client gives me the boot and I can't find anything else. (Knock wood that doesn't happen.) Nevertheless, I have in mind what I want to do software-wise in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, foremost, and solely, I would like to get &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki/FlexWikiPad"&gt;FlexWikiPad&lt;/a&gt; to at least 1.0 status. I've been working on it for over a year in my spare time, but my vision for where I want to get it has changed little. Right now that means working on a decent text editor control that I can use for it. That'll probably take me a few months just to finish that, but I'm guessing when I'm done it'll be even more widely used than FlexWikiPad itself. Stay tuned. After that, I can finish up the last few major features I want to get into the thing, and then go on a bug-smashing tear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's actually it. I have enough other non-coding projects in my personal life that I think I need to hang up the spare-time software gig for a bit when I get FlexWikiPad to a satisfactory doneness state.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>17763</id><published>2005-12-31T04:56:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-12-31T04:56:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Looking Forward to 2006, Looking Back on 2005</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="4725"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>4766</id><published>2005-01-05T04:08:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-01-05T04:08:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Tom Miller's New Book</title><content type="html">&lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tmiller/"&gt;Tom Miller&lt;/a&gt;'s new book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672326612/102-4937017-5916901"&gt;Beginning 3D Game Programming&lt;/a&gt; is out.

And by “cool” here, I mean “almost painfully nerdy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, I've hooked up a series of colored lights to our &lt;a href="http://ccnet.thoughtworks.com/"&gt;CruiseControl.NET&lt;/a&gt; build. Via X10 automation, I turn on red, green, and/or yellow lights based on the status of the build. It looks like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/craig/images/buildlights.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I put them up on top of my cube, the lights are visible across most of the part of the floor where my team sits. I already find myself looking up to check the status whenever I arrive in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason that two lights are on in this picture has to do with the semantics I attached to the signals. The red and green lights indicate whether the last build was successful or not. The yellow light indicates that a build is in progress. I could have shut off the red or green light while a build was running, but I thought this way added a little more information while still being very easy to understand at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was actually pretty impressive how easy this setup was to get going. After ordering an automation kit ($99 from &lt;a href="http://www.x10.com/"&gt;http://www.x10.com&lt;/a&gt;), downloading the free SDK, and stopping off at Target for some cheap lamps and some bulbs (about $25), some simple perusal of the samples showed that it's basically one line of very easy-to-understand code to turn each light on or off. Monitoring the build was only slightly harder: I just used cctraylib.dll from the CruiseControl distribution to poll the build state. That was maybe 20 more lines of code. Rolling it all up into a service (so it will continue to work when I'm not logged on) took me about 90 minutes total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kit came with a bunch of other stuff that I'm not using, like remote controls and a motion sensor, so I probably could have gotten off a little cheaper. But when I finish my gig here, I'll take the whole thing home and find a use for it around the house. Hopefully something equally nerdy. :) &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>33</thr:total></entry><entry><id>5387</id><published>2005-01-24T07:01:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-01-24T07:01:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">RE: Build Lights</title><content type="html">Careful with that Axe, Eugene!

&lt;br /&gt;water sprinklers-  I program for a living, and I still cant get the sprinkler controller to work correctly.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Dog Feeder/waterer- I never get home at a decent hour, and my dogs look like its there last meal if Im a few hours late.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Alarm Clock - I have a dent in my alarm clock from hitting the snooze button so many times, If I have get up and go to my computer in my office
&lt;br /&gt;I might as well get dressed :)

&lt;br /&gt;1) Our lawn is about 10' by about 15', and we get enough rain that I don't need to water it basically ever. 
&lt;br /&gt;2) I don't have any pets.

I generally use a big dry erase board to keep track of builds and whether or not they were successful, but thats not something that can be seen as easily as your lights.  In fact, it can get to be a little convoluted with different people marking things on the board and stuff accidentally getting erased.  Your light system looks to be much more efficient, and it doesnt sound like it was very hard to set up at all.  The price isnt even that bad.  I wonder if you could really trick this out, thoughlike forget just a green light for a good build.  I want strobes, some blaring music, you knowlets celebrate when the build goes off like it should!  For those really annoying builds that seem to take forever to get to compile, maybe some optional confetti could be included.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="5386"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>51221</id><published>2008-06-26T21:24:51.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-06-26T21:24:51.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Build Lights</title><content type="html">Check this Agile Lamp out.

So as I was going through my email this weekend, trying to get caught up (sorry to those who've been waiting for answers - I'm getting there!), it was fun to sit down and answer a Direct3D question from a reader. He wanted to know how to save something he'd rendered out to a file. As it turns out, it's dead simple; as long as you set &lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;PresentationParameters.SwapEffect&lt;/font&gt; to either &lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;SwapEffect.Discard&lt;/font&gt; or &lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;SwapEffect.Copy&lt;/font&gt;, you can just use this line of code: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;SurfaceLoader.Save(filename, ImageFileFormat.Jpg, _device.GetBackBuffer(0, 0, BackBufferType.Mono)); &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to love Managed DirectX. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've posted the code &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig.DirectX.SaveToFileSample"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It's not a full-blown tutorial - those take at least a few full days each to write - just a little sparsely-commented code. Maybe I can start to post a few more little snippets like this on the &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig.DirectX.HomePage"&gt;DirectX wiki&lt;/a&gt; to make it more useful. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>6896</id><published>2005-03-27T09:55:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-03-27T09:55:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: How to Save a DirectX Image to a File</title><content type="html">Using PNG format instead of Jpg yields much better quality results with about the same size.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="5593"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>46457</id><published>2007-03-13T16:37:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-03-13T16:37:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: How to Save a DirectX Image to a File</title><content type="html">Fantastic! saved me hours!</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="5593"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>5688</id><published>2005-02-09T09:25:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-02-09T09:25:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">XSLTO</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about working on &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/default.aspx"&gt;MSDN2&lt;/a&gt; was getting to work with my longtime friends Kim and &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/tewald"&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt;. Well, &lt;a href="http://sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=1683"&gt;I see via Chris&lt;/a&gt; they've teamed up to release XSLTO (XSL Transform Objects, if I have the abbreviation correct). It's a deceptively simple little bit of code. Although I've talked with Tim about the idea several times over the last few months, this is my first chance to see the code. I think it's an extremely excellent idea, and I'll tell you why: because &lt;a href="http://nant.sf.net/"&gt;NAnt&lt;/a&gt; sucks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What? What does a build tool have to do with an object-based XML transformation utility? Well, over the last few years, I've been doing a lot of build script work. And I've come to really like the stuff that NAnt has built in, like named filesets, the solution task, integration with CruiseControl.NET, etc. It has tons of useful utilities for doing most of the things you'd want to do as part of a build, and extension points for doing stuff the NAnt team didn't think of. I like it a lot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I like it so much, why do I say it sucks? I guess I should have been more precise and said that while NAnt the &lt;strong&gt;tool&lt;/strong&gt; is great, NAnt the &lt;strong&gt;language&lt;/strong&gt; sucks. I'm constantly looking in the documentation to remember what the form of various tasks is, and it's a fair bitch to read. More, it's yet another language that my clients have to support when my contract ends and I'm out the door. Frankly, I'd much rather that NAnt-the-language looked like C#, even though it would limit some of the funky things you can do with NAnt. That's not a big deal to me because I rarely do those funky things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another language that has this same problem is XSLT. It's really great at the things it's great at (specifically, recursive descent processing of XML), but it also is Yet Another Language for me to remember and support, and I don't get all the nifty tool support I get in C#. I think XSLT is probably one of the reasons people are excited about things like &lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/Comega/"&gt;Comega&lt;/a&gt; - because they get the natural mapping to XML data types but in a way that's comfortable for C# developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to XSLTO. What Tim and Kim have done is to give you the same recursive descent processing that XSLT does so nicely, but all in C#. The core of the idea is captured in the MyTransform class from their sample. I'll reproduce it here in its entirety: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;class&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt; MyTransform : Transform &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;  [Match("/person")]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;  public&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;void&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt; Person(XPathNavigator nav) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;    Console.WriteLine(nav.Name);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;    ApplyTemplates("*");&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;  [Match("name")]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;  public&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;void&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt; Name(XPathNavigator nav) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;Console.WriteLine(nav.Name);&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;ApplyTemplates("text()");&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;  [Match("age")]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;  public&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;void&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt; Age(XPathNavigator nav) {&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;Console.WriteLine(nav.Name);&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;ApplyTemplates("text()");&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  [Match("text()")]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;  public&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;void&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt; Text(XPathNavigator nav) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;Console.WriteLine(nav.Value);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;  }&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're familiar with XSLT, the structure should look really familiar: a series of chunks of code (methods in XSLTO, templates in XSLT) that are declaratively matched to pieces of the input document (via the [Match] attribute in XSLTO, via the match attribute in XSLT). In this case, they're just printing out the value of each node, but they could just as easily have used an XmlWriter to emit a transformed version of the input document, just as you'd do in an XSLT. They've even got an ApplyTemplates() function that has the same essential meaning it does in XSLT: “Please continue finding matches and calling the appropriate bits of code.“ When all is said and done, it does exactly what you most often need to do with an XML document: crawl over all the nodes and take some arbitrary action whenever you encounter a certain node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will this technique enable all the same things you can do with XSLT? Certainly not. But I've written a fair amount of XSLT in my time, and I'd bet that 80% of it could have been done this way no problem. That figure probably goes up to 90% if they were to make the simple addition of supporting an equivalent of the apply-templates mode attribute - a change I suspect would be nearly trivial. To quote myself from earlier in this posting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frankly, I'd much rather that NAnt-the-language looked like C#, even though it would limit some of the funky things you can do with NAnt. That's not a big deal to me because I rarely do those f&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;unky things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, substitute “XSLT” for “NAnt” - the argument is the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if that weren't enough, it's impressive that it's already useful, and it's only about 300 lines of code, including comments and sample code! I'm looking forward to seeing where they go with the tool. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>5844</id><published>2005-02-13T16:41:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-02-13T16:41:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">XSLTO</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="5688"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>5959</id><published>2005-02-17T09:31:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-02-17T09:31:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: XSLTO</title><content type="html">Cool stuff!</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="5688"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>6148</id><published>2005-02-23T16:24:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-02-23T16:24:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Geek Notes 2005-02-23</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="5688"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>6317</id><published>2005-03-02T22:34:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-03-02T22:34:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: XSLTO</title><content type="html">I've ported this concept over to Java-land:

People seem to love it. What's funny is that I never use it any more. I realized a long time ago that using XmlSerializer directly to slurp a file into an object is only one or two more lines of code, and has the advantage of not making me store information in the program installation directory: &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.GuideBook/HowToDevelopCodeAsANonAdmin.html"&gt;a no-no for many reasons&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, I can put it &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemenvironmentspecialfolderclasstopic.asp"&gt;wherever it belongs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started doing Test Driven Development, doing things this way presented me with the same conundrum that many face: do I test configuration by writing data to the current user's profile directory (potentially destroying whatever application settings they had stored there), or is there some other way to do it? (This is a variation of  “Should I test against the database?”) Well, after having answered that question a few hundred times, I settled on this pattern. I know I'm not the first (or even the thousandth) person to settle into it, but I've found it useful, and hope someone else out there will too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is to make the thing that gets the configuration pluggable. Then you can have the real one that reads from the user profile directory, and a mock one that returns whatever test data you like. I usually also couple it with the idea of making the one that pulls from the real location the default, so that you can use the class in normal scenarios without having to do anything special. Something like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;public interface IGetConfigData {&lt;br /&gt;  ConfigData GetConfigData();&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;public DefaultConfigGetter : IGetConfigData {&lt;br /&gt;  public ConfigData GetConfigData() {&lt;br /&gt;    // Gets "real" config data&lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;public class MyClass {&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt; private IGetConfigData _configGetter = new DefaultConfigGetter();&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; public IGetConfigData ConfigGetter {&lt;br /&gt;    get { return _configGetter; }&lt;br /&gt;    set { _configGetter = value: }&lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;public MockConfigGetter : IGetConfigData {&lt;br /&gt;  private ConfigData _data; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;  public MockConfigGetter(ConfigData data) {&lt;br /&gt;    _data = data;&lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;  public ConfigData GetConfigData() {&lt;br /&gt;    return _data;&lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;I'd probably stay away from this for anything more complicated than this simple example, though - to me it seems less readable, and since it's only slightly less verbose, the tradeoff doesn't seem worth it for more substantial situations.

Given my work on &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt;, you might think that I would violently disagree with his take on wikis. Well, I don't. In fact, I largely agree with him: people tend to apply wikis to &lt;strong&gt;way&lt;/strong&gt; too many problems. A classic example of this is the so-called “thread mode”, where people use a wiki page to host a discussion. It sucks - mailing lists are about 10,000 times better at this particular task. The same goes for a bunch of other tasks, like formal documentation, blogs, and anything where images are important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, it's the classic &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2003/08/23/956.aspx"&gt;circle of (software) life&lt;/a&gt;. When you first see a cool technology, you think it's great at &lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt;. Later, as you internalize the concepts, you realize that there are inherent tradeoffs, and that therefore the software has limitations. Or at least, hopefully you get that far. Sadly, some never do, clinging loyally but irrationally to claims of  “it's a dessert topping &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; a floor wax!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I think that while Hacknot correctly identifies Wikiphilia as a condition that needs correcting, the overall tone of the article is disappointing. First of all, it's too dismissive, poo-pooing wikis in general, despite the fact that they are enormously useful for the things they're good at, like helping a team of people to quickly create lots of &lt;em&gt;informal &lt;/em&gt;documentation. Informal documentation is quite often worlds better than none at all, and having an easy way to create it is a massive boon to just about every software project I've ever been on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I find the Hacknot article disappointing in a more general sense, too. Previously, he's applied the concepts of scientific skepticism to deflate the hype around things like XP - which is great. Enthusiasm unbacked by evidence should be questioned. But in this case he's just made a series of unscientific observations that offer no proof of his assertions. Which to me just makes him sound like a cranky old man. Here's hoping he does better in the future. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>5993</id><published>2005-02-18T11:12:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-02-18T11:12:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Wikiphilia</title><content type="html">I totally agree - Wiki's suck for conversations, but are great for knowledge accumulation.

&lt;br /&gt;It's interesting to watch where the commercial implementations of Wiki's (like JotSpot) are going - layering structure on the Wiki model so you can do more interesting things with it. I think of traditional Wiki as just part of a community site, along with discussion groups, blogs, etc. Wiki would be a nice addition to something like CommunityServer, for example.

Recently, I got to the point where I felt like I had the mound of jobs under control, so I started working on my &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig/TextEditor.html"&gt;TextEditor&lt;/a&gt; control again. Not only is it part of my (seemingly) never-ending quest to complete &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki/FlexWikiPad"&gt;FlexWikiPad&lt;/a&gt;, but I've discovered that I really need an interesting problem to cook in the back of my head. I run and take walks to keep fit, and over the last few months I found myself a bit bored while doing so, because I wasn't hacking in my head. Weird but true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's been nice to tackle the problem again. Although the control is still completely unusable, I find myself thinking forward to features I'd like to add some day. One of them is support for images, so you can use the control to change :) into a picture of a smiley face for example. The problem is that my model for the control is of a series of styled runs of text. How do you model images in that? Should they be a special Unicode character that means “image”? If so, when someone reads the text, how will they know what to do with it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I came up with what I think is a pretty good idea: images are simply a style property of text, like being bold or being underlined. That is, I can assign “picture of smiley face” to the text “:)”, or assign “picture of my daughter” to the text “&lt;a href="http://wangdera.com/baby/XMas2004AtHome/P1100115.JPG.htm"&gt;http://wangdera.com/baby/XMas2004AtHome/P1100115.JPG.htm&lt;/a&gt;”. So when it's shown on screen, you see an image. But when you read the text, you get the original text. It's a lot like the alternate text you can apply to an image in that sense - an analogy that indicates I'm not the first guy to think of this, but that's a good thing. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>6306</id><published>2005-03-02T07:05:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-03-02T07:05:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">What a cutie</title><content type="html">Your daughter is ADORABLE.

If you're moving, she's generally happy. Since today it was about 65 degrees here in Washington, D.C., I figured I'd bring her along with me when I went out for a walk tonight. She's been out with me before in her baby carrier, and has invariably been quiet the whole time, usually falling asleep after just a few minutes. She seems to love it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was pretty dark tonight, but I take a series of smooth, paved trails through a park, and only have to walk down one road for about a block to get there. There's usually not much traffic, but tonight as I was crossing that road, I was scared out of my wits when a car flicked its lights at me as I was crossing. Scared, because it had been driving without any lights, and I hadn't noticed it until I was already in the street. It wasn't even a close call, and clearly the driver saw me, but when you're carrying your baby, that's the sort of thing that takes the starch right out of you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By itself, that would have been no big deal. Like I said, there was no real danger, I was just startled. So I continued my walk into the park. But Ellen started to complain. First it was just a bit of whimpering, then some intermittent crying. I kept going, figuring she was tired, and that the walking would be just the thing to soothe her to sleep. Not so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, the crying continued to increase in intensity until she was into the “truly upset” range. “Oh well,” I figured, “I guess I don't get to take my full walk tonight.” I turned around, and when Ellen continued to freak out, I called my wife so she could come meet us in the car so we could get Ellen home the sooner to figure out what was up with her. As I was walking back to meet up with her at the parking lot, I saw some cars go speeding up the hill not far away. “Probably the same idiot teenager that was driving around with his lights off - out having fun tonight.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, not so. No, as I walked up to my wife's car, I found out exactly what those lights were, as no less than three police cars came zooming up to box us into the end of the parking lot. It seems that the police had “had a report of  some guy wandering around in the woods with a baby.” My response? “Yes, that's exactly what I was doing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately the officers were very reasonable and polite about it. They believed my account of events immediately, and after simply noting my name and address, bid us a polite good night. Frankly, it's nice to know that the response in our neighborhood is so sure and swift. My wife took the baby and walked the three blocks home (she'd forgotten to bring the car seat), and I drove the car back. An episode of &lt;em&gt;Whose Line Is It Anyway? &lt;/em&gt;went a long way toward calming me down a bit, but the surreality of the whole event is still with me. I'm sure I'll have some interesting dreams tonight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at the end of it all, I have to wonder if the same goon that was driving without his/her lights was the person that phoned me in. If so, it says something fairly interesting about their priorities. Whomever it was, I definitely won't be taking Ellen for walks after dark any more. Not because I don't think it's safe (I do), but because I don't need that sort of hassle when there's a possibility that Ellen doesn't even like it for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;Happened in Redmond, in Marymoore park.
&lt;br /&gt;A grandfather came to visit his 5-year old from Russia. The whole family went to the Marymoore park. The parents were nearby in the park, but not right by the car. The grandfather was inside the car with the id. He sat the kid on his laps and was talkign and playing with him. A "good samaritan" driving by, noticed "an old man molesting the child in the back seat of the car", and gace an anonymous phone call to the police. Two patrol cars surrounded the car and scared the bejesus out of the old man, who, as you can imagine, doesn't speak English. The only thing that spared him from arrest was that the kid did speak English. He explained the officers that the old man is his grandfather and stuff, but the whole scene was, IMHO, very embarassing to the old man that was almost jumped on by two police officers.
&lt;br /&gt;Reminded me of the times of the wholy inquisition - if two respectable town citizens reported you as a witch, you're be burned alive.

&lt;p&gt;I've thought for a long time now that strongly named assemblies cause more trouble than they're worth (in most scenarios). This was brought home to me late last night at work as I struggled to recover from an ill-planned upgrade of &lt;a href="http://nant.sf.net/"&gt;NAnt&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, I got screwed by the fact that the version of &lt;a href="http://ndoc.sf.net/"&gt;NDoc&lt;/a&gt; that ships with NAnt is identical to the one I could download, but because they were built on different days, they had different build numbers, and that lead to some assembly load failures. OK, so that's more an argument for “don't base your build number on the date”, but that's another post. The experience still served to reinforce my low opinion of strongly-named assemblies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, the problem is that the whole strong-naming thing is supposed to give us two features: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tamper detection: If someone mucks with your assembly, the runtime will detect it because it's “signed“. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version policy: A strong name means that only exactly the version you request will satisfy a load attempt. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course, to do the first one right, you really need to have a whole PKI infrastructure in place, not to mention keeping private keys under tight control. And what do you do if it's an open source project? Even if you solve that problem, I still look at it and say, “If someone has the ability to mess with the bits in some DLL on my hard drive, I probably have bigger problems.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think point number two suffers from a severe case of over-engineering. Or, if you like, the issue is that the problem is just inherently very, very hard. Because the system has no way of inferring anything about whether two different versions are compatible or not, it has to assume that they never are. Which leads to problems like the one I had where NDoc.Core 1.3.1856.0 and NDoc.Core 1.3.1811.0 don't talk to each other. Of course, there are hooks like the &amp;lt;assemblyBinding&amp;gt; element in the config file (which I wound up using), but the rules are complex, and the file is hard to get right. Oh, and it fails silently if you get it wrong. The mere fact that the assembly loading and versioning versioning talk I used to give was three hours long should tell you something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent more and more of my time over the last few years writing real systems, I'm convinced that the simple approach to assembly loading is usually best: don't use strong names. Just put all your DLLs and EXEs in one directory, and the right thing will happen. In the rare event that you do need to make a breaking change to an assembly and you aren't recompiling the whole application, just change the name, like foo2.dll. Some may object that it's less aesthetically pleasing, but I think developers do a lot of stupid stuff in the name of making things prettier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will this approach always work? Of course not. BizTalk is one place where you're pretty well constrained to deploy to the GAC, and that means using strong names. Fine - not your choice, and there may well be a good reason for them making you do it that way. But I'd be willing to bet that 99% of the code out there isn't being deployed somewhere where strong names are a requirement. So make your life simple(r) and ditch strong names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There - I feel better now. :) &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>40</thr:total></entry><entry><id>6657</id><published>2005-03-11T04:46:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-03-11T04:46:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: I Hate Strong Names</title><content type="html">Hi Craig.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Using strong names in this scenario gives you a couple of things that are really valuable. First, you can assign very specific security permissions for only the assemblies that have your strong name (admins love this one) and thus avoid having to open a very wide security hole. Second, you get the protection of knowing that no clever hack on the client end could use (or attempt to use) your assemblies for anything they weren't designed to do. Versioning and such can be handled by publisher policy assemblies.

It is invalid to assume that because an assembly is strong named and because it is verified to be "untouched" that it truely contains the information the developer placed in it.  I can very easily spoof a strong named assembly, assuming the public key evidence isn't being matched against a known valid value.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Consider this scenario:
&lt;br /&gt;A strong named assembly exists on the web for download.  I download the assembly, rip out the MSIL, make a change (or 10), re-build the assembly signing it with a newly generated public/private key combo, hack the website and replace the existing assembly with mine.  Will the verification of the assembly succeed when it is accessed by a client?  You bet it will, because the hash of the assembly matches perfectly.  And unless a client explicitly validates which key was used in the strong naming, they are none the wiser.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;All that to say, strong naming does provide excellent versioning, and CAN be used to validate the source of an assembly, assuming that you match the key information against a known value.  But that is still no guarantee that the private key of the developer hasn't been compromised. :)</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="6653"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>6668</id><published>2005-03-11T09:50:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-03-11T09:50:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: I Hate Strong Names</title><content type="html">Wesner: but will the default policy be the same as now?

It all makes perfect sense for GAC deployed assemblies, where you can have multiple versions installed simultaneously. For private assemblies, you can't, so there isn't much point in enforcing it - all you're doing is breaking the app until they define binding redirects or install publisher policy. Plus, since publisher policy goes in the GAC, you break XCOPY deployment. Lame.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that for component providers (people providing class libraries, controls, etc), when you don't strong name your assemblies you're limiting what your customers can do. If I ship a class library that isn't strong named, then I'm preventing my customers from strong-name signing their assemblies. So now they can't put their code in the GAC, use it in COM interop scenarios, etc. It's a real drag.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Also, often times limiting what your customers can do is a good thing. Not always, but sometimes. There's a common tendency towards "Avoiding decisions by providing options"...vendors should think hard about whether or not COM interop, etc. is an important scenario.

That is, however, the exact scenario that you're encountering, so it's appropriate for the discussion.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Does ndoc.core need to be strong-name signed? Probably not, in this particular case. But for a library vendor, limiting what your customer can do can directly translate into lost revenue. All it takes is one customer insisting that they be able to install their assembly into the GAC...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I think the problem needs to be solved on the framework side. Hopefully Whidbey will address this, but I haven't checked yet.

And as you said, even there the choice was questionable. The general scenario - perhaps as much as 95% of the time - it sounds like we don't disagree on: don't use them.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If we want to segue into discussions of customer pressure, then I would like to challenge your statement about "all it takes is one customer". I think that if you're making decisions based on the demands of one customer, then you either have very few customers, or your product is going to be a mishmash of poorly thought-out features, as you'll be coding to meet the needs of every stray thought that goes through the head of your users. Just have a look at the list of feature requests on most open-source projects. Many of them don't make sense, and many are clearly giant changes to the way the product works. The same is true for closed source, in my experience. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Now, I agree that sometimes all it takes is one customer because management is making bad decisions in deciding to apply grease to the squeaky wheel. But that doesn't mean it's what *should* happen. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Which is not to say that providing features (e.g. a strongly named assembly) based on customer demand is always a bad idea - far from it. Just that, as usual, the truth lies between the extremes. Hence my original assertion that strong names should neither be always used nor never used - merely that they should be used less often than they are now. On which, it seems, we agree. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="6653"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>6684</id><published>2005-03-13T11:14:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-03-13T11:14:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: I Hate Strong Names</title><content type="html">Make sure you give Rich (http://hoser.lander.ca/) an earful about this if you get a chance...

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;My original point was simply that "unless you need to" isn't necessarily an easy thing to determine, since you are affecting more than just yourself when you make that decision about your library. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I think it's a flaw in the framework that I hope will be addressed.

&lt;br /&gt;The claim is not correct. Whidbey works the same way as v1.0. The feature you are talking about will happen in Orcas, the release after Whidbey. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Craig,
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Your observation is well noticed. Yes, if you are component vendor, you have to think about strong name and versioning.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;That is a good suggestion. I'll keep it in mind. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to say if this is a flaw or not. If the binding behavior is different in GAC than in app base, people will be more confused.

The client should determine whether they want to couple to a specific version or not, it shouldn't be dictated to them by the library.

&lt;br /&gt;Both client and library provider can dictates the version binding policy. Client through app.config and library provider through publisher policy. Actually, this is where the complexity comes in --- too many binding policies. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;We enforce the strict version binding for strongly named assemblies, because, by definition, strongly named assemlies with different version numbers are different.

&lt;br /&gt;I certainly understand why you made the decision that two different versions are considered incompatible by default. What else could you possibly do?

&lt;br /&gt;It was the thinking at that time frame. Things will undoubtfully change. But you can have a rough idea on how we will move forward. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Craig,
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;You probably will get what you want. And with more new stuff you may or may not want. It sucks. But that is how we move along. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The current policy system does have its problem. I constantly hear complain about it. We will work on it. Just not in Whidbey.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;How about if the version number was not checked for strong-named assemblies that are not in the GAC?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If the assembly is not in the GAC, but only in the local folder, surely the better assumption would be that we _do_ want to use it. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Lets consider - if the wrong version is in the local folder there are two possibilities:
&lt;br /&gt;1. It is compatible and everything works.
&lt;br /&gt;2. It is not compatible and something breaks.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But - by causing a load error if the version is different, you reduce that down to:
&lt;br /&gt;1. Whether it is compatible or not, everything breaks.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This could be controlled by a config option, so that you could turn it off if you don't like it, but it seems it would cause the code to work most of the time with no down-side?</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="6653"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>8457</id><published>2005-05-18T15:55:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-05-18T15:55:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: I Hate Strong Names</title><content type="html">The counterargument is a security-based one: if there are 30 copies of an assembly on a machine, and it turns out there's a bug, the GAC is the place where you go to update all of them and eliminate the vulnerability.

&lt;br /&gt;Of course, if you deploy privately with no strong name, you get to decide what "compatible" means. :) </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="6653"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>8470</id><published>2005-05-19T07:05:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-05-19T07:05:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: I Hate Strong Names</title><content type="html">But surely that's the point - if I deploy privately why don't I get to decide what "compatible" means in all cases, strong name or no strong name.

&lt;br /&gt;I'm not arguing against the GAC or strong names, but when the assembly is not in the GAC then surely the rules can change. Security is taken care of by the key signing, versions should have nothing to do with security. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The argument that you shouldn't have 30 copies of an assembly on a machine is another issue entirely. But given that strong named assemblies are allowed outside of the GAC - versioning needs to work differently because the versioning requirements outside of the GAC are different.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="6653"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>8471</id><published>2005-05-19T07:17:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-05-19T07:17:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: I Hate Strong Names</title><content type="html">As it stands right now, you *can* control what your application loads.

&lt;br /&gt;As for signing providing "security", I don't buy it. If they can tamper with a DLL in your app directory, they can tamper with the EXE, and you're screwed.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;1. Definitely it's about convenience - why should the _default_ behaviour break perfectly good code and require me to edit a config file every time I drop a new copy of a DLL in the folder.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;2. I agree that signing doesn't provide a great deal of security, but my point is that whatever it does provide has nothing to do with versioning.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest - versioning is there to support multiple, shared versions in the GAC, once you are deploying to the local folder there are no versioning requirements - certainly not until the OS prevents me from overwriting a file in the local folder (based on version).

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Unless you modify the source code, you don't have to publish a single character of your own source code. Even when you do modify the source code, you only have to publish that which relates.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In most cases, since it's a COMPILER, you'd be shipping an executable. If you modify it, you'd simply need to keep your changes apart from the rest of your code and ship a compiler EXE and ship the source along with that.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;"1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;"
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;"2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program... provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License."
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Don't believe the MS-FUD that the GPL is a viral license. If it were viral, everything would have to be GPL'ed since you can pipe one program through another. Piping output is perfectly acceptable and doesn't cause your code to need to be GPL'ed.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Even if you were to convert the Mono compiler into a usable OO class library, only that usable OO class library would need to be governed under the GPL. The GPL actually doesn't even mention "linking" (which doesn't even really count in C# anyway), which is what you'd do in the class library scenerio.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="6674"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>6707</id><published>2005-03-14T12:38:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-03-14T12:38:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: C# Compiler Written in C#</title><content type="html">Yes, I have read the GPL. Many times. FlexWiki uses the CPL, which is actually quite similar. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I don't actually have any problem with the GPL, although I personally prefer the MIT license. But as I've said here before, many organizations and open source projects have a "No GPL code" policy. So I can't use GPL code, even if I want to. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As far as linking, the GPL FAQ is pretty clear about what that means, and it does include DLL and DLL-like applications, which I interpret to cover C# class libraries. The LGPL exempts you from that limitation and is a different story. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Doesn't matter, though. Enough people don't want GPL code touching theirs that I basically can't use it in any of the projects I'm working on. I realize that has nothing to do with what the GPL *actually* says, but social constructs like software projects are often impacted more by perception than reality, a point on which we clearly agree (your FUD comment as evidence).
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;To clarify my linking point, the statement in the GPL:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;"These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works."

&lt;br /&gt;Allows you to ship your GPL section separately provided you do something such as create a pluggable model of use for it so you can provide an alternate implementation (which I guess in the case of functionality you might want to link to in a compiler that isn't shelled out may not quite work).</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="6674"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>6727</id><published>2005-03-15T03:34:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-03-15T03:34:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: C# Compiler Written in C#</title><content type="html">I've always gone by what the GPL FAQ has to say on this subject.

&lt;br /&gt;The GPL does not make plugins loaded by a GPL program GPL.  If that were true than any program loaded on Linux would automatically become open source, as it is being dynamically run by a GPL program (the Linux Kernel).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Your interpretation would also mean that GCC could not create commercial programs or programs with non-gpl licenses which is clearly not true.

&lt;br /&gt;But the distinction you're missing is the one they call out: whether the linkage is via library calls, or via fork/exec.

Read the FAQ: output of compilers is not GPL, unless the compiler copies substantial portions of itself into the output. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I think you're confusing compilation with dynamic linking. If the compiler were a GPL library, and I linked it with my program to produce something that called the compiler via a library call, then my program would indeed need to be licensed via the GPL if I chose to distribute it.

&lt;br /&gt;Merely running the compiler does not cause the output to be GPL, however, that doesn't change the fact that linking still works that way.

&lt;p&gt;So it seems that people are still reading &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig.DirectX/Direct3DTutorialIndex.html"&gt;my managed Direct3D tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, because last week I got three questions about it via email. Two of them, surprisingly, were exactly the same. Apparently, if you compile and run &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig.DirectX/DeviceRecoveryTutorial.html"&gt;the device recovery tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, you'll find that everything works great the first time you come back from hitting ctrl-alt-delete. But if you do it again, your application crashes with a Microsoft.DirectX.Direct3D.InvalidCallException during a call to Device.Present. Turning on the DirectX debug spew shows more details about the error: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2300: Direct3D9: (ERROR) :The following D3DPOOL_DEFAULT surfaces/buffers/textures still exist&lt;br /&gt;2300: Direct3D9: (ERROR) :  D3DRTYPE_VERTEXBUFFER&lt;br /&gt;2300: Direct3D9: (ERROR) :All user created D3DPOOL_DEFAULT surfaces must be freed before Reset can succeed. Reset Fails.&lt;br /&gt;2300: Direct3D9: (ERROR) :Reset failed and Reset/TestCooperativeLevel/Release are the only legal APIs to be called subsequently&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several weird things about this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It only happens the second time you lose the device. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It only happens if you lose the device via ctrl-alt-delete; you can alt-tab as many times as you like. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm pretty sure I'm freeing the VertexBuffer correctly. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I've discovered that it only happens if you create the VertexBuffer in the default pool. If you change to using Pool.Managed, the problem goes away. This makes sense, and is a reasonable workaround, but sometimes Pool.Managed isn't an option, so I'd like to figure out how to use Pool.Default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far here's what I've tried with no luck: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calling Marshal.Release on the VertexBuffer's underlying raw UnmanagedComPointer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calling Device.SetStreamSource(0, null, 0) after every render. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calling GC.Collect and GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers after Disposing of the VertexBuffer. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm rapidly running out of ideas. But I'll keep searching, and when I figure something out (or someone tells me what I'm doing wrong), I'll post a comment here and update the tutorial. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>41</thr:total></entry><entry><id>6704</id><published>2005-03-14T11:14:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-03-14T11:14:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Managed Direct3D InvalidCallException on Second Device Reset</title><content type="html">Well, a few things caught my eye..  First (in a 'nitpick' kinda way), the calls to TestCooperativeLevel are using exceptions as a flow control.. Would be better if you were using the 'CheckCooperativeLevel' methods performance wise..
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, back to the root of the problem.  The basic cause of this error is that you're creating n+1 vertex buffers (where n is the number of times the device has been reset), even though you're probably not aware of it..  By default, MDX will automatically dispose *and recreate* vertex and index buffers in the Pool.Default space..  The 'correct' way to handle this scenario is to hook the 'Created' event on the vertex buffer, do the lock/unlock code in that event handler, and get rid of the recreation of the vertex buffer you have. (see the 2nd d3d tutorial that ships with the sdk)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Or, since you're already 'handling' the situation yourself, you could simply turn off the MDX event handling by putting the code:
&lt;br /&gt;Device.IsUsingEventHandlers = false;
&lt;br /&gt;Somewhere before you create the device.  Doing this though, you'll lose the automatic 'reset' when resizing your form..
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Either way will work.

&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I know the exception is suboptimal. Writing the tutorials were my way of learning MDX, and that was something I figured out later. Never got a chance to go back and fix it. Perhaps I should overhaul that tutorial based on your feedback.

&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for some great tutorials.
&lt;br /&gt;Can't wait to see your update on device recovery tutorial!!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I've tried to implement Tom's corrections in your code but with no different result. Other samples that I've found on the web have not been optimal, e.g. using TestCooperativeLevel consequently at every frame. Trying to modify those all give the same result: an invalidCallException when calling Device.Reset.
&lt;br /&gt;(Using the Managed pool instead of the Default pool eliminates the problem, indicating that it is due to improper rescource handling.)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;By now I have tried everything. Giving up. I'm capitulating.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'll try to carve out some time this week to get the code working and the tutorial updated. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="6693"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>6875</id><published>2005-03-24T20:30:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-03-24T20:30:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Managed Direct3D InvalidCallException on Second Device Reset</title><content type="html">I'm working on my own separate project (didn't take a look at these tutorials) and I have the exact same problem.  I'm using Pool.Default for my VBs, and was recreating them every time I resetted the device.  Everything worked fine the first reset, but the 2nd reset caused a problem.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Basically, when I'd come back to the program when I alt tabbed (mine causes the error with alt tabbing), 
&lt;br /&gt;the CheckCooperationLevel returns a DeviceNotReset.  So I call Reset, and everything's beautiful.  Then I alt tab back out, then come back in.  Again, I get the DeviceNotReset, and try to reset it.  When I do, I get an InvalidCallException thrown at me.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I get this error even if I don't recreate my VBs.  Some of my VBs are dynamic, and it appears I can't used the Managed pool on these.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Hoping someone finds a solution,

My engine uses both dynamic and static VBs.  From playing around, it seems that I can only use the Managed Pool for the static VBs - Dynamic requires the Default Pool.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So, the 2nd Alt-Tab caused the problem of Reset throwing the InvalidCallException.  I found out that when I exit the program after Alt Tabbing only once, I get an error on exit.  So it seems that for some reason, the first Alt Tab works, but it throws DX in some unstable state. . . . either Alt Tabbing or exiting the program at that point causes problems.  I'd urge you to try the same thing.  Alt Tab just once, then exit the app, and see what happens.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;With the inclination that it was my VBs causing the problem, I started removing them out, one by one, until I was left with only one static (Pool.Managed) VB.  At that point, I could Alt Tab in and out as much as I wanted, and exits were clean.  As soon as I threw one dynamic VB in, I'd get the problem.  That has to be it!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I've tried Disposing and not Disposing the VB, and I get both problems.  I'm disposing right before I recreate the VB, in the same call.  So my two concerns are whether I need to do anything else besides simply call Dispose, and also if it's ok that I do everything in such proximity.  I noticed the tutorials do it in two separate events (finally looked over them).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So that's where I'm at, running in parallel with you guys, trying to figure this bug out.  Hopefully we can help eachother out.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Well, in my test, I'm not even locking or unlocking that particular VB anywhere.  I simply added the following line in the constructor of my class (as a test):
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;testBuffer = new VertexBuffer(typeof(TransformedColoredTextured), 2048, device, Usage.WriteOnly | Usage.Dynamic, TransformedColoredTextured.Format, Pool.Default);
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I keep a reference to it, so I'm guessing that as I alt tab, then DX should automatically create and destroy this VB,a nd I don't have to touch it ever.  However, the simple inclusion of that line causes the same alt-tabbing problem.  Commenting it out fixes everything.  Do I have to do something special since it's dynamic?

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;By default, MDX will automatically dispose *and recreate* vertex and index buffers in the Pool.Default space.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I thought that's what the Pool.Managed space was for.  I also tried creating a simple (non-dynamic) VB, and setting the space to Pool.Default.  I'd get the error.  I changed the pool to Pool.Managed.  No error.  So it seems as if there's something going on here that I'm missing. . . something extra I have to do for Default.

Knowing that I wasn't alone, I was inspired to dig a little deeper and I *might* (sort of) understand what's going on.  (Incidentally, I've been learning Direct3D over the past few weeks using, as it so happens, Craig's tutorials and Tom's book.  So, salutations gentlemen!)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;First, I’m wondering if Vic was having problems with Alt-Tab while Craig wasn’t simply because Vic’s app was running full-screen and Craig’s was in a window.  Is that the case, guys?  In any case, Alt-Tab causes the problem for me only when I’m in full-screen mode.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Second, the mysterious “only on second device reset” behavior isn’t quite so mysterious.  Assuming you’ve registered an “OnVertexBufferCreate” handler, you presumably had to call it yourself the first time.  When the device is reset after the first device loss, the Managed D3D run-time is calling your handler for the first time.  By adding some tracing code I found that it was calling my handler *twice*.  So, that’s when the error actually happens.  Direct3D doesn’t tank until the next time you try to reset the device.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So, I stepped through the disassembly a little and found some rather odd behavior in “VertexBuffer.OnParentReset”, a few frames down from my OnVertexBufferCreate handler.  Here’s the code:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;00000000  push        ebp  	// Step 7x???
&lt;br /&gt;00000001  mov         ebp,esp 	// Step 8x
&lt;br /&gt;00000003  sub         esp,0Ch 
&lt;br /&gt;00000006  push        edi  
&lt;br /&gt;00000007  push        esi  
&lt;br /&gt;00000008  push        ebx  
&lt;br /&gt;00000009  mov         esi,ecx 
&lt;br /&gt;0000000b  mov         edi,edx 
&lt;br /&gt;0000000d  xor         ebx,ebx 
&lt;br /&gt;0000000f  xor         ebx,ebx 
&lt;br /&gt;00000011  mov         ebx,edi 
&lt;br /&gt;00000013  cmp         dword ptr [esi+3Ch],0

&lt;br /&gt;00000036  call        dword ptr ds:[03BB8D40h] 	// Call to VertexBuffer.CreateObject
&lt;br /&gt;0000003c  nop              	// After call
&lt;br /&gt;0000003d  pop         ebx  	// Step 1x
&lt;br /&gt;0000003e  pop         esi  	// Step 2x
&lt;br /&gt;0000003f  pop         edi  	// Step 3x
&lt;br /&gt;00000040  mov         esp,ebp 	// Step 4x
&lt;br /&gt;00000042  pop         ebp  	// Step 5x
&lt;br /&gt;00000043  ret         4    	// Step 6x
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Once you step out of VertexBuffer.CreateObject, things are fairly normal.  However, when you hit “Step Over” for the seventh time, instead of returning into the frame below, for some reason the execution point jumps back to the start of the function.  Also, while the debugger behavior was fairly normal up until this point, for some reason you can now no longer use “Set Next Statement” – you just get a rather unhelpful popup saying “Unable to set the next statement to this location”.  If you step through the function, you find that the second time it does exit as expected.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I first encountered this with the Feb. 2005 SDK, but upgrading to the April release doesn’t change anything.  Can any of you reproduce this behavior?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why this is happening, but it does seem to explain the crash.  The only workaround I’ve found is to, as Tom suggested, set Device.IsUsingEventHandlers to false when I’m creating my VertexBuffers and treat them as volatile resources that must be released and restored manually.

&lt;br /&gt;I used the Garbagecollection (GC)-Class, to find out whats possible wrong and found some interesting (but don´t really know, if this matter in this case, but have a look : )
&lt;br /&gt;gc.GetGeneration(object) gives me the amount of locations, where a pointer points on a memory...(that, how i understand this function) ...if i create a vertexbuffer, the amount is 0 and if i fill it with the SetData-Command (or with lock/Unlock) the GetGenration-function returns 1.
&lt;br /&gt;If i touch the same buffer in one frame (or just after the creation) twice, the return is 2 ! Hahaa ...my hope rised...
&lt;br /&gt;Now i tried to block the second touch of the buffer (no regard to the incorrect result i got through this, cause my method sometimes need a second touch of the buffer (yet)). Now i tought all is fine and i had a grinn on my face but when i debugged further i was shocked: The programm creates more than one Vertexbuffer (ahmm....really.. ?:) and when i created an filled the second buffer the function returned a "2" on my first vertexbuffer... (i looked thousend times, its another buffer, but created from the same class).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Now i have "Die Fresse voll" (This is german, dont know how explain that in english :) and i build in some compiler-statement to keep the old stuff and switch temporary all to managed code, which works without any problem (but managed is not really what i want).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this is a hint on the meesage, that not all localmem-stuff had been released....maybe the framework (or whatever component) is´nt able to count correctly. I checked the access on the buffer through building it as a property to set breakpoint on any access and debugged it step by step. I found no further reference builded on the buffer.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Maybe someone else with more knowlegde can tell me if this assuming may correct or on can solve the problem with this info.

God, it's been too long), well, since Tom Miller finally gave us a render loop that actually works well. (i.e. I changed my current loop to match his, it works very nice in conjuction with the NativeWindow class btw). 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;However, it messed up my Alt+Tab code.  Well, it didn't work that great to begin with, as it was too convoluted to even imagine.  So, clearly I had to rewrite.  And hence the 4 days and here I am telling my life's story... 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the only solution I was able to find is to disable the events, this isn't so bad really.  The only thing -I- missed was the resize event, but using the NativeWindow class I was able to capture the WM_SIZE message and implement my own working Resize event.  I also use this class to capture the screen saver/power management crap as well.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if this will be fixed in the June SDK though?  It really should be as this appears to be a nasty bug.

If it were my code, that error should and would have come up on the first alt+tab (and, in fact it has due to my not releasing resources when required, but was fixed readily enough).  However, on the 2nd Alt+Tab from fullscreen to windowed, it crashes handily with resource not freed errors.  Whatever's freeing this within Direct3D is not doing it the 2nd time around for whatever reason, even on a simple test this fails.  As for getting around it, I didn't get around it per-se, I merely followed the advice of others and disabled the events (which apparently are a performance penalty too).  Apparently the only way to get around this (according to Mr. Miller) is to do things in the create event.  But this apparently doesn't work (see comments above), and to me this is not optimal design.  I don't wish to use events to fill my vertex buffer with data.  Believe me, I have a habit to blame my own code before blaming Microsoft/DirectX and I've found bugs with DX before.  I have tried a million things to make this work, including options mentioned here.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This is a refreshing read, I thought I was alone on this one :o(. I have not been using DirectX or VB.Net long so I was assuming it was my problem. I’m using a sprite for rending text and textures and dynamic vertex buffers for lines and polygons, which means I’m stuck using pool.default.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;For me its only on the second reset that it stops running and points me to the device.reset line telling me its an invalid call. I’m yet to try turning of the event handlers as I have only just found this suggestion from Tom on here.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I was wondering if anyone had heard of this bug being fixed yet? Or if there is proven work around for the moment, as some seemed to be struggling with the one Tom suggested also.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Cheers

Here's what they said. DMXUT is the class framework they use in the tutorials, I believe. I can't remember what it stands for.  
&lt;br /&gt;=======================
&lt;br /&gt;What you are observing is a "by design" issue; hence the code is doing exactly what it is supposed to.  According to Tom, "The vertex buffer is being created multiple times on each reset (once by the MDX framework, once by the app itself). However, only one of them is being disposed correctly (the one MDX knows about) while the other is not.  Turning off the event hooking mechanism will stop this error from occurring, or by switching to the VertexBuffer created event method to fill the data."
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Tom's broader recommendation is to use DXMUT to do device initialization, since it does the "right thing" and (theoretically at least :-) it gets updated with an SDK revision if we have newer guidance.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;You can either:
&lt;br /&gt;A) use DXMUT (recommended)
&lt;br /&gt;B) quit using the event model and handle object lifetime yourself.
&lt;br /&gt;C) quit recreating the vertex buffer every lost/reset loop and instead use the Created event to 'refill' the vertex buffer's data on reset.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;A is (for obvious reasons) recommended, but C is shown in the tutorials.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I have had a good look at the DXMUT code suggested but im not sure if I can use it in its current state for my purpose. I have created a DX Control in VB.NET to be used on VB.NET forms. So I do not want it to create a window for me or apply my device to a window. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking the only way around this is to try and alter the code to work with my Control rather than a window. The downside is I will lose the added benifit of the DXMUT being updated as you mention.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the delay on this one but I was stuck testing most of last week. I had tried all three of the approaches you gave with no success really the best I could get was the same as you with it crashing on the second reset from using the tutorial. I could not get the DXMUT to work with my code and then turning off the event handlers did not work either, it prevented the crash but stopped the control from actually working. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I decided to have another look through it all on Friday afternoon and found the same again until I tried swapping over from the TestCooperativeLevel() to CheckCooperativeLevel() as Tom had suggested in his first post. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;E.g.
&lt;br /&gt;If _device.CheckCooperativeLevel = True Then
&lt;br /&gt;                _device.Present()
&lt;br /&gt;            Else
&lt;br /&gt;                DeviceLost = True
&lt;br /&gt;            End If
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;By using this instead along with the approach you show in the tutorials(C), I seem to have solved the problem and it is recovering every time fine just minus the existing data which is to be expected.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So if you or others are still having problems getting it to work then I would advise using the tutorial approach but using CheckCooperativeLevel() instead.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the help on this on Craig, I hope this information is of use to you.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;All seems to be going well since i swapped to using the device.CheckCooperativeLevel() instead of TestCooperativeLevel(). Since then I have removed the DeviceLost boolean completely and used another check in its place in render to trigger recovery as i was still getting into the render loop.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I have however encountered a problem with disposing my vertexbuffers. I have been using VB.dispose() as you suggest in your tutorials but now I am getting past the second reset I have found that after the 20th or so Reset I am running out of video memory. So obviously the .dispose() method is not actually freeing up the space as expected on the GFX card.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Following a good search of the API/web, and having tried setting them to nothing, I have not been able to prevent this gfx memory leak.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Any ideas on this one?

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I suspect the answer (short of going to MDXUT, which I don't like as an answer) is going to revolve around turning off the event handlers.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Cheers for that Craig you were spot on with that diagnoses. MDX was recreating my VertexBuffers and I was as well in the SetUpDevice() method as per tutorial. Rather than turning off EventHandling I have opted to just move my VertexBuffer creation to the InitializeGraphics() method instead, which prevents it being called more than once. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;A quick recap for those looking for a solution like I was:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Using Craig's Device Recovery Tutorial:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;1) Replace calls to device.TestCooperativeLevel() with device.CheckCooperativeLevel().
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;2) Move the initialising of VertexBuffers from SetUpDevice() to InitailizeGraphics() as this will prevent u recreating the buffers each time as MDX will do it for you (helpfully?!).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;3) I found I had to replace the DeviceLost Boolean and comparisons with checks to the device.CheckCooperativeLevel() at the same places - this stopped a BSOD I was having due to it still entering the render method.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully when you come round to updating your tutorials you will find the same fixes as me solve your problem.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks for your help on this one Craig.

&lt;br /&gt;Fortunaly i kept the link to this page :)
&lt;br /&gt;"CheckCooperativeLevel" is the way !
&lt;br /&gt;btw I found another problem too:
&lt;br /&gt;One time a sized a vertexbuffer too small. i figured it out only when i had switched on all debug options. it was funny, when i had the wrong size i got a wrong error... until i found the error, then i got the real fault at that point: my vertexdeclaration was not setted at one point.
&lt;br /&gt;

If the least itty bitty thing goes out of sequence, the next thing it tells you is simply "Error in the Application."
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I cannot get satisfactory device reset behavior  with "Device.IsUsingEventHandlers = true" no matter what I do.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;For one, the Created event on the Vertex and Index buffers never fires. Never. At least not for Pool.Default buffers. It would be kind of handy if it did fire, from an encapsulation perspective. But it doesn't. If I do not clean up these vertex buffers outside this event, the renderer inevitably chokes on them the next frame.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;MDX sure must be doing SOMETHING, though, because if I manually release and re-create the buffers on a device reset, the application leaks memory like a seive on each device reset. After enough resets, the application bogs down terribly. I'm not convinced the problem is entirely due to unreleased buffers, either. That would cause the application to leak and degrade at an O(n) rate on each reset, for example, eating 500KB each reset. My observation is that it degrades at a O(n^2) rate on each reset. For example, the first device reset eats 500KB, the next eats an additional 1MB, the next an additional 2MB, etc.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In my situation, manually managing the release and re-creation of resources, plus setting "Device.IsUsingEventHandlers = false" is the only way I've found around all of these issues. All my resources are safely re-created, and no memory leaks occur. Now I can hit Ctrl-Alt-Del,  then Esc like a kid jumping on a trampoline and my application does not flinch.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="6693"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>29730</id><published>2006-07-05T04:03:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-07-05T04:03:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Managed Direct3D InvalidCallException on Second Device Reset</title><content type="html">It *is* somewhat fragile.

The barrier to my second device reset was a couple of vertex buffers that I was creating in one of my classes. I was using the VertexBuffer.Created events to automatically restore these when the device was reset and I was disposing them in the owning class's Dispose() method. After much head-scratching, I noticed that during the first device reset, the VertexBuffer.Created handlers were being called AFTER the owning class had been disposed. After much further head-scratching, my solution was to check whether the owning object had been disposed in my VertexBuffer.Created handlers and, if it had, Dispose the vertex buffer that was passed to the handler in the sender argument (see code snippet below). My theory is that ManagedD3D helpfully re-creates these buffers even if no Created handler has been supplied, which might explain the orignal problem.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;private void OnBufferCreated(object sender, EventArgs e)
&lt;br /&gt;{
&lt;br /&gt; VertexBuffer buffer=(VertexBuffer)sender;
&lt;br /&gt; if(this.m_bIsDisposing)
&lt;br /&gt; {
&lt;br /&gt;  buffer.Dispose();
&lt;br /&gt; }
&lt;br /&gt; else
&lt;br /&gt; {
&lt;br /&gt;  // initialise buffer here

Quite entertaining in a sadistic manner.  
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from the same problem but with slightly different behaviour (inconsistent crashes). Let me first describe how I am "handling" device loss:
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;=&amp;gt; I use:
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;  if(!device.CheckCooperativeLevel())
&lt;br /&gt;statements to determine if I have lost the device (before entering routines that use the device)
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;=&amp;gt; I use a try-catch statement about my devie.present() call to catch a DeviceLostException.
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;=&amp;gt; I have hooked the VertexBuffer.Created and VertexBuffer.Disposing methods (in addition to device lost, etc).
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;=&amp;gt; I do not new or dispose of my vertex/index buffers.  Instead, I re-fill my buffers with the appropriate data from within the vertexbuffer.created events
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;=&amp;gt; Finally, and most important, I output lines to the console whenever I get a VertexBuffer.Created or VertexBuffer.Disposing event.
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;My results are extremely interesting (again, in a sadistic manner):
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;SOMETIMES, it does not fail.  In cases that do not fail, the number of Created events is 1 and is matched by exactly 1 Disposing event.
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;BUT WHEN IT DOES FAIL, my log indicates that my VertexBuffer.Created event is getting called a minimum of twice.  Here on my screen now, I have record of VertexBuffer.Created being called 4 times!
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So is this a bug or not?  I am working on a project that requires a solution to this problem.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I've been fighting with this problem with my MD3D app. In my case, a windowed app was crashing after a screensaver was cancelled. After some experimentation I realised it was associated with switching window stations (what happens when you press Ctrl+Alt+Del or run a screensaver).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased to uncover your blog however I wasn't satisfied with the workarounds nor MS's assertion that the behaviour is by design. After some poking around with .NET reflector I'm confident that it's a bug in the MD3D layer.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The bug centres on how the VertexBuffer objects are recreated when the device is lost. Here's some code from the VertexBuffer object.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;private void OnParentLost(object sender, EventArgs e) {
&lt;br /&gt;    if (m_Pool == Pool.Default)
&lt;br /&gt;    {
&lt;br /&gt;        Dispose();
&lt;br /&gt;        if ((sender != null) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Device.IsUsingEventHandlers)
&lt;br /&gt;        {
&lt;br /&gt;            sender.DeviceLost += new EventHandler(OnParentLost);
&lt;br /&gt;            sender.DeviceReset += new EventHandler(OnParentReset);
&lt;br /&gt;            sender.Disposing += new EventHandler(OnParentDisposed);
&lt;br /&gt;        }
&lt;br /&gt;    }
&lt;br /&gt;}
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;public override unsafe void Dispose()
&lt;br /&gt;{
&lt;br /&gt;    if (this != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !m_bDisposed)
&lt;br /&gt;    {
&lt;br /&gt;        raise_Disposing(this, EventArgs.Empty);
&lt;br /&gt;        m_bDisposed = true;
&lt;br /&gt;        if (parentDevice != null&amp;amp;&amp;amp; Device.IsUsingEventHandlers)
&lt;br /&gt;        {
&lt;br /&gt;            parentDevice.DeviceLost -= new EventHandler(OnParentLost);
&lt;br /&gt;            parentDevice.DeviceReset -= new EventHandler(OnParentReset);
&lt;br /&gt;            parentDevice.Disposing -= new EventHandler(OnParentDisposed);
&lt;br /&gt;        }
&lt;br /&gt;            
&lt;br /&gt;        if (m_lpUM != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; m_lpUM.Release() == 0)
&lt;br /&gt;            m_lpUM = null;
&lt;br /&gt;                  
&lt;br /&gt;        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
&lt;br /&gt;    }
&lt;br /&gt;}
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;OnParentLost() is called when the device raises a lost event. This cleans up the unmanaged interface pointer (m_lpUM), tears down the event handlers and resubscribes to the event notifications. This is fine apart from that it doesn't guard against being called more than once before the device has been reset. This is exactly what happens with the standard example code. If Device.Present() fails because of a D3DERR_DEVICELOST error, it raises the device lost event. Later on, when Device.Reset() is called, it raises the event again regardless of what's gone on before. The problem is that VertexBuffer.OnParentLost() doesn't unsubscribe the events on the second call (because m_Disposed is false) but does subscribe to the events again. This means that it will receive two notifications on each event. When VertexBuffer handles the device reset event, it recreates the unmanaged vertex buffer. There's no state management and the vertex buffer is created twice. Member variables are over  written and it loses track of one of the instances. Double the amount of VB memory is allocated but this doesn't stop things working immediately. It's when the device is lost for the second time that things go wrong. The framework has lost track of some unmanaged VertexBuffer objects so doesn't know it needs to release them. However we can't call Device.Reset() until these interfaces have been released. Consequently we see "All user created D3DPOOL_DEFAULT surfaces must be freed before Reset can succeed"
&lt;br /&gt;and the call fails with a D3DERR_INVALIDCALL error.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The way to avoid the problem is to prevent the faulty code being executed. Checking the cooperation level before calling Device.Present() prevents the call raising a device lost event. Not using event handlers prevents the vertex buffer being created twice.

Although only a moron would actually do this, I'm learning a lot along the way. One of the toughest bits of it is to correctly implement word wrapping, particularly because I want to get it right not just for ASCII characters, but for others as well, like East Asian languages. (While I may be a moron, I'm not insane: I'm using the &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/uniscribe/default.htm"&gt;Uniscribe&lt;/a&gt; API to do all the hard parts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my challenges is that I don't always know what the “right” way to do something is. For example, should there be an invisible character representing the newline that shows up when drag selecting? Should the width of this character count against word wrapping? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced with a challenge like this, I often fire up another program and see what its authors decided to do. One of these that I frequently consult is Word. Another is Notepad. I figure I ought to at least be able to provide what Notepad does, and at best I'd match the capabilities of Word (although I'm not quite so mad as to actually target that). Well, tonight as I was trying to work out the kinks in my word breaking algorithm, I saw an interesting quirk in Notepad's line breaking capabilities. It surprised me because I assume Notepad to be one of the most mature pieces of software in Windows. Anyway, try this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire up Notepad. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure that Word Wrap is enabled. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type some gibberish that has some spaces in it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As soon as you type something that wraps to the next line, start hitting backspace. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that backspacing to the point where the word that wrapped becomes short enough that it could fit on the previous line does not actually “unwrap“. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marvel that the amount of utility in this information is so small as to be undetectable by modern scientific instruments. :) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>35</thr:total></entry><entry><id>6811</id><published>2005-03-19T20:13:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-03-19T20:13:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: &amp;amp;quot;Interesting&amp;amp;quot; Notepad Bug</title><content type="html">I think that most "power users" and developers don't use notepad much (I use notepad2) and most likely they are the only ones who might worry about such a thing.

&lt;br /&gt;-- start notepad
&lt;br /&gt;-- disable wordwrap, if not already
&lt;br /&gt;-- enable statusbar
&lt;br /&gt;-- type some junk
&lt;br /&gt;-- (re)enable wordwrap

&lt;br /&gt;What? No statusbar?  Try to reenable it. No can do!

&lt;br /&gt;I have it on good authority that notepad was misreporting the line number when ww was enabled, this bug was only noticed shortly before XP shipped, and the only thing they could do w/o resetting escrow testing was to disable the statusbar+wordwrap combo.  Groan..

&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time, I have been using notepad to write HTML documents. I usually turn Word Wrap on. During the use, misterious bugs showed up in Notepad - sometimes the cursor can be moved to some position where nothing exists, and if I typed something, they would appear together with some text on the next line. In the end, I found it is that when a file is saved, it updated the word wrapped layout internally (with something just you said, type some gibberish that has some spaces in it, and then backspace to), but it did not refresh the display.

&lt;br /&gt;How come such an *obvious* bug of such a useful application can be let unfixed ?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this is not a ludicrous Vista vs Notepad comparison... Notepad could be fixed in 10 minutes, it just show in which spirit microsoft develops its applications.
&lt;br /&gt;Notepad is so simple its flaws can be easily detected ; but what about the internal kernel of an OS? it's a black box where nobody but some engineers can look inside (unlike Linux that can be seen by anybody)... 
&lt;br /&gt;I agree the reliability of the OS is increasing, but what does it cost? Why is it slow? Why "wine" on Linux does the same thing faster? Because you cannot see inside bugs fixed with "band aid". 
&lt;br /&gt;If Notepad fails, "well just dont use the word wrap option", what if the OS fails? The computer stops, so it has to be fixed.

&lt;br /&gt;I'm a big fan of open source. I've worked on several major projects myself. And interestingly, I find that the quality of open source is generally far worse than that of Microsoft's software. There are a few exceptions, but that's the general rule.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="6810"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>15036</id><published>2005-09-25T21:11:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-09-25T21:11:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: &amp;amp;quot;Interesting&amp;amp;quot; Notepad Bug</title><content type="html">I must agree that MS did some good stuff, Excel for instance (while openOffice is great as well... and free.)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about open source is that everybody (meaning all developpers) can fix bugs, or implements their own version. The bad think is that some software fit only the needs of a particular home developper where no manager had to cope with requirements and explain himself to somebody. And some useful programs are really painful for that (being too specific and not coping with general needs).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;However the main MS softs get a good equivalent on the open source side (eg did you check out the latest SuSE?). And I prefer a less "sexy" tool that is free and that is customizable than something expensive and opaque.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Well, being a developper myself, working on both platforms, let me tell you that the MS tendancy to keep its software structure as a black box is really annoying. MS became such a big company that their APIs and documentation lack of consistency. Most of the time, I better get the free open source library to fit my needs than trying to cope with MS specifities/inconsistencies/ambiguous doc/bugs/"need to upgrade to latest $$ version" not mentioning the weirdness of some of their internal implementations...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;From the user side, Windows is used at so many places that anyone will always (for the time being) be able to find a needed program to do something in particular. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;From a developper perspective, MS shows a lot of weaknesses which are not visible from the outside: their management. Imho, MS gets a handle (or a bit more) of very competent people working on the OS kernel in a well managed structured team. For the rest, including the top, they grew during the very profitable years of MS (say, up to a few years from now) and have no idea of what is a good management. How could they personnaly acknowledge this, especially while the company is still making a huge profit (resting on their laurels)...? Time will tell.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Imho, MS key people, being insanely paid, will feel more and more the terrible frustration of being in this company *only* for the money. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;What makes a good movie is first its direction, not (only) the money that can be invested in. 
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;Microsoft has a lot of money.  This may sound harsh, but if they didn't have the competence to fix Notepad in a timely fashion (how many years has it been now since XP was released?  3? 4?), then they should simply have bought out a working notepad program from some small company.

&lt;br /&gt;I use Notepad++ to replace Notepad :
&lt;br /&gt;http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The reason I use Notepad++ is its MDI (Multi-Document Interface just like firefox).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;To replace your notepad by notepad++, you have to :
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;1. Download and install Notepad++ :
&lt;br /&gt;http://internap.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/notepad-plus/npp.3.9.Installer.exe
&lt;br /&gt;2. Download Notepad++ launcher :
&lt;br /&gt;http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/commun/misc/NppLauncher.bin.zip
&lt;br /&gt;3. Copy notepad.exe which comes with this package into 3 directories (in given order) :
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;i. c:\windows\system32\dllcache
&lt;br /&gt;ii. c:\windows\system32
&lt;br /&gt;iii. c:\windows
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;When you replace notepad.exe in c:\windows\system32 and c:\windows, a "Windows File Protection" message box appears, click Cancel. Then another message box appears, click OK.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Now Notepad++ is your default Notepad.

&lt;br /&gt;-- disable wordwrap, if not already
&lt;br /&gt;-- enable statusbar
&lt;br /&gt;-- type some junk
&lt;br /&gt;-- (re)enable wordwrap
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;What? No statusbar? Try to reenable it. No can do!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I have it on good authority that notepad was misreporting the line number when ww was enabled, this bug was only noticed shortly before XP shipped, and the only thing they could do w/o resetting escrow testing was to disable the statusbar+wordwrap combo. Groan.. "
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This is complete rubbish - if you enable line-wrapping and line numbering together you have a conflict of interest.  Do you split the line numbers such that there are gaps when wrapping occurs or do you ignore the wrapping and ensure there are no gaps in the line numbers - MS made the decision not to allow the conflict, it's NOT a bug!</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="6810"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>45818</id><published>2007-01-23T02:56:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-23T02:56:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: &amp;amp;quot;Interesting&amp;amp;quot; Notepad Bug</title><content type="html">"Microsoft has a lot of money.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely right, Richard.  Microsoft has made its billions by ripping people off.  Fundamental functionality (e.g. search in Explorer) has been broken and never fixed for years. Gates and Ballmer are rich because they are nothing more than criminals.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you look at any individual or company that has accumulated fantastic amounts of money, you'll see there is always some sort of criminal activity at work. It may not strictly be against the letter of the law, but these people should not be sleeping soundly, as they have swindled millions of innocent individuals.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="6810"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>48089</id><published>2007-07-26T04:35:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-07-26T04:35:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">err..! check this as well..!</title><content type="html">This day I too encountered some issue with notepad.. donno whether this is a bug or an issue with my machine..!

As soon as you go outside of ASCII text, 90% of the editors in the world - while nice and full of features - either crash or display junk. Another 9% of editors will handle UTF-8 as well, but not non-Unicode MBCS (multi-byte character sets, such as Chinese).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Even Emacs, the supposed benchmark of hard-code text editing, still cannot handle Unicode properly, 20 years later.

&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;An Indian discovered that nobody can create a FOLDER anywhere on the computer  which can be named as "CON". This is something pretty cool...and unbelievable... At Microsoft the whole Team, couldn't answer why this happened! 
&lt;br /&gt;TRY IT NOW ,IT WILL NOT CREATE " CON " FOLDER
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Folders with name: CON, PRN, AUX, CLOCK$, NUL, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5,
&lt;br /&gt;COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, &amp;amp; LPT9
&lt;br /&gt;cant be created using Windows Explorer or Command Prompt directly! ( Try this
&lt;br /&gt;out.. right click on your desktop and try creating folder named "con"it changes
&lt;br /&gt;back to "ew Folder" )
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This is prevented as XP terms these folders as SYSTEM Folder Names reserved only
&lt;br /&gt;for the Operating System.. But there is a backdoor...(this trick is to create
&lt;br /&gt;system folders on XP through command prompt )
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; Try this:
&lt;br /&gt;CREATION
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Syntax:md \\.\\$path
&lt;br /&gt;Example:prompt&amp;gt;md \\.\\C:\con
&lt;br /&gt;Explanation: This would create a folder named "con" on your "C Drive"
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Similarly to delete such folder:
&lt;br /&gt;DELETION
&lt;br /&gt;Syntax:rd/s \\.\\$path
&lt;br /&gt;Example:prompt&amp;gt;rd/s \\.\\C:\con
&lt;br /&gt;Explanation: This would remove the folder named "con"!
&lt;br /&gt;Note: rd(Remove Directory) command is used with "/s" switch as otherwise it
&lt;br /&gt;would give error that "folder is not empty"!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;On another hand...if you ever wondered how to create a folder with no
&lt;br /&gt;name...then try this:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Create a New Folder from Windows Explorer
&lt;br /&gt;Select rename &amp;amp; type: "ALT+255"(Use Numpad)..that’s it!
&lt;br /&gt;ALT+255 stand for blank character in ASCII...so it still accepts your folder name!

We have a fairly extensive list of features that we want to implement to get there. Some of them are done, but many of them are not. Although we build on every checkin, and &lt;a href="http://builds.flexwiki.com/"&gt;make every build available&lt;/a&gt; to the brave, we were hoping that we would be able to jam through the remaining 2.0 features via a coherent push to get a new version of FlexWiki “blessed” as the official release sometime soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, we came to the realization that it's still going to take some time to get to 2.0. And in the meantime, real users are having problems with build 1613 (the last “official” release), to which the answer is most often, “Oh yeah, we fixed that since November. Upgrade to the latest interim build.” At some point, we realized that it made more sense to simply make the latest build the official release and keep driving towards 2.0. “Release early, release often” is a good motto for open source projects to have. So that's what I spent part of today doing: you can now &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=315557"&gt;download FlexWiki 1.8.0.1677 from SourceForge&lt;/a&gt;. Here are the release notes I posted, in case you were wondering what goodies have been added: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font color="#006400"&gt;This release contains many, many new features and bugfixes. Here is a
partial listing. See the change notes for a complete history. Thanks
to the many contributors who wrote all these goodies in their spare
time. 

* Added support for colored text via the %color% tag.

* A completely rearchitected storage engine that allows for pluggable
  stores. 

* An implementation of the pluggable storage engine that allows a
  namespace to be stored in SQL Server. 

* RSS feed format improvements. 

* A new URL scheme. Topics can now be accessed using URLs like
  http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/Namespace/TopicName

* Fixed newsletter functionality. 

* Improved anti-spam technology, like nofollow support and URL
  blacklisting.

* Improved testing - the automated build installs FlexWiki and
  verifies correct behavior via a browser. 

* Support for page and page fragment templates. 

* Many WikiTalk improvements, including improvements to forms-building
  support. 

* Improved support for Windows 2000 installation. 

* Support for setting page title using page's Title property. 

* Better support for Firefox. 

* Support for "breadcrumb" functionality to display user's
  most-recently-visited pages in a sidebar. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>10</thr:total></entry><entry><id>6885</id><published>2005-03-25T10:23:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-03-25T10:23:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Rilasciato FlexWiki 1.8.0.1677</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="6884"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>7031</id><published>2005-03-28T23:36:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-03-28T23:36:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">FlexWiki 1.8.0.1677 Released</title><content type="html">My favourite open source project FlexWiki has just updated the public release to 1.8.0.1677.

Instead, you always have to write at least four: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's the app itself. This is the thing that the user runs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's the tests. These will generally be about the same size as the app. Yes, a 20,000 line application will usually have 20,000 lines of test code. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's the build. Truly an application in itself (albeit usually not quite as big as the test code) it needs to deal with all the weird third party crap, odd test scenarios, and specialized hacks. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's the installer. If you're very lucky, this is a zipfile. Usually, you're not lucky. If not, you're looking at a significant effort to make sure it works right - uninstall, unattended install, rollback on failure partway through, blah blah blah. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and there's the documentation, too, although I didn't list that since I haven't decided yet whether it qualifies as an application or not. Probably it does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these things is a major effort in and of itself for any nontrivial project. Each needs to be written, tested, patched, documented, and supported. This also means that the app itself represents well south of 50% of the code, and probably less than 30%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this just goes to justify the practice I've used for years: when someone asks me how long something will take, I estimate it in my head, and then multiply by four before telling them a number. It has worked surprisingly well. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>10</thr:total></entry><entry><id>7104</id><published>2005-03-29T06:24:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-03-29T06:24:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: There's No Such Thing As Just One Application</title><content type="html">&amp;lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pandrew/archive/2004/05/25/140656.aspx"&amp;gt;"There is only one program and it is still being written."&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="7102"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>7105</id><published>2005-03-29T06:31:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-03-29T06:31:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: There's No Such Thing As Just One Application</title><content type="html">Heh.

&lt;br /&gt;I know exactly what you are saying. I just thought it was funny. Very interesting, though, that you can break it into those specific areas. It is also definitely possible to break each application into certain things that each one does (or many, many applications do) / Data Access, Logging, UI, Messaging, etc. So, a lot of the time, we are writing very similar applications, at least in Enterprise stuff, but they have enough differences that we have to redo a lot of the work.

If I might be so bold as to summarize Ted's argument: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;XSLTO looks like AOP. Tim thinks XSLTO is good. Therefore, Tim thinks AOP is good. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This is so full of holes you could strain your pasta through it. It's a classic case of overgeneralization, and in and of itself that's enough to render his argument moot. However, I'd like to examine it in slightly more detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ted's basic argument is that since XSLTO uses declarative attributes to drive execution of code, and since AOP is based around more or less the same thing, that the two are equivalent. I disagree: XSLTO is a proper subset of what AOP advocates. It is a specific, specialized utilization of declarative programming. In this case, it's essentially a translation of XSLT into the C# realm, giving you the ability to process XML documents via recursive descent.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ted says: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;&lt;em&gt;And the richer and more flexible your pointcut/query system, obviously the more powerful your AOP system. This is why simple interception, such as the CORBA interceptor, .NET/COM+ context-bound attribute interceptor or Java dynamic proxy, is not a rich AOP system in the slightest--although powerful, it uses only one sort of joint point, and that in itself inherently limits your abilities. Imagine if OOP only allowed just one base class or interface; how useful would OOP be? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Still pretty damn useful, actually. I don't miss multiple inheritance in C#, despite it being a mainstay of C++. Adding more constructs to the language adds complexity, and that complexity adds cognitive overhead that can make the tool less useful in many situations. We have this conversation on the FlexWiki mailing lists all the time: people are constantly proposing extensions to the wiki syntax that bring it closer and closer to doing everything HTML can do. Of course, at some point you cross the line where you have to wonder why you should bother with having a wiki language at all? It's like Spider Man taught us: with great power comes great responsibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;(Side note: Multiple interface implementation is probably a borderline case - I suspect we could get by without it, but since it adds less complexity than multiple inheritance, the increased cognitive load is probably worth the extra capabilities. That is not always generally true. Figuring out when it is and when it isn't is what designing good abstractions is all about, and it's really, really hard.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Continuing. Quoting Ted: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;&lt;em&gt;As to the oft-quoted "killing blow" regarding AOP systems, that being that aspects cannot be ordered or stateful, it's interesting to note that people refuse to make similar accusations about XSLT, yet it (a) fundamentally presents much the same kind of programming model as an AOP-based system would, and (b) has similar problems with ordering and state, yet nobody's calling for XSLT to die.... &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ted, if you want to compare AOP to XSLT, be my guest. Programming in XSLT every day of my life for everything I do would be enough to make me want to switch to a career in marketing. Just like XSLTO and AOP, XSLT is a specialized tool useful for a few very narrow problems. And just like XSLTO and AOP, it should be viewed as - although perhaps not a last resort - something you only pull out when you have a specific need, not a general-purpose tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;At the end of the day, I guess what Ted and I disagree on is the extent to which AOP concepts are useful. I say, “very little, but not zero”, and he takes a view that is presumably much broader than that. I view XSLTO as a useful replacement for some of what XSLT does. And I view XSLT as a useful replacement for some of what the .NET XML APIs do. But most of the time I'm going to stick with my favorite API, XmlSerializer, and stay the hell away from frameworks that drive &lt;strong&gt;execution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; via declarative means. I take the same attitude towards (other) AOP frameworks: I'll use them when I've exhausted other options, and not before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;1. Yes, I realize XmlSerializer is declarative. But it's a declarative serialization engine, not a declarative execution engine. (That is, I don't need to debug into it except when I have problems, which is when it sucks the worst. But that just makes my point.) I have found this to be a very significant difference in practice. And again, a concept that is useful only in a narrow context. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>7201</id><published>2005-04-05T05:04:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-04-05T05:04:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Another Smart Guy Hits the AOP Crack Pipe</title><content type="html">I have no idea what I am talking about, but isn't AOP more geared toward the non-functional requirements in a project such as instrumentation and logging? </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="7188"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>7203</id><published>2005-04-05T06:39:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-04-05T06:39:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Another Smart Guy Hits the AOP Crack Pipe</title><content type="html">That's actually my point: AOP is useful in narrow scenarios, not as a general programming practice.

He's going to be helping to develop the next generation of GotDotNet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say, fantastic! First of all, you all know that &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/03/24/1271.aspx"&gt;I think GotDotNet sucks&lt;/a&gt;. I like &lt;a href="http://sf.net/"&gt;SourceForge&lt;/a&gt; much better, but not so much that I would mind seeing someone do something even better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Newkirk, if you're listening, here are my suggestions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support automation. GDN currently has &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; good ways to automatically check in/out. As an NUnit guy, I can imagine this is high on your list. :) 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Switch to a edit/merge/commit source control model. The SourceSafe lock/edit/checkin model has no place on teams where people sit more than three feet from each other. I'm pretty sure I know what you're using on the back end for source control, and it's awesome. Expose it. 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you absolutely must support lock/edit/checkin (to pander to all those frightened by the word “merge“), for the love of all that is technical, make it something I can turn off. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be an excellent start. If you can additionally &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide an interface for automating releases. 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide built-in continuous integration with excellent integration points. 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide well-integrated bug and feature tracking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you'll be a leg up on SourceForge, and I might consider switching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One piece of advice: avoid the Microsoft trap of thinking you have to write the whole thing from scratch. That's one of the reasons GDN sucks now. There are tons of good bits out there that already do a lot of what we need (e.g. CruiseControl.NET). Note: I will be highly suprised if this actually happens. Microsoft culture is pretty bad on this count - I think you get sprayed with NIH spores when you walk through the door. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, I wish you the best of luck. The worst-case scenario for me here is that SourceForge steals some of your ideas and makes my experience even better. So I win either way. :) &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>7220</id><published>2005-04-05T21:04:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-04-05T21:04:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Fixing GotDotNet?</title><content type="html">wkssync provides command line access to GDN workspaces: http://www.gotdotnet.com/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=b3fb58ff-363b-4d0d-9f42-4946d86a19eb</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="7197"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>7226</id><published>2005-04-06T03:53:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-04-06T03:53:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Fixing GotDotNet?</title><content type="html">I'm aware of wkssync.

I am not sure what the actual goal of Workspaces are but I imagine it's supposed to be like sourceforge.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;1 - Make it easy to find projects you are interested in, uh how about a search?  If there is a search then redesign the website so I can find it.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;2 - This isn't really a workspace only idea but a general software configuration management issue and goes along with the idea of continuous integration... (ala CrusieControl.NET).  Why do we have to diff files and remember to checkin files?  Couldn't there be some type of automated background task (like autosaving the file on my local machine) that checks that the file builds and passes unit tests and fxcop test and if everything looks good it's checked in for me?   As long as it doesn't break the build it's okay to checkin.  Maybe this is too space age, somebody tell me if I'm off my rocker.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;3 - Uptime and responsiveness!  I can't recall the number of times I've tried to get on GOTDOTNET and had it greet me with either unresponsive page loads or a technical difficulities message.  Eeek!?  You could do all the ASP.NET performance whitepapers you want but if you can't build an awesome asp.net app you aren't doing yourself any favors!

I should have known it, but I missed it, and it's worth spreading around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user complained that their FlexWiki install would periodically respond very slowly. The wiki was under very light load, so it didn't seem like a traffic problem. I was initially a bit confused, because the user reported that they hadn't changed the &amp;lt;processModel&amp;gt; element. Changing &amp;lt;processModel&amp;gt; to recycle the ASP.NET worker process periodically would have explained the problem, but the default is not to do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, &lt;a href="http://michaelteper.com/"&gt;Michael Teper&lt;/a&gt; pointed out what I should have remembered: under IIS6, &amp;lt;processModel&amp;gt; is ignored in favor of the IIS6 metabase settings. If you go into the Internet Services Manager and pull up properties for an application pool, you'll see right there that by default, IIS will recycle the worker process every 29 hours (yes, 29), &lt;strong&gt;and &lt;/strong&gt;after 20 minutes of inactivity. So on a lightly-loaded server, you're going to see a lot of recycling, and the consequent periodic delays. If you're supporting an internal web server that doesn't get hit that often, changing this value might be a good idea. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>7695</id><published>2005-04-24T06:42:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-04-24T06:42:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Periodic Slowness in ASP.NET Apps</title><content type="html">Oh wow!

Since they're writing a host process, they are in the unfortunate position of having the perceived stability of IIS depend on all the crappy, leaky, buggy apps that people run under it. So it is perhaps understandable that they set the default to this, assuming that any *real* system would be administered by someone that knows better.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;VSS will be part of the appropriate MSDN subscription or with the Team System version. I believe this was the case in the past also: I remember buying Visual Basic Enterprise Edition years ago and that coming with VSS whereas my Visual C++ Professional didn't.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The Visual Studio 2005 Professional with MSDN Premium subscription (or whatever it is actually called - something like that) will include VSS once it has been fixed to do so (it didn't in the original descriptions but has been changed as the result of feedback). In other words, this will be the equivalent to the current MSDN Universal subscription.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The stream and workspaces concept works much better for parallel development and the promotion model than the tools that were never designed to support such process. Old school tools need complicated branch, merge and labelling processes and scripts to get it 'right'.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And the negative comments on this blog probably come from programmers who would prefer not to have any SCM at all.

&lt;br /&gt;Although I have had my share of issues with VSS, I haven't had any of the issues with VSS 2005 with the http and lan assistant.  For a small team, I personally think this is the way to go.  Managing merging files is just a pain, and generally not worth it in a small team.  If you are a Microsoft shop, the integration also just makes it easier.  VSS is designed for SMALL groups though, and it doesn't make any claims at being an enterprise source control tool.  If you have more than 5 developers working on projects at the same time, get something else.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I also use Subversion with some of my customers that subcontract me, and the Ankh pluggin for it works pretty well.  You definitely want to go through the Subversion manual though, since some operations like moving files and folders have to be done through the svn client rather than being integrated fully through the IDE like they would be for VSS.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford them, Team System has very nice version control that integrates well with their issue control system.  AccuRev is a similar product that has issue/feature tracking and source control.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="7721"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>47174</id><published>2007-05-03T01:34:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-05-03T01:34:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Visual Source Safe and Visual Studio 2005?</title><content type="html">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; some operations like moving files and folders have to be done through the svn client

Not that I hate Perforce - it is a good tool. Just that there are lots of little administrative headaches and gotchas that Accurev just takes care of for you. If you have to admin the system yourself, and there are any number of users, consider it.

While I agree that the Java UI can be slow and klunky (like every Java UI I have ever used), I've worked in enterprise software for a long time and have had to use Accurev on Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX and HP-UX, and I have _never_ seen a problem with any of the CLI on any platform. 

And about being confusing and unintuitive; I have personally trained dozens of developers to use Accurev over the years, and we never had any problems with any of them understanding the concepts of code flow and streams. On the contrary, people usually get it immediately because it IS more intuitive than the old RCS-based systems are. But then again, I guess if your users have sub-average IQs, maybe you should stay away from Accurev ;-P~

The product is extremely easy to set up, use, maintain and administer.  

I evaluated AccuRev/PVCS/SVN/Perforce.  Once I saw the demo for AccuRev, I knew that if I could reproduce what the demo did then it was a no brainer decision.  I rolled out AccuRev(4.6.2) almost 8 months ago bringing over 40+ load lines to an engineering department of almost 100.  I had NO deployment problems.   

The online videos that are on their website are a great training guide.  I point all of our new developers to them to give them a good overview of AccuRev.   If I get a question that I am not 100% sure of the answer, I contact the support staff at AccuRev.   They always provide a quick answer.

The GUI is so easy to use that a couple of our users that were going to use the CLI decided to stick with the GUI.  Performance is NOT an issue.  Our developers have never once complained about the speed of the GUI..even when used remotely.  

I must admit, the product has practically paid for itself in both developer time saved and my time savings. I wish I would have heard about AccuRev a few years ago because it has made my job as SCM manager less stressful!  

I could go on and on about the benefits of AccuRev when it comes to parallel development/merging/diffs/stream branching/etc, but I suggest you check it out for yourself.

FYI: I do not work for AccuRev, I only am a very happy user of the product.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="7721"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>55738</id><published>2008-12-17T08:11:08.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-12-17T08:11:08.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Visual Source Safe and Visual Studio 2005?</title><content type="html">I've used SCCS, RCS, CVS SVN, some ClearCase, and AccuRev.

Out of all of them, I tend to like AccuRev the most. At least for me, the stream architecture was very intuitive: I "got" AccuRev by the end of our first technical demo. Perhaps it's because I was more familiar with a wide array of source control tools compared to most. However I did notice that the people we had coming from CVS seemed to have an easier time understanding how AccuRev works when compared to their ClearCase counterparts.

I would love to know what the specific problems are. We started converting our group on 4.6, and have upgraded to 4.7. The only problems we've seen is when people expect AccuRev to work exactly like whatever source control system they came from, which obviously isn't a reasonable expectation.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="7721"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>7752</id><published>2005-04-26T09:18:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-04-26T09:18:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">This Blog Now Requires CAPTCHA</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've had some fairly serious problems with comment spam on this blog - literally hundreds of bogus comments on some days.

&lt;br /&gt;Yes, clearly it's not a spam filter. Just a bot filter. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="7752"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>7783</id><published>2005-04-27T06:57:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-04-27T06:57:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Making iTunes Work with MSN Messenger's &amp;amp;quot;Now Playing&amp;amp;quot; Feature</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On a recommendation from &lt;a href="http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com"&gt;Brad Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, I've switched from using WMP to iTunes. I'm not sure I'm going to stick with it, but so far I like it. But one problem that was bugging me was how to get the “Now Playing” feature of MSN Messenger 7.0 working. I had it working for a little while, but then it stopped and I couldn't get it back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I've got it working now. After a little Googling, I found the answer &lt;a href="http://tech.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_5958.php?compage=10&amp;amp;comcount=20&amp;amp;comlimit=10"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Here's the important bit: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;&lt;em&gt;In MSN Messenger go to Tools / Options / General and check "Open Messenger main window when Messenger starts." &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This rates as one of the more bizarre fixes I've seen, but so far it's working perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the spirit of this post, here are my five most recently played songs. Clearly, I've got my whole library on “shuffle“. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;I'm using Messenger v8.0 and I don't seem any problem.My iTunes and WMP works fine with it.
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;As for WMP,you'll need to set up the "Now Playing" features in:
&lt;br /&gt;Tools&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Options&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Plug-Ins&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;and at the right panel,there's a plug-ins named "background",click on that and check the box for anything with the name MSN or messenger.
&lt;br /&gt;Done.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you cant get MSN to show what your listening to, it means MSN or itunes or both are missing files.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So all you have to do is go to MSN and download messenger again... you dont need to uninstall first MSN will ask you if you want to remove or repair messenger, click repair. After the repair is complete it will ask you to restart your computer click restart later.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Then go to apple.com and install the latest version of itunes...once again you will not need to uninstall before doing this, apple will ask you if you want to repair or remove itunes, click repair.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;after you have repaired itunes restart you computer. Once restarted open MSN and itunes and play a song it should work then.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;if not then you can follow the regular steps. 
&lt;br /&gt;which are:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;For MSN:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Go to Tools, then click on Options... in the drop down menu, then check the "show song information from Windows Media Player in Personal message"
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Then...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;For itunes:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Go to Edit, the click on Perfrences, then go to the advanced TAB then make sure that minimize itunes to system tray is UNCHECKED, then hit ok.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;You should then right click on your taskbar (if you dont know what that is.... it is the bar at the buttom of you screen with the time and all your open windows). When you right click on the taskbar a pop-up window will show, move the cursor over Toolbars and make sure that itunes is CHECKED (this will thereby enable itunes).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;YOUR ALL DONE. I did all of this and it worked, so if this doesnt work for you then you are in my prayers cuz i know you must be frustrated :(

If you want to know how to fix iTunes/MSN Messenger, read on....
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;First - open task manager and go to the process list. Next, find and "End Process" on the following applications: MSN messenger (msnmsgr.exe), iTunes (iTunes.exe) &amp;amp; windows media player (can't remember what it's called but it is specified similarly). Now start up iTunes &amp;amp; MSN messenger in any order you like - I don't know what these people are talking about order of start up for, there are no dependancies between the 2 applications so this makes no sense.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In fact I think that simply closing the mediaplayer process completely should achieve the same effect, the problem seems to be with the plugin being written by a moron as opposed to an issue with either iTunes or MSN messenger, if the mediaplayer process is in the list but you don't have media player open then you have found the bug with the plugin. 
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;It's quite easy. First, you set all your music types to be listened to with iTunes. I think that it can work even if you don't do that.
&lt;br /&gt;Then, you do control + alt + Del to get your task manager. Then you look for wmplayer, windows media player, however your computer shows it as, and you end it's task.

If the programs access and defaults does not let you go on there, this is because you are not an administrator.

It should now work. You might have to go into the control panel and stop WMP from starting up everytime, you just need to disable it from starting up again.

All you need to do is set Itunes to your defalut player

instead of Windows Media Player. 
It automatically pops up as soon as i open itunes. But you can set it by going to- Edit-Preferences-advanced-
Then check the box that says - Use itunes as the default players for audio files:. This is all down in iTunes.

You will need administartive permission though so get the computers administrator to do this if you do not have permission on your computer account to do this.

While the above fix(es) might work because of the restarts, no amount of clicking options on or off will solve the problem. If you want to know how to fix iTunes/MSN Messenger, read on.... 

First - open task manager and go to the process list. Next, find and "End Process" on the following applications: MSN messenger (msnmsgr.exe), iTunes (iTunes.exe) &amp;amp; windows media player (can't remember what it's called but it is specified similarly). Now start up iTunes &amp;amp; MSN messenger in any order you like - I don't know what these people are talking about order of start up for, there are no dependancies between the 2 applications so this makes no sense. 

In fact I think that simply closing the mediaplayer process completely should achieve the same effect, the problem seems to be with the plugin being written by a moron as opposed to an issue with either iTunes or MSN messenger, if the mediaplayer process is in the list but you don't have media player open then you have found the bug with the plugin. 

Enjoy... and to the cowboy tech guys; if you don't know, don't make it up.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="7783"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>56550</id><published>2009-02-01T22:51:24.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-02-01T22:51:24.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Making iTunes Work with MSN Messenger's &amp;amp;quot;Now Playing&amp;amp;quot; Feature</title><content type="html">mm, it didn't really work, iunno

Even though you may not have it open, it is running in the background, not doing anything, but this process hijacks the song information being displayed by Messenger. 

Get us all up to speed: 

1. sign in to the most recent version of windows live messenger 
2. make sure the "show what i'm listening to" box is checked 
3. open iTunes and play music &amp;lt; important that music is playing 
4. check to see if music is shown in messenger 

no? 

The following steps close the windows media player service. 

To get it working again: 

1. ctr + alt + del 
2. (if this doesn't open the task manager, click task manager) 
3. go to the processes tab 
4. show processes from all users 
5. continue 
6. find wmplayer.exe *32 &amp;amp; WMPSideShowGadget.exe 
7. right click &amp;gt; end process tree (to both) 
8. click end process tree (to both) 
9. close the task manager 
10. check Windows Live Messenger to see if song information is being shown 

and it should work. 

if not - you may have another media player running a process i.e. spotify, winamp, vlc player, ...

Code First? Both First.</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The recent debate (&lt;a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/CommentView.aspx?guid=e1ab8978-f0a9-4913-bee3-badc1cbefbe5"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/aaron/archive/2005/04/25/7729.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/archive/2005/04/25/7712.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, amongst others) might lead you to believe there are two ways to design a web service: code-first and contract-first. A surface reading of the debate seems to indicate that you either write a bunch of classes and rely on the vendor to generate the XML (code-first) or write all your WSDL/XSD by hand (contract-first). This is utter crap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like anything else, it all comes down to &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html"&gt;Splosky's Law&lt;/a&gt;. Roughly paraphrased, it reads, “There is no free lunch.“ You don't get to ignore the wire format, and you don't get to ignore the tools. Instead, you have to remember things like, “&lt;a href="http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/2005/04/1530.html"&gt;CLR value types don't work very well in the face of missing elements, but Java works differently&lt;/a&gt;.“ You, lucky coder, have to remember that you're writing a system in which the parts might look something like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Georgia"&gt;Java &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; Axis &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; XML &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; HTTP &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; XML &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; System.Xml.Serialization &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; ASP.NET &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; C#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that every layer has its own oddities and idiosyncrasies. If you can do that by writing a pile of classes, great. But you simply won't be able to guarantee success unless you know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; those classes turn into XML. You might get lucky, but that's pretty much the same thing as saying, “Well, there was a threading bug, but I ran it again and it didn't happen, so it must not be a problem.“ Similarly, you can't just hurl an XSD at the world and expect that everyone will write code to consume the corresponding XML directly off the wire - they're going to use vendor toolkits for the simple economic reason that it's too expensive not to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I'm not putting words into the mouths of any of the participants in this debate. Many of them make the same points, although not, I think, in the same “camp neutral“ vein. My point is that you can claim to be either a “contract-first” or “code-first” person and still succeed. Which pretty much makes the distinction (and therefore that aspect of the debate) pointless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, call yourself whatever you want, but you still get to learn the stack from end-to-end. Programmers hate this because they spend their life building abstractions, and this flies right in the face of that. Vendors hate it to admit it because it means they can't sell toolkits that “take care of everything for you.” (Not that they don't try.) But at the end of the day, the universe doesn't care that we don't like it - it's still the case that abstractions leak, and knowledge is the only insurance. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>15</thr:total></entry><entry><id>7790</id><published>2005-04-27T08:49:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-04-27T08:49:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Contract First?

The real answer it that "It just has to work end-to-end", no matter where you start.  It is impossible to code first at one end without knowing how one tool converts to WSDL  and other tools covert back to code.  While it would appear to be better to start in the middle with the WSDL, but that will likely end in failure without understanding how the WSDL translates back to code on either end.  The approach that I have been generally successful with is to write/modify code on either end until each end generates equivalent WSDL.

&lt;br /&gt;I totally agree with your point. Personally, I'm in the "know your XML, but let the framework do grungy string generation" camp. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;XML to object serialization is the mother of all leaky abstractions - you simply have to know what's going on in there. But if you do, it's a great time saver.

Code First? Both First.</title><content type="html">Generally 'code first' vs 'contract first' is probably best looked as a philosophical, or as you say 'religious' debate.  However, this debate does have real world implications.  In the 'contract first' situation you define the on the wire format and are forced to write code on both sides, *regardless of your choice of tools*, that handle it.  This is harder but you know that if it doesn't work you implemented the contract wrong.  In the 'code first' approach the contract is a reflection of your implementation (and quite possibly what patches you've applied.. what version of ASP.NET you're running etc.) and you have little control going from ASP.NET 1 to ASP.NET 2 what happens to your WSDL automatically (ie changes to make ASP.NET 2.0 generated WSDL ws-i BP 1.1 compliant).  Further, your auto-generated 'contract' doesn't tell you what's required to implement an interface.. rather just what the tool can swallow...  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This might be fine for small numbers of very flexible clients but for providing a stable endpoint that specifies what is needed you need contract first.

Most of them just want you to give them something that works with their toolkit. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn't call this "contract first" because the way that term has been used implies that the wire format is paramount, and toolsets don't matter. This is not in fact true. They matter a lot, because without them most of your clients don't have access to your service.

However, if you are actually implementing the contract correctly, your frustration will not matter to your client.

If you don't, then it's currently easy to write contracts they can't consume. So, yes, you have to put the contract first...but the contract must be constrained by the tools your client will use. This is true whether you author the WSDL in notepad or generate it out of a bunch of Java classes automatically.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Which is why I say, "Both first". At no point did I claim or intend to imply one should "[let] it be simply a reflection of your tools". In fact, the last sentence of the original post points out that vendor claims of abstraction by tool are so much BS. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you want to call this focusing on the contract, that's fine by me. My only point is that to be successful, you must understand the limitations of the tools, and you must understand the details of the contract. Both are equally important if you want to interoperate in the real world.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="7786"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>21177</id><published>2006-04-06T10:40:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-04-06T10:40:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">The Perils of WSDL First</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="7786"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>22066</id><published>2006-04-19T05:59:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-04-19T05:59:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">The Perils of WSDL First (Again)</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="7786"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>8088</id><published>2005-05-07T04:42:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-05-07T04:42:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">When You Wish Upon a Star</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, I was reading &lt;a href="http://www.inkblog.com/CommentView,guid,52363a44-cc22-494d-a4ce-fffddf145b4f.aspx"&gt;David Weller's blog&lt;/a&gt;.

Well, when I got home that day, there was a package from Apress with the book inside.

I was on vacation last week, and it seemed like a good book to read. So I did. And I really liked it. Herewith, my review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I should point out again that this book was sent to me by the publisher, for free, presumably in the hopes that I would give it a favorable review here. I like to think that this doesn't bias me, but I wanted to make sure I pointed this out clearly in the interest of full disclosure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is divided roughly into two parts. The first part deals with general physical concepts, like what happens when two objects collide, and the equations governing projectiles. As a guy with a Masters degree in Electrical Engineering, I know a fair amount about basic physics, and am pretty comfortable with math, but even still I definitely learned a few things. I could have used the bit about how rotating objects collide a few years back when I was writing a DirectX demo. One of the more interesting topics was the aerodynamic effect of spin on projectiles (think curveball).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the book is what you might call “applied game physics”. There are chapters on things like how to model cars, boats, and various sports games, using the principles outlined in the first part of the book. I thought this was a pretty reasonable approach. Although I'm not writing a game that requires this sort of simulation at the moment, if I were I think there would be plenty here for me to make use of. For example, I liked  the presentation of damage models for armored vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as the style of the book goes, I think that's actually where it really shines. The author has a way of explaining things that's thorough without being verbose. He also does a good job of keeping the scope limited to what I could actually fit in my head over the course of a week of relatively relaxed reading. As a result, the book weighs in at a reasonable 400 pages or so. I like that it's not an 800-page monster that tries to address everything under the sun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of places where I might have liked to see a bit more treatment of a particular subject. For instance, the author punts on the topic of three-dimensional collisions of rotating objects. This is a pretty reasonable compromise, particularly in service of keeping the book manageable, but because it's a topic that I've had to address in the past, I found myself somewhat disappointed to find it elided in the text. Still, I have to admit that there's enough material in there that I could likely work it out from what was presented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I should point out is that this is more a book about physics than it is about games. Although the author includes quite a few sample applications, they're hardly the sort of thing that you'd play on a Saturday night: they're more like simple demonstration programs. But again, in the service of simplicity, I see this as a good thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of simplicity, let me mention math. There's a fair amount of it in the book. The integral symbol appears a few times, and differential equations make a frequent appearance. This may challenge some people, but frankly, if you can't handle some math, you can't handle game programming anyway. And I think the author does a pretty good job of explaining the basics, although I may be a poor judge, since I was already familiar with all the mathematical concepts he presented. In any event, there's code that implements most of the equations he presents, which should help most people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final note, the source code presented in the book is in Java. As a C# guy, I found this to be dead easy to read, so I never even bothered to grab the C# translation that's available on the website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, I definitely liked this book. It's a nice length, the style is pleasantly clear, and the material is a pretty good balance of depth and breadth. If you're writing a program where things fly through the air, collide, explode, or fall, this is a handy resource. Like I said before: “Physics. Games. Programming. What's not to love?” &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>8423</id><published>2005-05-17T04:46:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-05-17T04:46:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">When You Wish Upon a Star</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="8420"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>8511</id><published>2005-05-22T11:39:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-05-22T11:39:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Physics for Game Programmers Reviewed</title><content type="html">Great review, I've ordered a copy.

But it is not well written and much of the physics you need for a video game is simply missing
Most of this book is already available for free (and better written) on Wikipedia and other well known game programming websites
To understand RK4 you need to read across multiple sections of multiple chapters - piecing together how it works between long descriptions of the code like "the constructor initialises the variable" and "there are standard getter and setter properties" with little discussion about the important points - the code itself is bizarre - it should be written to highlight HOW it works rather than a failed attempt to show coding best practices
The book is not layed out correctly - for instance code samples break across multiple pages making them hard to read and the fonts used for the math notation and code is horrible to read
The author does not and has not written video games for a living - that is painfully obvious

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be some opinion that the new version of Managed C++ is all that an a bag of Krispy Kremes. This may well be true - I've followed MC++ a bit, and they seem to have done a great job making this latest version a very powerful and elegant language. However, via &lt;a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=1786"&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; I see that at least &lt;a href="http://grumpyoldprogrammer.myblogsite.com/blog/_archives/2005/5/12/834859.html"&gt;some people&lt;/a&gt; think this means C# is dead. With that, I cannot agree. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, technologies don't succeed because they're fast, or elegant, or powerful. If they did, Windows never would have made it to 2005. (Note, I'm not saying that it sucks. Just that it used to.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, technologies succeed for a whole bunch of reasons that have to do with psychology, not engineering. For example, did you program in C++ for three months one time without a debugger at a job you hated? If so, you'll probably have thoughts like, “I'll never program in C++ again as long as I live.” Even C++ had suddenly turned into something that looked exactly like C#. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact of the matter is, people really &lt;strong&gt;like&lt;/strong&gt; C#, and - as far as I can see - are rarely unable to do what they want to with the language. The libraries come up short much more often than the language, but that's to be expected, as the sorts of things we want to do move higher and higher up the abstraction stack. And people generally see C++ as &lt;strong&gt;hard&lt;/strong&gt;, truthfully or not. So my guess is that C++ may have gotten a whole lot better, but it probably isn't about to get a whole lot more popular. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the new features that C++ is sprouting really were able to determine whether it would displace C#, we'd all already be programming in LISP. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>12</thr:total></entry><entry><id>8578</id><published>2005-05-25T14:40:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-05-25T14:40:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: The Reports Its Resurrection May Be Greatly Exaggerated</title><content type="html">C++/CLI may or may not gain mindshare.

If anything C++/CLI looks even more "like a comic-book character swearing" (Paul Graham) than regular C++. In terms of elegance C# wins hands-down.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;However, I think a bigger problem for C++/CLI will be the lack of a target audience. C++ is popular for programming "to the metal", creating the smallest and fastest programs possible. By definition this excludes .NET. On the other hand, if you don't mind the .NET overhead why not just use the simpler and prettier C# language?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;That seems to restrict the appeal of C++/CLI to those few tasks where you have to interface managed and native code. So I agree with your conclusion that C++ won't see a resurrection, though I think people are more rational about this matter than you seem to imply.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="8577"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>8587</id><published>2005-05-26T03:17:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-05-26T03:17:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: The Reports of Its Resurrection May Be Greatly Exaggerated</title><content type="html">Sean: That syntax is a *lot* better than MC++, and so close to C# that I can already read it quite easily. And to Chris's point, it's obviously not more elegant for the types of tasks that C# is already good at (although things like -&amp;gt; versus . is no big deal to me). But when you get into the realm of interop, then as you say, C++ has a more natural syntax for expressing powerful constructs. So it's either more or less elegant depending on the task. But either way, my point stands. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As for whether people choose languages for rational reasons - then why didn't we all switch to Java from C++ when it came out?

Of course there are also those propagandists who simply claim it's all untrue and those awkward Java GUIs are just great. :)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As for Lisp, similar problems: reputation for slowness, lack of libraries for virtually anything but text I/O. Additionally, you have the off-putting ((())) syntax, lack of infix operators (except with brittle hacks), an intolerably verbose OOP system, and a similar problem as with Eiffel: the choice of implementations is limited to either half-baked freeware or very expensive products by small companies (high initial investment, questionable support perspective).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Personally I think you very much overrate expressive power as a rational reason for choosing a language. Virtually nobody really *needs* all the power of C++ or Lisp, certainly not badly enough to sacrifice ease-of-use (relative to the desired application area). In my opinion, the decision to choose ease-of-use is not irrational; the decision to choose unneeded complexity is.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="8577"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>8634</id><published>2005-05-27T04:06:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-05-27T04:06:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: The Reports of Its Resurrection May Be Greatly Exaggerated</title><content type="html">Actually, I was pointing out that for *non-GUI* Java tasks, Java was acceptable years ago. On the GUI side, I won't argue with you. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As for LISP: "reputation" for slowness? :) Well, that one sort of supports my argument about choices being non-rational. Especially when you think about how most people approach optimization.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Libraries, granted. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Syntax is in the eye of the beholder (e.g. XML is great, but LISP sucks?) 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;On the "lack of support" side, again, granted, although that one is a bit less of a factor, IMO. Not because libraries aren't important (they so are), but because all it would take would be a big vendor deciding to do it. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But by now I'm not sure that we're disagreeing at all. Neither of us thinks that the new C++ means C# is dead, because we both think that there are reasons beyond raw power to choose a language. The ones you give are rational reasons not to pick C++, and for the most part I agree with them. I simply assert that there are nonrational reasons as well. If I seemed to imply that people chose language *solely* on the basis of nonrational factors, then I misstated myself - that is not my belief.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="8577"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>9651</id><published>2005-05-31T06:28:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-05-31T06:28:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: The Reports of Its Resurrection May Be Greatly Exaggerated</title><content type="html">I need to use a platform such as .NET or J2EE for software integration via Web services and other middleware.

Of course, I'm still cranking on getting basic functionality in place, so it'll be a long time before some of these ideas get realized, but it's still fun. One of the ideas that I thought about this morning was how to add macro support to the app, so people could add a little automation if they wanted to. Having been exposed a bit to Javascript lately, I've decided that it is an excellent language, with a great balance between power and ease of use...so it seems like a good choice for a scripting language to use from within FlexWikiPad. On thinking about it a little more, I decided that an even better choice is JScript.NET, which combines the niceties of the Javascript language with the power of the .NET libraries. Sweet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set out this morning to see if I could figure out what it would take to weld JScript.NET into a Windows Forms application. As it turned out, it was so easy to do, I didn't even need to look on the Internet to find one of the dozens of other implementations of this that must already exist. And it's too cool not to share. So here's the code: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#008000"&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;using&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt; System.CodeDom.Compiler; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;using&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt; System.Reflection; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;using&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt; Microsoft.JScript; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Create the compiler object&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;JScriptCodeProvider provider = &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;new&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; JScriptCodeProvider(); &lt;br /&gt;ICodeCompiler compiler = provider.CreateCompiler(); &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CompilerParameters options = &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;new&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; CompilerParameters();&lt;br /&gt;options.GenerateInMemory = &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;true&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#008000"&gt;// Generating an "executable" just means that the code will have an entry point, rather than simply &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#008000"&gt;// being a collection of classes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;options.GenerateExecutable = &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;true&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#008000"&gt;// Adding references is optional - mscorlib and Microsoft.JScript are automatically referenced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;options.ReferencedAssemblies.Add("System.Windows.Forms"); &lt;br /&gt;CompilerResults results = compiler.CompileAssemblyFromSource(options, textBox1.Text); &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#008000"&gt;// Run the newly generated assembly's Main method&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Assembly assembly = results.CompiledAssembly; &lt;br /&gt;MethodInfo entryPoint = assembly.EntryPoint; &lt;br /&gt;entryPoint.Invoke(&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;null&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;, &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;new&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;object&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;[] { &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;null&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; } ); &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it. The code above is the handler for a button I put on a form. The only other thing on the form is a multiline text box that holds the code I want to compile. In my case, I typed in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;import System.Windows.Forms;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;MessageBox.Show(”Hello world”);&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as a simple test, but I could have used any valid JScript.NET program. Note that one of the benefits of JScript.NET is that it doesn't require me to explicitly create a Main method - anything at global scope will automatically be stuffed into one for me automatically. This sort of brevity is a real feature in a macro language, in my opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as how to use this to achieve automation, that's the easy part: the way I've written this, the JScript.NET code will run in the same AppDomain as the application code that's calling it. So they can both easily access static members of any types they can both access. One way to handle this is to add this line of code&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;options.ReferencedAssemblies.Add(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just before you call CompileAssemblyFromSource. That will make the generated assembly depend on the EXE that's calling it, allowing it to use any types that are defined within the exe. So for instance, a class like this in the application&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;class&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; Context {&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;private&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;static&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; Context _context; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;private&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;string&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; _data; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;static&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; Context Current {&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;get &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;      &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;if&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; (_context == &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;null&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;) {&lt;br /&gt;        _context = &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;new&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; Context();&lt;br /&gt;      &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;      &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;return&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; _context; &lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;public&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;string&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; Data {&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;get&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; { &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;return&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; _data; }&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;set&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; { _data = &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;value&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;; }&lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would let me write macro code that looks like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;Context.Current.Name = "Craig";&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and after the macro ran, I could retrieve the value “Craig” from within the EXE by simply reading Context.Current.Name. Or I could do the reverse, and set values in Context.Current before invoking the macro, and it would be able to read them. The possibilities are endless. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>16</thr:total></entry><entry><id>8637</id><published>2005-05-27T06:11:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-05-27T06:11:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Adding JScript.NET Macro Support to Your Application</title><content type="html">Just have to say:

I'm having a lot of fun with it. However I'm having two problems:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;1. Each time I enter code into the textbox and run it the main executable's memory usage goes up. I think each click of my "Run Script" button is calling into memory a new assembly that stays there. Do you know how to unload an assembly after it has executed?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;2. How do I access the main form's properties and methods in a way better than:
&lt;br /&gt;Application.OpenForms[0].Text = "(something)";
&lt;br /&gt;

You're almost certainly correct. And in .NET 1.1, there is no way to unload an assembly. In .NET 2.0, there might be, but I don't know what it is. If I get a free minute, I'll try to look it up. Otherwise, you can always cause the load to happen in a different AppDomain, and shut down the AppDomain when you're done. 
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I originally tried using the Context Class method and it failed... because I didn't "import" the EXE namespace in the macro. It works now!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;import System
&lt;br /&gt;import System.Windows.Forms
&lt;br /&gt;import JScriptTestBed

I had some trouble running your sample, which I copy-pasted, just because of a stupid detail : double-quotes around “Hello World” are nice english typographic double quotes (“, ”), while JScript expects normal ugly straight double quotes (").

Anyway, it gave me an opportunity to iterate through the error collection, which was a great experience.

It's a batch file that will let you run JScript.NET files interactively. Since Javascript is a compiled language, it does this by compiling it to a temporary directory first and then running the compiled EXE. While this might sound slow, as it turns out it's quite acceptable for quick, scripting-type tasks, and it gives me what I've always wanted: a convenient scripting language with full, natural-sytnax access both to COM and the .NET libraries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much as I'd like to claim credit for the batch file, I can't. It was written by John Elliott (for whom I don't have a URL) and posted to the &lt;a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/"&gt;WinTech Off-Topic List&lt;/a&gt;. The only modification I made was to add the /fast- switch to the compile, which turns off “fast mode”. Near as I can tell (not yet being that familiar with JScript.NET), it makes the code somewhat slower, but enables a lot of the more “scripty” features of the language, such as the ability to add methods dynamically to BCL types. Anyway, here's the script. I called mine rjs.cmd, and stuck it in my \bin directory, which is in my path. Then I can launch scripts by simply running “rjs foo.js“. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;PerformanceCounter answer = new PerformanceCounter(s_PerformanceCounterCategoryName, name, false);&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is sometimes taking a &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; long time to come back. Like several minutes. I started tracking it down via Reflector and native debugging, and it looks as though PerformanceCounter internally spins in this loop, inside a BCL-internal class called SharedPerformanceCounter: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;int num1 = SharedPerformanceCounter.MaxSpinCount;&lt;br /&gt;while (spinLockPointer[0] != 0)&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;  Thread.Sleep(1);&lt;br /&gt;  num1--;&lt;br /&gt;  if (num1 == 0)&lt;br /&gt;  {&lt;br /&gt;    spinLockPointer[0] = 0;&lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the fact that this looks thread-unsafe to me, I'm not entirely sure what it's waiting for at this point. But given that MaxSpinCount is 10000, on my machine that seems to work out to around four minutes, so that explains where the delay is coming from. But what I don't understand is under what conditions this occurs - the SharedPerformanceCounter code is a bit hard to wade through, and I haven't made much headway with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an RTFM moment, &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/savanness/"&gt;Shawn Van Ness&lt;/a&gt; suggested I look over at the &lt;a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/productfeedback/"&gt;Product Feedback Center&lt;/a&gt; to see if there were any similar bugs. I'd Googled, but hadn't landed there, although I should have thought of it. At any rate, when I &lt;strong&gt;did&lt;/strong&gt; look I found &lt;a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/productfeedback/viewfeedback.aspx?feedbackid=0540ddfe-5787-4bf3-bf71-d8d291694dca"&gt;this rather disturbing bug&lt;/a&gt;. Why disturbing? Because it implies that slowness in PerformanceCounter is to be expected. Although one could also read the bug report to merely indicate that the service hanging because of a long-running operation is the expected behavior. Either way, not very helpful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I haven't been able to figure anything out on this, so I'm blogging it. Ideally someone will know what I'm doing wrong. As a second best, perhaps the entry will serve as a sanity check for others with the same problem. Has anyone seen this constructor take a really, really long time to come back before? &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>10</thr:total></entry><entry><id>11598</id><published>2005-06-21T09:55:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-06-21T09:55:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: PerformanceCounter Constructor Horribly Slow</title><content type="html">is this the cause of the mysterious slowdowns  saw a few moths ago?</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="11596"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>11607</id><published>2005-06-21T12:30:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-06-21T12:30:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: PerformanceCounter Constructor Horribly Slow</title><content type="html">Possibly.

PerformanceCounters use a machine wide memory mapped file to publish perf counter data.  That file contains an object graph and various places we use as spinlocks.  
&lt;br /&gt;The problem comes in when processes get killed unexpectedly.  A process which dies while holding a spinlock won't release it, meaning the next process gets blocked.  After spinning 10000 times, we assume some process died and continue on, so we won't block forever - 4 minutes on your machine.  My guess is that IIS is terminating your app when it resets it.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In Whidbey we've fixed these problems.  If you're interested, I can post a blog entry with more details.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;&lt;em&gt; I can shed some light on these issues. PerformanceCounters use a machine wide memory mapped file to publish perf counter data. That file contains an object graph and various places we use as spinlocks. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I know basically nothing about Java, but I'm usually pretty good about picking things up quickly, so I dove in. I don't think I have anything particularly technical to add to the body of knowledge, but I thought I'd relate my experience as a complete Java n00b in the web services space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial involvement in the effort happened after the client's attempts to get &lt;a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/"&gt;Axis&lt;/a&gt; working failed. This was probably due to the fact that Axis seems to be primarily a server-side technology, and they need to get it working from within an applet running in a browser (they're providing a rich UI for a complicated part of an ASP.NET web application). I imagine we could have gotten Axis to work had we banged on it for long enough, but this part of the project was rapidly becoming the biggest schedule risk. So I went and asked some of my smart Java friends what they recommended as an alternative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them suggested &lt;a href="http://xfire.codehaus.org/"&gt;XFire&lt;/a&gt;. It seemed like a reasonable alternative, but my client was unable to get it working either, even after a few days of hacking on it. Meetings were called, and more and more senior managers were called in. This is where I took an active hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not knowing anything about Java or Java web service toolkits, I figured that given all the knobs and buttons we were having trouble figuring out, the most predictable route was one that eschewed web service toolkits entirely. So I asked some smart friends again, and got pointed to &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxb/"&gt;JAXB&lt;/a&gt;, which is Sun's equivalent of XmlSerializer. Once I located xjc.bat, I was able to generate some simple classes and to serialize/deserialze them to/from XML within a few hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, I felt a lot better. The code to do low-level HTTP in Java is pretty straightforward, and with the JAXB-generated classes, I knew we'd be able to do what we needed to do. But since I was now slightly ahead of the three days I told my client it would take me to figure out the problem, I decided to spend a little time working with &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/saaj/index.jsp"&gt;SAAJ&lt;/a&gt;, which is the next layer in Sun's web service stack. It abstracts away the HTTP part of doing XML web services. I figured it was worth a little time to experiment, as it was likely a higher-quality version of the code I was going to wind up writing myself anyway. As it turned out, it was also pretty easy to figure out, and after a few more hours I was able to use my JAXB classes together with the SAAJ stuff to call a simple .NET web service successfully. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last part of the infrastructure I wrote by hand. It was a fairly simple XSLT that would walk a WSDL document and generate a Java proxy class that would make the SAAJ calls I'd figured out. That took me another few hours. All told I had something workable in around a day and a half. It's not the world's most robust thing right now, but it unblocked the guy who's writing the applet, and that's a Very Good Thing. As we move forward, I'm sure we'll need to add things like better SOAP fault handling, but I don't think that's going to be too terribly difficult either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line of all this is that - in the Java world - it appears to have been much easier for me to get up and running with low-level, XML-oriented APIs in Java than with a big OO-oriented toolkit (&lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/tewald/"&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt; would be proud). I am, of course, no expert in Java, and the real test will come as we try to use the code I generated in a production application, but I found the experience quite interesting. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>12782</id><published>2005-06-30T22:01:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-06-30T22:01:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Take a Walk on the Wild Side</title><content type="html">Cool :)

&lt;br /&gt;Once in a while its good to take a step into the unknown.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In my team (C# developers) theres an ongoing discussion about java vs .net. The young guys who never did anything other that .Net swears theres nothing out there that can ever compete. Some of the more experienced programmers who came from the java world, keeps saying "In Java this woul be soooo easy", and then finaly theres me. I say the language is just a tool, and it should be used as such.

At the time, I didn't really appreciate how truly powerful LISP is, but in the intervening years, as I've seen languages like C# and Java grow up, I've made or heard the comment “Yeah, LISP already has that” enough times to make me consider trying to program exclusively in LISP for a while. As was the case with my self-imposed switch to Test Driven Development, forcing myself to use a new technology is guaranteed to be a great way to learn something. The kicker, of course, is that I'd &lt;strong&gt;really &lt;/strong&gt;miss the .NET libraries - at this stage of my career writing your own file IO routines is only fun for about ten minutes, and learning new ones is only slightly more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that that's going to stop me from learning &lt;a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. You've probably heard the buzz around it lately - I certainly have. Buzz I can generally ignore, but when smart people like &lt;a href="http://agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy/"&gt;Brad&lt;/a&gt; get excited about something, I generally try to get around to looking into it sooner or later. Particularly when &lt;a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntegratingRubyAndWatirWithNUnit.aspx"&gt;Scott raves about Watir&lt;/a&gt;, and I need something that looks a lot like that for several projects I'm working on. So yesterday I started to work through &lt;a href="http://www.math.umd.edu/~dcarrera/ruby/0.3/"&gt;a pretty good Ruby tutorial&lt;/a&gt; on my way to playing with Watir, and I thought to myself, “Man, this looks a lot like LISP's child by a shell script mother.” Not the syntax - there Ruby and LISP are pretty different - but in a qualitative way that I have a hard time pinning down...they just “feel“ similar in how they deal with programming abstractions at a high level. I don't know: it's hard for me to express given how little Ruby I've done and how little LISP I've done lately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this morning I'm flipping through my aggregator entries, and I see &lt;a href="http://rover.cs.northwestern.edu/~surana/blog/past/000254.html"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; from Pinku Surana about how it would be relatively easy for someone to knock out a LISP.NET implementation. Combine this with the fact that I'm basically between gigs right now, and I think the planets are aligning - it seems I'm being directed to learn a higher-level language. I just need some flaming letters on the mountainside to be sure. :) &lt;/p&gt;

Generally, I've been more happy there, particularly because I far prefer CVS to the crazy contraption GDN has, but not all is rosy. To start with, I find that during the middle of the day, SF has lately been slow to the point of unusability. This is particularly painful when I'm trying to use the bug and feature tracking pages, which require several clicks to get what I'm looking for. Each click can take as long as 30 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times I've thought that maybe I should just set up my own bug database. But then I'd have to evaluate the options, pick one, and then maintain it. Bleh. Still, it might be better than having to wait half a minute for each page to come back. Then, the other day, I stumbled across &lt;a href="http://www.advogato.org/article/357.html#3"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, a feature of SF that lets you get the entire contents of a tracker in “XML” form. (More about the quotes in a second.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brilliant! With this, I figured I could suck the bug and feature databases onto my machine, then use Excel or InfoPath (if I ever figure out InfoPath) or whatever to browse the database quickly. I can't do updates, but often times all I want to do is read through a bug description or do a quick search, and a local export is perfect for that. So I sat down to automate download, got done with that in a few seconds (gotta love wget), and then went to load up the &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; bug database in Excel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XML Parse Error. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTF? I ran it through one of the XML utilities I wrote, and found out that there was an unescaped “smart quote” in the text. Disturbing that it wound up in the export, but oh well - three seconds with “find and replace” fixed that. Fire it up in Excel again and...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XML Parse Error. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, now what? Well, it turns out that the smart quote issue was just the tip of the iceberg. Here's an exerpt from the exported file that shows the problem in all its glaring obviousness: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&amp;lt;detail&amp;gt;Produces this output (first &amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt; not needed, second &lt;br /&gt;opening of &amp;lt;ol&amp;gt; not needed).  If that was fixed then the &lt;br /&gt;incorrect double &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; should also be fixed (single &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;) &lt;br /&gt;as they would be no longer necessary. BTW:  also seen &lt;br /&gt;here the unnecessary blank lines&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&amp;lt;/detail&amp;gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the &lt;em&gt;numerous &lt;/em&gt;problems with this. Here it's unescaped HTML tags being produced verbatim, but unescaped &amp;amp; and &amp;lt; characters (not to mention the smart quotes) litter the export. This is a classic sign of XML being built via string concatenation, and it renders this export virtually useless for consumption - all the dangling close and open tags completely destroy the ability of any reasonable XML parser to work with this document.

&lt;p&gt;Sigh. It's a fairly simple fix to process the document with custom code to escape the “XML” well enough to be able to work with it, but I shouldn't have to. The moral of the story here is that if you find yourself doing something like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;xml = “&amp;lt;foo&amp;gt;” + fooContents + “&amp;lt;/foo&amp;gt;”; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;The fact that the example given above is embedding HTML content within an element and the developer (or more precise the development team) has not done enough testing to validate the generated xml is more of an issue IMHO.

Specifically, they aren't escaping illegal characters in the generated XML. Very bad, particularly because it renders the output useless to conforming XML parsers like the ones in System.Xml. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The problem is, during business hours the trackers on SourceForge are so slow as to be nearly useless. I assume this is because they're overloaded. Whatever the reason, if all you want to do is scan through all the open bugs in &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt;, it's annoying: I'm not going to update anything, after all, and looking through 200 bugs when page loads take in excess of 30 seconds &lt;strong&gt;each &lt;/strong&gt;is not an option. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So I set out to see what I could hack together quickly to fix the SourceForge export. And what I came up with is &lt;em&gt;tracker-tidy&lt;/em&gt;. The source is at the bottom of this post. It's an ugly little program that does one thing: escapes &amp;amp; and &amp;lt; within a particular XML tag. It does this by scanning a text file one line at a time, looking for &amp;lt;foo&amp;gt;, where "foo" is whatever you specify on the command line. When it finds it, it replaces all occurrences of &amp;amp; and &amp;lt; with &amp;amp;amp; and &amp;amp;lt; (respectively) between that point and where it finds &amp;lt;/foo&amp;gt;. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Like I said, it's ugly. It doesn't deal with attributes on the opening tag, it doesn't know jack about XML namespaces, and it doesn't replace the contents of more than one tag at a time (although it will do all tags with that name). Doing all that would have required a lot more than 70 lines of code. But what I have works against the SourceForge feed, although I have to run it several times, once for each tag that might have illegal content. I use &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html"&gt;wget&lt;/a&gt; and tracker-tidy together in this batch file: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #d7e1d9"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;wget &lt;/font&gt;&lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/export/sf_tracker_export.php?group_id=113273^&amp;amp;atid=665396"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;http://sourceforge.net/export/sf_tracker_export.php?group_id=113273^&amp;amp;atid=665396&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt; -O bugs.xml&lt;br /&gt;copy /y bugs.xml input.xml&lt;br /&gt;tracker-tidy summary input.xml &amp;gt; intermediate.xml&lt;br /&gt;copy /y intermediate.xml input.xml&lt;br /&gt;tracker-tidy detail input.xml &amp;gt; intermediate.xml&lt;br /&gt;copy /y intermediate.xml input.xml&lt;br /&gt;tracker-tidy old_value input.xml &amp;gt; intermediate.xml&lt;br /&gt;copy /y intermediate.xml input.xml&lt;br /&gt;tracker-tidy text input.xml &amp;gt; intermediate.xml&lt;br /&gt;copy /y intermediate.xml bugs-tidied.xml&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #d7e1d9"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #d7e1d9"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;wget &lt;/font&gt;&lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/export/sf_tracker_export.php?group_id=113273^&amp;amp;atid=665399"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;http://sourceforge.net/export/sf_tracker_export.php?group_id=113273^&amp;amp;atid=665399&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt; -O rfe.xml&lt;br /&gt;copy /y rfe.xml input.xml&lt;br /&gt;tracker-tidy summary input.xml &amp;gt; intermediate.xml&lt;br /&gt;copy /y intermediate.xml input.xml&lt;br /&gt;tracker-tidy detail input.xml &amp;gt; intermediate.xml&lt;br /&gt;copy /y intermediate.xml input.xml&lt;br /&gt;tracker-tidy old_value input.xml &amp;gt; intermediate.xml&lt;br /&gt;copy /y intermediate.xml input.xml&lt;br /&gt;tracker-tidy text input.xml &amp;gt; intermediate.xml&lt;br /&gt;copy /y intermediate.xml rfe-tidied.xml&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #d7e1d9"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #d7e1d9"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;del bugs.xml&lt;br /&gt;del rfe.xml&lt;br /&gt;del input.xml&lt;br /&gt;del intermediate.xml&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This simply downloads the tracker bug and feature request exports for &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; and tidies up the output with multiple passes of tracker-tidy (one for each problem tag in the export). &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Once I have the tidied files bugs-tidied and rfe-tidied, it's a simple matter to open them up in Excel or InfoPath, or whatever your favorite XML-based tool is. From there, sorting and searching is dead easy. If I get really ambitious, one of these days I'll write an XSL to generate a nice little web report instead. But given how little effort went into getting something that works as well as this does, I sort of doubt it. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Anyway, hopefully this will help someone else. Obviously, you'll need to replace the URLs in the batch file with the group_id and atid for your project, but other than that it should work fine. Just remember to escape any &amp;amp; signs in the URL with ^, the command-line escape character.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #d7e1d9"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;using System; &lt;br /&gt;using System.IO; &lt;br /&gt;using System.Text; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Keith just &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/archive/2005/08/23/14293.aspx"&gt;outed&lt;/a&gt; me, so I'd better come clean. :)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I've been an independent contractor for about the last six years. I love it. One of the great things about it is the flexibility: my schedule is flexible, my working arrangements are flexible, and indeed my very career track is flexible. Of course, all that flexibility comes with a price - I have to self-direct, and sometimes you wind up on the bench for a bit. But I don't mind those. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One of the very positive outcomes of all this flexibility has been the ability to alternate between what I think of as an "academic" track, and what I think of as a "practical" track. In my "academic" mode, I spend a lot of time sitting around and looking through docs, playing with betas, and generally examining all the corners of a particular piece of technology. In my "practical" mode, I help my clients build real systems. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I can't imagine doing just one or the other. If I were purely academic, then there are all sorts of things that I'd never be forced to do, like write a real build script, fix really difficult bugs, or, generally, ship a product. And if I were purely practical, then I'd almost always be constrained by time pressure to only learn the parts of technology that I actually use, as they became needed. That sort of need-driven education tends to leave big holes in your knowledge, and you never know when the stuff you don't know might come in handy. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Teaching for DevelopMentor was a great way to live the academic life. The fear induced by the thought of standing in front of an audience and not knowing what the hell you're talking about is an excellent motivator. I learned tons of things I never would have, simply because I wanted to know the answer in case anyone ever asked me. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left" style="DIRECTION: ltr"&gt;At the same time, not being forced to apply all that theoretical knowledge means that you can't fully appreciate it. You can think all you want about things like the performance of the .NET garbage collector, but there's no substitute for experience to tell you that in the real world you hardly ever care about it. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left" style="DIRECTION: ltr"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left" style="DIRECTION: ltr"&gt;For roughly the last three years, I've been in a almost purely practical mode, and it's been great. I've worked on a bunch of open source projects (most notably &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt;), contributed to the &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/"&gt;MSDN2&lt;/a&gt; rewrite, and helped my client &lt;a href="http://www.integic.com"&gt;Integic&lt;/a&gt; with a massive .NET port of their workflow product. It has all been highly educational. But the pendulum has swung, and now I miss the academic side of things, particularly now that we're so close to the release of the next version of .NET. So I'm making a change. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'm proud to announce that I will once again be taking on the role of itinerant instructor, this time with &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/"&gt;Pluralsight&lt;/a&gt;. It's a first-rate organization, and I'm really looking forward to working with these guys again. I'm not entirely sure what class(es) I'll be teaching yet, but I'm definitely eager to get to it - diving deep into the details of something and then sharing it with my students. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The timing on this is pretty good. I'm ramping down with my existing client as their ship date approaches, so it's a good time to change gears. Which is where you (and the subtitle of this post) come in: I'm also looking for work. I'll be teaching, of course, but that's only a fraction of my time, and as I explained, I don't think I can be the best instructor I can be unless I'm continually applying the knowledge I've gained in the real world.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Here's the part where I shamelessly promote myself (you can skip to the last paragraph if you find this sort of thing embarrassing):&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I graduated with a simultaneous BS/MS in 1995 from MIT. I've got about five years experience working with .NET. I consider my specialty to be the design and implementation of &lt;a href="http://wangdera.com/resumes/CraigAndera.htm"&gt;large-scale distributed systems&lt;/a&gt;. I'm quite good with C#. I know my way around XML, including web services technologies and XSLT. I've written for &lt;a href="http://msdn.com/msdnmag"&gt;MSDN Magazine&lt;/a&gt;. I'm a mean debugger. I learn very quickly. I helped rewrite a significant chunk of &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/"&gt;the fourth biggest website on the planet&lt;/a&gt;. I've spoken at conferences around the world on topics from Visual Studio to Direct3D. You can find my resume &lt;a href="http://wangdera.com/people.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So, if you've got a project you think I could help with, please do &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/contact.aspx"&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;. And if not, hopefully I'll see you in class! &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Like I said, I love being an independent contractor; it makes for interesting transitions.

&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'm an HTML/CSS neophyte. I can manage a basic page okay, but fancy-pants layout is well beyond me. CSS, in particular, is a topic whose further reaches I've never explored. Heck, I've barely wandered a few feet from its parking lot. (Although the FireFox &lt;a href="http://editcss.mozdev.org/"&gt;EditCSS extension&lt;/a&gt; has made my HTML look &lt;strong&gt;loads&lt;/strong&gt; better by making it easy to experiment.)  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One of the things I always have trouble with is figuring out how to center stuff. I'll slap a &lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;text-align: center&lt;/font&gt; on things sometimes, but that doesn't always accomplish what I want. So today I ran across this little nugget: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;.centered80&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;{&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;  position: absolute;&lt;br /&gt;  left: 10%;&lt;br /&gt;  right: 10%&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It gives me the ability to center something in the middle 80% of the page. It worked so well I wanted to record it here for my own future reference. I'm sure anyone that has spent any time with CSS already knows this (or a better version), but at least now I can find it again when I need it. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>18</thr:total></entry><entry><id>14314</id><published>2005-08-24T05:35:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-08-24T05:35:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Typing Accents</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="14311"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>14315</id><published>2005-08-24T05:54:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-08-24T05:54:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Centering with CSS</title><content type="html">Also a CSS neophyte, so take with a grain of salt, but doesn't it depend on the properties of the container (absolute, relative, flow, etc. -- a model that has never quite clicked with me)?</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="14311"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>14316</id><published>2005-08-24T06:14:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-08-24T06:14:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Centering with CSS</title><content type="html">I have no idea! :)

&lt;br /&gt;All I know is, it worked this time on a whole-page div I was using.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="14311"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>14321</id><published>2005-08-24T08:57:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-08-24T08:57:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Re: Centering with CSS</title><content type="html">that position:absolute; could come back to haunt you if you use it elsewhere.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Typically, you'd use this technique.  Suppose a page with a main div (mainDiv) that you want to center...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;body { text-align: center;}
&lt;br /&gt;#mainDiv {margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; text-align: left;}
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The reason you have to add the text-align: left; is due to a flaw in IE.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;You can also do this approach with a div within a div or a table within a div.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;div.centered {text-align: center;}
&lt;br /&gt;div.centered table {margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: left;}

&lt;br /&gt;#mainDiv {margin: 0 auto; width: 600px;}
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Set the width to whatever you want. The margin property is specified as top right bottom left (like a clock). If you only supply two values (top right) then the value for top is also the value for bottom and value for right is also value for left. Thus the rule above sets top and bottom margins to zero and auto margins left and right which has the effect of centering the div.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="14311"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>14333</id><published>2005-08-24T14:06:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-08-24T14:06:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Centering with CSS</title><content type="html">Phil - that's good to know.

&lt;br /&gt;To center your page in the middle 80% of the browser:
&lt;br /&gt;BODY {width:100%;}
&lt;br /&gt;#mainDiv {margin:0 auto;width:80%;}

Think of it this way: pretend you have three divs one after the other. Normally they appear stacked. It may help to think of them as three cheerleaders stacked one on top of the other. Now take the middle cheerleader and pull her out of the stack and place her standing up 3 feet in front of the other girls (now only a stack of two). You have just absolutely positioned her but it affected the size/layout of the "stack". Note that I'm taking a lot of artistic license in this explanation of the box model, but absolute positioning breaks the element out of the normal flow and removes the space previously taken up by that element. Relative positioning, by way of contrast, is like breaking her out of the stack but putting an invisible box in her place for the top cheerleader to stand on. That is, it moves the element relative from its starting position but doesn't collapse the space taken up by the element. The rest of the surrounding layout behaves as if the element were still in its original location.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="14311"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>14349</id><published>2005-08-25T06:29:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-08-25T06:29:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Centering with CSS</title><content type="html">Right, that makes a lot of sense.

&lt;br /&gt;In this case, if it's a single, top-level element that I'm centering, it would seem that I'm avoiding this specific issue.

I want to center a div (containing a layout graphic) in the middle of the screen and then center a div (containing text) ON TOP of it and a bit farther DOWN the page, so that it looks like an IFRAME layout. I want to use divs instead of iframes. As you already know, when &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;overflow:auto&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; is applied to the div containing the text, it will scroll like an iframe does when the content is longer than the space provided. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I used &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;margin-left:auto&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;margin-right: auto&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; on both divs to center them in the screen. I also used the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;z-index&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; property, so one div would be on top of the other.  I got it to work perfectly in Firefox and it looked GREAT, but when I tried to view the same page in IE, the content div was underneath the layout div and not centered.  Arrrrggghhhhhh!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I don't want to use absolute positioning, because if the browser window is resized, or if the viewer is using a different resolution, the divs wont be centered.  What can I do?

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;You give the body tag an id name and set it to position:absolute and the width and height to 100%;
&lt;br /&gt;Then you put whatever you want centered in a div tag and give that an id. Set it to position:absolute. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Using the prototype getHeight and getWidth functions on your "body" id will return the width and height of the users screen no matter the size or resolution. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Subtract the width and height (using the prototype functions if necessary) on the inner div and then subtract that number by 2. What you are left with is a number that represents half of the remaining distance leftover  after the inner div is on the screen. set the left and top of the inner div to those numbers and 'tada'

&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I was working on reformatting &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/08/24/14311.aspx"&gt;my résumé&lt;/a&gt; a little bit today, and I wanted to change my MSN IM tag to reflect the fact. So I set it to "Resume" and went off to work. Of course, all that did was draw a smartass remark from &lt;a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/"&gt;Ian&lt;/a&gt; about me powering my brain back up after suspending it. :)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;While we were chatting, I finally remembered the key sequence that would have let me type "résumé" instead of "resume". It's &lt;em&gt;control-'&lt;/em&gt; followed by &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;. Similarly, &lt;em&gt;control-`&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;followed by a letter renders the other accent (although not for all letters). And &lt;em&gt;control-~ a&lt;/em&gt; gives ã. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Two interesting things about this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol type="1" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ian's keyboard gave reversed accents from mine for the same key sequences. But he's in the UK - maybe this has something to do with driving on the wrong side of the road. :) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These key sequences don't work in all text controls. So far, from what I've tested, it works in Word and in MSN IM, but not in notepad, notepad2, nor InfoPath. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;At any rate, I'm sure I could have found this on Google, but now I know where to look. Also, hopefully blogging this will remind me to make sure I put support for it into &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig/TextEditor.html"&gt;my TextEditor control&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>14317</id><published>2005-08-24T07:22:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-08-24T07:22:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Typing Accents</title><content type="html">Neat.

&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;When my daughter Ellen was about 6 months old, my sister Kristin came to visit. Ellen was very shy at that point, and often wouldn't let Kristin hold her, especially if my wife was anywhere within earshot or eyesight. That week, Kristin got stung by a wasp at a barbeque we were having, and was obviously in pain. I was holding Ellen and trying to help Kristin. Ellen reached out her hand and touched Kristin, for all the world looking like she was trying to make Kristin feel better.

Fortunately, she has access to a fast Internet connection and a webcam, so I've gotten to see my girls most days. That's particularly nice when your kid is at the age where she's learning new things pretty much every day. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We've been using MSN Instant Messenger for our video conversations, and all in all I've been pretty pleased. It works well enough. My only complaint is the fairly high audio latency - that can lead to awkward conversational collisions. We've gotten pretty good at not stepping on each other, but I thought maybe I'd try a separate VOIP application, hoping that they were doing something with QoS that would get the latency down. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;My first stop was Skype - I don't know much about VOIP applications, they're free, and they're a big enough name that I felt reasonably okay about installing it. Unfortunately, it completely failed to work - we'd get connected, but then something would happen on Alice's parents' computer and her connection would drop. Oh well - we just went back to the high-latency voice of MSN. She'll be back before we have a chance to try anything else out. Maybe when I start traveling to teach we can explore other options. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left" style="DIRECTION: ltr"&gt;Well, that would have been the last I thought of it, but a few days later, as I was doing some &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; work, I had some IIS problems. Specifically, I was unable to start my website. Oddly, I could still browse to the URLs I was working on, but all I got back was an empty document. By this point, you've probably figured out what I hadn't: another application was listening on port 80, preventing my website from starting, and serving up bogus documents in response to my requests. Obvious to most perhaps, but I had to google &lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;890015"&gt;this KB article&lt;/a&gt; before I figured it out. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left" style="DIRECTION: ltr"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left" style="DIRECTION: ltr"&gt;One "netstat -ano" later, and I'd discovered it was Skype that was hogging the ports. Sure enough, there was a checkbox in the options labeled "use ports 80 and 443 as alternatives". Unchecking it (and restarting Skype) fixed the problem. Good thing, because I was &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; looking forward to reinstalling. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>14910</id><published>2005-09-20T08:13:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-09-20T08:13:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Re: IIS + Skype = Oops</title><content type="html">I ran into that same problem. http://haacked.com/archive/2005/07/11/8583.aspx

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Man, I've suffered from this too, while playing with the VS.NET 2005 Beta 2. I just assumed that the strange 'problems' (i.e. it doesn't work) were because the beta was dodgy.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for spreading the word. I've unchecked that setting now. Perhaps I'll be able to debug my ASP.NET 2.0 projects now...
&lt;br /&gt;

I basically had to because I wanted to add security, and the current design isn't extensible enough to do that without causing a major mess. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As I've been going through the code, it has occurred to me that I could benefit from some of the features that .NET 2.0 has to offer. So I'm thinking of upgrading. Here's the catch: it would mean that when I ship the code, everyone's going to have to install .NET 2.0 if they want to use the new version. Hence my dilemma. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;See, the tricky part is figuring out how big a deal it is to say, "You must have .NET 2.0 to use &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt;." Eventually, of course, it won't be a big deal at all. But right now, it's actually a showstopper, since (AFAIK) you can't go live on the version that corresponds to VS2005 RC1. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Of course, there's basically no chance I'll finish before .NET 2.0 ships. It's too much work, and I'm progressing too slowly for it to be done before November, so I'm not too worried about the licensing situation. But the question remains: how long after November is long enough? Zero days? A year? Obviously, that answer is going to differ from individual to individual, so the challenge is to figure out an answer that's "right enough". &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;At the moment, I'm thinking that the right thing to do is to go ahead and upgrade. There are a number of reasons why I think this will work. For one thing, like I said, it's not going to be done for a while. For another, there's nothing that says people &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to upgrade - they can install it whenever .NET 2.0 becomes an option for them. And finally, because &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; is a web application, and because ASP.NET 1.1 and 2.0 coexist peacefully, the upgrade should be possible for most people. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'm not going to do the conversion until at least October 1st. I announced my intention a few days back on the &lt;a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/flexwiki-users"&gt;FlexWiki Users Mailing List&lt;/a&gt;, but I thought it might be a good idea to mention it here as well.

&lt;br /&gt;As for the primary question - since you're donating your valuable time to produce a free product, I say whatever makes you most productive is fine by me. ASP.NET 2.0 is a huge improvement (mostly) - might as well take advantage of it.

An enumeration? A hashtable? Decisions about data structures abound. Which is one of the reasons I like Whidbey so much - the new support for generics makes life in the collection world ever so much nicer. But the other day I was poking around and came across System.Collectons.ObjectModel - a sister namespace to System.Collections.Generic, and one I hadn't heard much about. But it makes the story even better. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There's not a whole lot in the namespace at the moment. Just three classes: Collection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;, ReadOnlyCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;, and KeyedCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;. Collection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; and ReadOnlyCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; are pretty obvious - they provide simple collection and read-only collection wrapper functionality. Handy, but my favorite is KeyedCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;KeyedCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; is an abstract base class that gives you that Hashtable/ArrayList crossover class you've probably written at least once in your life. That is, it gives you list semantics, but adds a non-integer indexer for doing lookups in the collection. So, for example, if you have a Person class that looks like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;class Person {&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  private int _age;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  private string _name; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  public int Age { get { return _age; } set { _age = value; } }&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  public int Name { get { return _name; } set { _name = value; } }&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;All you need to do is create a collection like this&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;class People : KeyedCollection&amp;lt;string, Person&amp;gt; { &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;   protected override string GetKeyForItem(Person item) {&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;      return item.Name; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;   } &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;where the implementation of GetKeyForItem is whatever makes sense. It's the only method you need to override, because without it, the collection has no idea what the key is. But once you do, you can now access the collection as follows: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;People instructors = Pluralsight.Instructors; // Acquire a collection from somewhere&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Person craig = instructors[7];        // Can access by index&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Person keith = instructors["Keith"]; // Or by name&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In addition to being convenient, the documentation also suggests that KeyedCollection was implemented to provide roughly constant-time lookups by either index or key regardless of the size of the collection. Whether that means "consistently fast" or "consistently slow" I haven't measured yet. :) But I think the best part might just be that the class you derive from KeyedCollection is serializable via XmlSerializer, despite having dictionary-like semantics. That's basically the end of the old "Damn! I can't serialize a Hashtable" problem. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>15</thr:total></entry><entry><id>15434</id><published>2005-10-11T10:21:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-10-11T10:21:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection</title><content type="html">Thanks for the post.

So I wrote this:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;    public class GenericKeyedCollection&amp;lt; K, T &amp;gt; : KeyedCollection&amp;lt; K, T &amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;    {
&lt;br /&gt;        private Converter&amp;lt;T, K&amp;gt; keyRetriever;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;        public GenericKeyedCollection( Converter&amp;lt;T,K&amp;gt; keyRetriever )
&lt;br /&gt;        {
&lt;br /&gt;            this.keyRetriever = keyRetriever;
&lt;br /&gt;        }
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;        protected override K GetKeyForItem(T item)
&lt;br /&gt;        {
&lt;br /&gt;            return keyRetriever(item);
&lt;br /&gt;        }
&lt;br /&gt;    }

&lt;br /&gt;This way you don't need to provide a separate class for each different key retrieval method.

&lt;br /&gt;I generated 1,000,000 Person records, stuck them into a People instance and randomly accessed 1,000,000 entries by key -- 1442ms total and then by index -- 120ms total.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;By comparison, a Hashtable looked up a million entries in 1742ms and an ArrayList in 160ms.  Not bad!  I'm on a 1.5GHz laptop, BTW.

&lt;br /&gt;1) Your implementation of GetHashCode, which would surely be specific to the type of object you were containing, 
&lt;br /&gt;2) What your performance requirements are. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Generally, this sounds like a case of premature optimization.

It's particularly important in this case because the code in question is a service that needs to run for a long time under high load. It also needs to shut down gracefully if something wonky happens. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One of the things I noticed was some weirdness in the OnStop method of the service, where it iterates through its child threads and tries to get them to shut down gracefully, calling Abort if they won't. Since it turns out that everything important is protected by a database transaction anyway, I suggested a shift to a slightly different model: set it up so it doesn't matter if the threads stop at all. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Part of doing this involves changing the threads to run as &lt;em&gt;background threads&lt;/em&gt;. A background thread is represented by a System.Threading.Thread object like any other thread in the CLR, but it has had its IsBackground property set to true. When you do this, you're saying, "It's okay if the process shuts down while this thread is still running." You may have encountered this already if you've ever used the .NET thread pool for anything - all of its threads are background threads, so even if one of them is still doing something, as soon as your last non-background thread goes away, the process dies. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left" style="DIRECTION: ltr"&gt;Of course, every effort should be made to ensure that the threads exit cleanly, since proper cleanup is better than whatever automatic cleanup you get when a process dies. But this change should at the very least help the service from hanging on shutdown, which makes it easier to support. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>15576</id><published>2005-10-14T12:58:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-10-14T12:58:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Thread.IsBackground</title><content type="html">Good Post!</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="15574"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>15625</id><published>2005-10-17T03:30:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-10-17T03:30:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Thread.IsBackground</title><content type="html">One thing to note here is that you can have multiple shared services per process/AppDomain.

Towards the end, I claimed that you could use XmlSerializer to serialize an instance. Well, it turns out this is only true if you use System.String as the key type. For some reason, the serializer barfs with "The given key was not present in the dictionary" when you try to serialize a collection that's keyed off of any other type. Or at least, any of the other types I tried. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'm not sure if this is a serializer bug, an issue with KeyedCollection, or if it's a by-design limitation for some subtle reason. I know I'd sure like it if it started working in the RTM version of Whidbey. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: &lt;/strong&gt;Astute readers Aaron and Bart figured out that this is due to &lt;a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/productfeedback/viewFeedback.aspx?feedbackid=222ed66b-7f8a-4ab7-9ec6-5508c1d47f14"&gt;a bug in XmlSerializer&lt;/a&gt; (a bug which made #1 on the &lt;a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/productfeedback/"&gt;MSDN Product Feedback Center&lt;/a&gt;). Apparently XmlSerializer calls the &lt;em&gt;object IList.this[int index] &lt;/em&gt;indexer, rather than the type-specific indexer. Fortunately, there's an easy workaround: just add an new indexer which hides the indexer in the base class. Modifying my earlier example, you'd do this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;class People : KeyedCollection&amp;lt;string, Person&amp;gt; { &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;   protected override string GetKeyForItem(Person item) {&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;      return item.Name; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;   } &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;   public new Person this[int index] {&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;      get { return ((IList&amp;lt;Person&amp;gt;)this)[index];&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;   }&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I've put the new code in bold. Of course, it already works when string is the key type, but you get the idea. The key here is the "new" keyword on the method, which makes this indexer hide the indexer in the base class, causing it to be used instead. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I've included a more complete sample below that uses a DateTime (birthday) as the key type instead of a string. Note that (as far as I can figure so far) you &lt;strong&gt;can't&lt;/strong&gt; use an int as the key type, because that conflicts with the positional indexer already exposed by IList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;. And it makes sense - if I were representing age as an integer, and my age were 33, how would I know whether people[33] meant "the 33rd person" or "the person with age 33"? &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; System;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; System.Collections.Generic;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; System.Collections.ObjectModel; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; System.IO; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; System.Text;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; System.Xml; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; System.Xml.Serialization; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; SerializeKeyedCollection {&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; Program {&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Main(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;[] args) {&lt;br /&gt;            &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// Set up a collection with two people in it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;            People people = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; People();&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;            Person craig = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Person();&lt;br /&gt;            craig.Name = &lt;span class="str"&gt;"Craig"&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;            craig.Birthday = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; DateTime(1971, 11, 29);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;            people.Add(craig);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;            Person alice = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Person();&lt;br /&gt;            alice.Name = &lt;span class="str"&gt;"Alice"&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;            alice.Birthday = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; DateTime(1973, 11, 3);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;            people.Add(alice);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;            &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// Serialize the collection to a string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;            StringBuilder stringBuilder = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; StringBuilder();&lt;br /&gt;            StringWriter stringWriter = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; StringWriter(stringBuilder); &lt;br /&gt;            XmlSerializer ser = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; XmlSerializer(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;(People));&lt;br /&gt;            ser.Serialize(stringWriter, people);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;            &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// Print out the serialized collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;            &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; xml = stringBuilder.ToString();&lt;br /&gt;            Console.WriteLine(xml);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;            &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// Deserialize the collection to show that deserialization works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;            StringReader stringReader = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; StringReader(xml);&lt;br /&gt;            people = (People) ser.Deserialize(stringReader);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It has a string key.
Serializer does not throw any exceptions but it does not serialise the properties of object.
So, if I refer to example above, xml output is-

&lt;ArrayOfPerson&gt;

This is exactly the problem I ran into, and your solution worked beautifully.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="15696"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>15770</id><published>2005-10-21T06:05:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-10-21T06:05:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">IList&amp;amp;lt;T&amp;amp;gt; Won't XmlSerialize!</title><content type="html">&lt;div&gt;So as long as we're &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/10/19/15696.aspx"&gt;talking about XmlSerializer bugs&lt;/a&gt;, let me point out a really, really bad one: if your type has members of type IList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;, it won't serialize! Aagh! What's worse is that Microsoft &lt;a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/productfeedback/viewfeedback.aspx?feedbackid=faa3cf5c-1c2f-4b46-9e1b-1ad5a2365c4f"&gt;has decided not to fix this bug&lt;/a&gt; until after 2.0. Crap! &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;OK, I can &lt;em&gt;sort of &lt;/em&gt;understand that not everyone uses XmlSerializer directly as their XML API of choice (as I do). So maybe if people like me were the only customers who would be affected by this problem they'd be justified in saying "we'll fix it later". But I'm not: XmlSerializer is used by the ASP.NET web services infrastructure. So if you were thinking of using IList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; properties from your web service parameter types…forget it. Won't work. Guaranteed to be busted in v2.0. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Of course, it's not the end of the world. Generated collection classes (I use &lt;a href="http://www.codesmithtools.com/"&gt;CodeSmith&lt;/a&gt;) have been an option for typesafe collections since v1.0. But generics were supposed to free us from those, not just give us a slightly more efficient way to implement them. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This bug has me pretty annoyed right now, but maybe I'm just moving my way through &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2003/08/23/956.aspx"&gt;The Circle of (Software) Life&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: &lt;/strong&gt;OK, this isn't &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; as bad as I thought. It turns out that List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; will serialize just fine. However, FxCop complains about List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;, and if you've ever tried to use FxCop, you know that dealing with exclusions is often more trouble than it's worth. Fortunately, the FxCop violation that got triggered suggested using either Collection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;, ReadOnlyCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;, or KeyedCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; instead. As you know, I've already &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/10/19/15696.aspx"&gt;worked a bit with KeyedCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;…suddenly System.Collections.ObjectModel seems even cooler. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Anyway, once I switched over to using Collection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; (the appropriate choice in this case) everything serializes correctly. Woohoo! I'd be happier with support for IList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;, but I can totally live with this. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I hope you don't mind my constant updates. I was going to be embarrassed about having to constantly correct myself, but then I remembered that this blog is nothing if not a public record of the fact that I still haven't managed to learn everything there is to know. :) &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>15778</id><published>2005-10-21T09:12:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-10-21T09:12:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: IList&amp;amp;lt;T&amp;amp;gt; Won't XmlSerialize!</title><content type="html">Good info to know.

Encouraged by the implications, I did a a little research and I ran across &lt;a href="http://galleon.sf.net"&gt;Galleon&lt;/a&gt; at SourceForge. I downloaded and installed it, and I have to say, it's ever so nice. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Despite a clunky interface typical of open source (and of Java apps), I didn't have too much trouble figuring out how to set up true two-way integration between my PC and the Tivo. I can now move shows back and forth, controlling the process from either the Tivo or my PC. This basically allows me to use the PC as both an archive/backup and a second TV. You can even set up rules so that certain shows are automatically downloaded to the PC. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Of course, I'm only scratching the surface of Galleon. It's really more a Java-based platform for writing custom Tivo apps than it is a transfer program. I've played around a bit with a few of the plugins that ship with the program, but haven't fully plumbed the possibilities. So far, my favorite is the podcast plugin. I like being able to listen to any episode of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/"&gt;Science Friday&lt;/a&gt; in the living room on demand - it brings the Tivo experience to radio. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>15878</id><published>2005-10-24T12:13:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-10-24T12:13:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Master of Pages</title><content type="html">&lt;div&gt;My buddy &lt;a href="mailto:jasonw@develop.com"&gt;Jason Whittington&lt;/a&gt; wrote this fantastic set of lyrics to the tune of Metallica's &lt;a href="http://www.encycmet.com/songs/smmop.shtml"&gt;"Master of Puppets"&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;div&gt;My wife is getting her MBA at Wharton, and Friday was one of her class days. So I planned to take Ellen up to Philadelphia so she wouldn't have to miss Ellen's birthday. Additionally, Alice's parents were staying with us, and I need to drop them off at the airport that same morning. Ellen and I took the train, so already a fair amount of running around was on the schedule, especially given our plans to co-host Ellen's joint birthday party on Sunday with some friends whose daughter was born just a week after Ellen. No big deal, though - just par for the busy parent course. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The level of insanity jumped from "parents of toddler" to "&lt;a href="http://neopoleon.com"&gt;Rory&lt;/a&gt;" at about 2AM Friday morning, though. That's when we got a call from the police letting us know that our good friend Alex had been hit by a car. He was riding his bike home from helping a friend move, and the dirtbag that did it drove off without stopping, leaving Alex lying in the street. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Alex is a triathlete, who has competed in several Ironman events just this year, including the big one in Hawaii. If you're not familiar with Ironman (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_Triathlon"&gt;Wikipedia entry&lt;/a&gt;), it consists of a 2-mile swim, followed by a 112-mile bike, followed by a 26.2-mile run. That's right - it &lt;strong&gt;ends&lt;/strong&gt; with a full marathon. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Anyway, all this is to say that Alex has probably biked almost 7000 miles just this year, all of it with a helmet. And of course, this time, on a short one-mile trip home, he wasn't wearing one. Fortunately, Alex was not killed. He didn't even suffer any head injuries. He did get hurt, though, and not in a small way: several ribs broken, two seriously; a broken collarbone; and worst of all two fractured vertebrae, one of them basically crushed. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The prognosis for Alex's full recovery is quite good. Even now, just three days later, he can walk, even up and down stairs, albeit very, very slowly and with a cane. He'll need to wear a back brace for several months, and it takes him a long time to get in or out of a chair or a bed right now. We've all wondered where he'd be at if he weren't in essentially perfect physical condition before he got hit. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Getting hit by a car will generally always ruin your day, but this already hasn't really been his year. He lost his job after getting screwed by an unscrupulous consulting company, his visa to stay in the US is expiring, his landlord is selling the house he's living in, and perhaps worst of all he has no health insurance. Yikes. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;He was released from the hospital yesterday. Of course, we insisted that he come to stay with us. It works well because either Alice or I are basically always at home. Should anything happen, he won't have to lie at the bottom of the stairs for six hours waiting for someone to come home. And we're glad to help. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Anyway, like I said, a crazy weekend. I had planned to do a post about what I've been up to work-wise, but when you work at home a lot, your work and personal lives tend to blur together a bit. So I thought I'd start here - sometime soon I'll do the complementary post. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>16062</id><published>2005-10-31T10:52:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-10-31T10:52:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Long Weekend</title><content type="html">Damn.

&lt;br /&gt;I will never let enhanced CD's even launch their garbage on my machine again.  I wish these dinosaurs would just hurry up and go extinct.    
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;From now on I plan to pirate any Sony crap that crosses my path, just on general principal.

As part of the process, we've added a web service façade that exposes a good chunk of their functionality. It's been really interesting figuring out how to do that correctly. One of the things I recommended is that they put a catch (Exception) block in every [WebMethod]. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The idea here is to control completely what goes out on the wire. If uncaught exceptions are allowed to propagate outside the WebMethod, the pipeline will call ToString() on the exception object and stick the result into the soap:fault. That means that we're projecting stuff like our call stack and the exception type onto the wire. This is neither useful nor desirable to the clients of the web service. Even if it was, the format the information is in would be a pain to parse. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So instead, we've done something like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;[WebMethod] FooResult DoFoo(FooRequest request) {&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;   try {&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;      CheckSecurity();&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;      return ExecuteFoo(request); &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  }&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  catch (Exception e)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  {&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;     throw LogAndMapException(e);&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  }&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Where LogAndMapException looks something like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;SoapException LogAndMapException(Exception e) {&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  LogException(e);&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  CustomException ce = e as CustomException;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  if (ce != null) {&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;    return CreateSoapException(ce.Code, ce.FriendlyMessage);&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  }&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  else { &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;    return CreateSoapException("generic error message"); &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  }&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;CustomException is an exception that we wrote that is thrown when application-specific error conditions occur. When we get this, we know we have information that might be useful to the client, for example, "You do not have permission to do what you tried to do." In this case, we create a SoapException that contains a code and a convenient human-readable string for that error. In all other cases, we throw a SoapException that just contains a generic error message. So we return as much information as we have, but not more than the client needs. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The key here is that when SoapException is thrown, the pipeline knows that you're trying to make the soap:fault look a particular way, and it'll map the properties of the SoapException into the fault message, rather than simply dumping the result of ToString() into it. Very handy. Except when it stops working. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Which is exactly what happened to us the other day. Since we have a UI that displays the human-readable part of the fault in a web page, it was pretty obvious to us that we were getting the stackdump style of message, rather than the nicely formatted one. To add to the mystery, we couldn't recreate the error on any of our dev machines - only on the web farm we deploy to as part of every build. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;But wait! There's more! There are two nodes in the web farm (we'll call them A and B), and as I was playing around with the setup, I found that the problem only occurred when I pointed the web UI on A to the web service on A. If the web UI on A talked to the web service on B (and vice versa) the problem went away. Even weirder, if I set up &lt;a href="http://pocketsoap.com/"&gt;tcpTrace&lt;/a&gt; as a simple call redirector so that web service calls went from machine A to machine C &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; to machine A, things &lt;strong&gt;also&lt;/strong&gt; worked correctly. And I tried addressing the calls using the machine's full name, "localhost" and "127.0.0.1", but none of that made a difference. As long as the call didn't leave the machine, the error text was wrong. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;After much screwing around trying to get remote debugging to work (with little success, as usual with that technology), I asked a few friends if they'd seen this before. Fortunately, the inestimable &lt;a href="http://complexit.com/"&gt;Henk&lt;/a&gt; had. (Henk is one of the smartest guys I know - hire him if you ever get the chance.) It turned out to simply be a matter of adding &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;lt;customErrors mode="On" /&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;to the web.config for the web service. Poof! Problem gone. I suppose it makes sense in retrospect that this tag would control pipeline mapping of unhandled exceptions for web services the same way it does for ASP.NET web forms, but frankly I found the resulting behavior highly unintuitive. I also can't explain why it only failed on our Windows 2003 web farm, and not on any of the other Windows 2003 or Windows XP machines we tried. But at least we're up and running again. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>16158</id><published>2005-11-02T07:42:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-11-02T07:42:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Unwanted Stack Trace in Web Services</title><content type="html">Craig-
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I have this suspicion that your Web farm didn't have the default ASP.NET error pages on it - when you have CustomErrors set to OFF, your web server will look for these pages and blow up with a 404 if it can't find them.  I don't know if this sounds like it could have had something to do with your issues or not...

I also said I'd post about what I've been doing for work. Ah - the classic blogger conceit: the surety that you care. :)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;At any rate, right now I have four projects going simultaneously. Balancing them has, at times, been tricky, but so far I've managed to keep all of them moving forward without having to work nights or weekends. (Wife in school plus toddler means I couldn't really do that anyway.) I'll describe each of them briefly. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol type="1" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e.POWER 2005&lt;/strong&gt;. For the last three years, I've been helping my client &lt;a href="http://www.integic.com/"&gt;Integic&lt;/a&gt; port part of their e.POWER workflow product to .NET. At the same time we move existing functionality, we've also been adding a web services façade, with the obvious goal of making it easier to integrate e.POWER workflow services into their applications. I've been acting as an architectural consultant, advising on how to design and implement the system, but I also wrote big chunks of the security system, pretty much all of the database access library, and pretty much all of the build system, as well as a bunch of other bits and pieces. We're nearly ready to ship it, and I'm eager to see what happens when the bits go into action at a real, live customer. I think the answer is "good things", but the proof is in the pudding.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;No surprise here - if you read this blog, you know that I've been doing a massive refactoring of the &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; codebase, which includes a port to .NET 2.0. The end goal is to implement good application-level security in &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt;, but to do that I'm going to wind up rewriting most of the core of &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt;. When I'm done, I hope it'll be much more extensible and quite a bit less tangled than it is now. Since no one's paying me to do this one, it has the lowest priority, but I'm still trying to devote an hour to it every day, with the hope that I can get something back into the community some time in early 2006. We'll see how I do on that one. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pluralsight's Applied .NET Architecture &amp;amp; Design Course.&lt;/strong&gt; The sharp-eyed have noticed that Pluralsight have announced several new courses, among them &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/appliedDotNetArch.aspx"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;. I'm in the middle of writing the slides now, and it has been very challenging, mostly due to the nature of the material. How, exactly, does one teach "architecture" in four days? What does a lab exercise for a lecture entitled "service orientation" look like? Despite the challenges, I'm very pleased with the way the course is shaping up, and I hope to see a few of you in class once we start teaching it. &lt;/li&gt;

I've got some really interesting stuff to talk about on this one, but I'm going to wait until a few things come together.

&lt;div&gt;The fact that I generally put time in on at least three of them most days makes for a lot of variety. I particularly like that I've got a mix of design and implementation going - nothing helps you figure out how to build something more than trying to build it (or something similar). &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>16190</id><published>2005-11-03T09:35:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-11-03T09:35:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: What Has Craig Been Working On?</title><content type="html">Have you ever taken a look at the downloadable PHP documentation?  One of the *really* nice things about it is that they have developer comments in there for all to see.  For example, I can see the community's suggestions on how to use the function that's documented, why it's there, and possible gotchas.  It'd be really great if MS put something like this feature in MSDN2 (or maybe even MSDN3).  I imagine it would take some moderators/some voting sort of system to make it work, but it would certainly be a nice cure for the common:

&lt;div&gt;I'm a keyboard guy. That's why I love discovering new shortcuts. Today, when working in VS2005, I accidentally hit ctrl-alt-down arrow. So I was surprised when up popped a scrollable list of my open windows. You can even type the first few letters of the filename to navigate the list. I like it better than ctrl-tab when I know the name of the window I want to open, because it doesn't make me visually scan a big unordered list. When I know I want the last window, or the one before that, ctrl-tab still wins. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>9</thr:total></entry><entry><id>16204</id><published>2005-11-04T11:09:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-11-04T11:09:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: My New Favorite VS2005 Key Sequence</title><content type="html">This is cool.

It's only about two blocks anyway, and I've walked over there four times in the last two weeks. The first three times were to visit my friend Alex, who got &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/10/31/16061.aspx"&gt;hit by a car&lt;/a&gt;. This latest time, though, was all me. Nothing &lt;em&gt;quite &lt;/em&gt;so serious, but nonetheless not an experience I hope ever to repeat. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I was in my basement on Sunday, working on building a bench for my new &lt;a href="http://www.deltamachinery.com/index.asp?e=136&amp;amp;p=5853"&gt;planer&lt;/a&gt;. I've been buying a lot of tools lately, and it's starting to get a bit crowded down there, so I figured I'd work on some storage. So I was running a 2x4 through the table saw to cut it down to size.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'm not entirely sure what happened next. My memory is a bit hazy for those few seconds. But I think I was concentrating on keeping one of my hands away from the blade, and didn't pay quite enough attention to the other. What I &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; remember pretty clearly is jumping away from the saw, yelling loudly, and clutching my thumb. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Before I go too much further, let me say that I did &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;sever any digits. I gave myself a really nasty cut across the pad of my thumb, but I didn't slice anything completely off. I'd say it's about a five or six on a scale of one to ten, where one is a paper cut, and ten is the aforementioned digit removal. The nurse at the ER (where I spent the next four hours) gave me an "A+", though. :p&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Here's a picture of the rather nifty bandage they gave me. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://pluralsight.com/craig/images/thumb-bandaged.jpg" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;They had to put it on with a special tool - it was sort of a cage that stretched a tubular piece of gauze out, and they fed it up and down, creating layers. Very clever, I thought. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;If you want to see what it looks like underneath the bandage, well, what's wrong with you?!? :) But click &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/craig/images/thumb-unbandaged.jpg"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and check it out if you must. Warning to those with a weak stomach: it's gross. Warning to those with a highly developed photoaesthetic sense: the picture is poorly taken. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Anyway, it looks like I'll heal up in a few weeks. Right now, I can't feel the tip of my thumb, but I'm hoping that will come back. In the meantime, it hasn't interfered with my typing too much, and that's the important thing, since it's how I earn my bread. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The weirdest thing about the whole experience has been observing the mental and physical effects. I've never really hurt myself seriously before, so it was odd to feel myself going through the typical reactions. First was physical shock - I was disoriented and sweating for a few minutes right after. And then of course there was disbelief ("there's no way I just turned my thumb into a tiny pile of hamburger!"), anger (as I was walking to the ER I was &lt;strong&gt;super&lt;/strong&gt; pissed that I'd been so stupid), depression (not the real kind, but I was a little down about it for a bit), etc. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;All in all I'd say I was dumb but lucky. Which beats dumb and unlucky or even smart and unlucky. In the future I'm hoping to be smart and lucky. I also hope to return to amateur carpentry (&lt;em&gt;sans&lt;/em&gt; the amateur surgery), but one thing I'm not sure about yet is whether this whole incident has dampened my enthusiasm to the point where I'll just find something else to do any time it's time to turn on the power tools. But if I &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; go back to it (as I intend to), I know this: I'm going to incorporate the piece of wood that I was cutting into the final product. Preferably with the bloodstain showing. Just something from my own twisted sense of revenge I guess. Or stubbornness. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So, woodworkers: be careful out there. Pay attention, build or buy whatever jig you need to make the cut safely, and think before you act. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I've been lucky so far with my own carpentry hobbies, but it probably has a *lot* to do with a close call of my own.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I've never forgotten about the time I went to cut a ~1" off the end of a 2x4 with my compound mitre saw.  Since I was trying to just finish something up and rushing, I didn't don my safety glasses like usual.  I was probably thinking "Heck, I can be done w/this cut by the time I walk waaay over there, get my glasses, put them on, and then walk waaay back over here."  Mind you, "waay over there" was probably all of 8 steps.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, when the saw blade made the final cut through the bottom edge of the board, that 1" chunk ricocheted off the cutting surface at a zillion miles an hour headed for my face.  Lucky for me it whizzed by my temple and didn't hit me in the eye.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I've never forgotten that, so I'm pretty paranoid about safety goggles for my eyes and homemade jigs that keep my hands further away from saw blades.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="16440"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>16447</id><published>2005-11-10T10:16:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-11-10T10:16:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Don't Argue With Power Tools</title><content type="html">Yeah, the thought has crossed my mind that it's going to be a *lot* easier in the future to "find" the time to do things carefully.

&lt;br /&gt;I'm so glad you're ok.  The optimist in me believes it could be worse...or, worse yet, you could've done what my co-worker did and almost cut his pinky finger off with a miter saw.  The contraption they had him wear had all these wires coming from the wrist to support each finger and he had to go in for occupational therapy so they could make his hand black and blue trying to break up internal scar tissue.  Ouch.

&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, you'll be happy to hear that last weekend I felt brave enough to fire up the table saw again. It was really scary, though. But then again I suppose it should be. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Amusingly, my friends and relatives had a good time giving me joke gifts for Christmas: Batman band-aids, a new push shoe (which is actually really nice) and a "cut proof glove".

&lt;br /&gt;Hope you heal quickly.

Last wednesday, late afternoon, I was looking for something to knock off before leaving a renovation site... I had a 6 inch piece of 2 x 4 that needed a notch cut into it, easily done with a chisel had I not left it at home... so instead I picked an angle grinder with a 4 inch demolition blade (wood) to do the job... I thought it could be dangerous but somehow decided to go for it... no vise around so I held the piece of wood in my left hand and the grinder in my right... at some point the blade skidded on the wood and went to work on my left hand and then my thigh. Luckily I had the blade guard in the safest position so the tool did bounce off my thigh... The damage: 7 stitches to the thigh and near amputation of my left thumb (cut through two extensor ligaments, nerves and completely through the metacarpal) Horrible, scary wound, but my mind worked fine as I immediately grabbed a clean towel and applied pressure until the ambulance arrived... almost fainted though... did go through shock... I'm getting reconstructive surgery this coming wednesday but somehow still have feeling in my thumb and can actually bend it inwards. 
I was incredibly lucky. I have no workers comp, no insurance and will be without income until I heal. But I was LUCKY. Could have been much worse. 
I'm always very careful around tools except for that one time. It only takes one act of foolishness to cause severe injury guys. Be careful out there.
Hopefully the flashbacks will stick around for a long time so that I remain careful 100% of the time.

Be safe.

what "cut-proof" glove did you end up getting?
I almost cut my thumb entirely off about a month ago with a "chop-saw" / power compound miter saw. I'm still wearing a cast and am looking forward to several months of physical therapy -- not! 

It cut through the top tendon and bone. It remained attached only by the bottom tendon. I'm recovering - slowly.
I am feeling unable to resume using that type of tool ever again but might feel more inclined to try if I could acquire that type of glove. Please help.

Does anybody know of a "safer" type of miter saw? The Saw-Stop is only available for table-saws.

I believe it's the sort used in food preparation. I don't think it's a good idea to use during power tool operation. 

Frankly, I think blade-to-hand accidents are pretty much always caused by improper operation. It certainly was in my case. There's pretty much no reason to have your fingers within three inches of the blade. Certainly, a "cut-proof glove" isn't going to do it. 

I definitely understand the feeling of being apprehensive about the tool. The first time I came back to the table saw after my accident, I was terrified. I still fear it, which I think is a good thing. 

As far as a safer type of saw, I have a few recommendations: 

1) Learn to use your tools more safely. Use jigs or fixtures any time you think it would make the operation safer. Yes, it's slower. It's not as slow as six months of PT. 
2) Get a bandsaw. Properly tuned, they can do many operations as well as a miter saw, and I find them to be much safer to operate, especially given that they can't kick back (kickback is actually a bigger source of injury than blade contact), although they still require caution. 
3) Get a SawStop. You can do almost anything on a table saw that you can do with a miter saw, and you can generally do it more accurately. 
4) Check out this awesome-looking tool: 

http://www.bridgecitytools.com/Products/What%27s+New/Jointmaker+Pro 

It's basically a Japanese pull saw with a sliding table. Check out the demonstration videos - looks like it does a fantastic job, and since it's human-powered, it's probably quite a bit safer than a miter saw. Although you still need to keep your digits away from the blade. </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="16440"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>56297</id><published>2009-01-20T16:30:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-01-20T16:30:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Don't Argue With Power Tools</title><content type="html">Hope you're doing ok now. I wanted to find someone with a similar injury to me - my dog bit the end of my thumb off! He's only a little terrier - I was trying to stop him being attacked by my other dog and my hand got in the way when I was trying to separate them. Unfortunately, they couldn't find the end at the time, so the wound just healed over without it being sewn on. I still have half my nail - it's just a diddy thumb now, about 3cm shorter than the other one but looks fairly passable.

It feels weird though - there's a hard ridge over the pad that aches a bit sometimes, and although it's all joined up, it feels like there's a hole. Still, it's only 2 and a half months since I did it, so who knows!

Can't crack eggs. do up buttons or necklaces very easily now. Still, I can now manipulate the hand brake on my car, so some function is coming back. Have to use a different method to put on a bra too.

Still got the dog. He was only defending himself - rehoused the other one. </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="16440"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>17134</id><published>2005-11-27T07:11:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-11-27T07:11:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Triple Whammy</title><content type="html">&lt;div&gt;It's been a bit quiet around here, but there's been good reason. As you know, &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/10/31/16061.aspx"&gt;my friend Alex got hit by a car&lt;/a&gt;. The next weekend, &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/11/10/16440.aspx"&gt;I sliced my thumb up with a table saw&lt;/a&gt;. Well, the weekend after &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt;, the worst of the lot happened: I got a call from one of my brothers telling me that my dad had lost consciousness while returning from a vacation. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;They say things happen in threes, and I certainly hope that's true, because after this one I'm ready for a break from hospitals. It turns out that my dad had an &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000162.htm"&gt;abdominal aortic aneurysm&lt;/a&gt; (a "triple A"). Briefly, this means that the large artery that leads downward from his heart had weakened and swelled. I saw the CT scan at one point: it was roughly the size of an American football. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;My dad got lucky on several counts. To start with, he'd just traded places with my mom when he passed out, so he wasn't driving. That could easily have killed them both. On top of that, even though they were in northern Minnesota (which is basically the middle of nowhere), they happened to be near a hospital, so the ambulance was able to get him to a doctor quickly. And the doctor was good enough to get the diagnosis right and immediately put my dad on a helicopter for a hospital in &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Duluth,+MN&amp;amp;spn=5.746228,19.872070&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Duluth&lt;/a&gt;. And the vascular surgeon in Duluth managed to repair my dad's artery, saving his life. Dad's blood pressure dropped to zero at one point, so it was a near thing. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The whole family descended on Duluth, of course. Dad was in the ICU for a week, but has since been transferred to the cardiac recovery unit. He's still in Duluth, but the rest of the family has started returning to their homes now that the largest dangers are past. We're all hoping that he'll be home by Christmas when we all return, although it's no sure thing. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One of the worst parts about the whole process was that my dad was so completely looped by the drugs and the shock and the sleep deprivation that he was basically delirious until about nine days after the surgery. And it wasn't until about eight days out that anyone was able to tell us it wasn't a stroke. It was pretty hard on my mom to hear my dad basically babbling nonsense about how he wasn't really in a hospital. Fortunately, sleep and changes of medication fixed that up and dad is now as sharp as ever.  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We spent the Thanksgiving holiday there in a hotel. My wife and my brother did a bang-up job of whipping up a first-rate giant meal using only a microwave and what they could find at the grocery store on Thursday afternoon. Still, I can certainly think of better ways to spend the holiday. But I can &lt;strong&gt;much &lt;/strong&gt;more easily think of worse ways. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align="left"&gt;I definitely recommend that you upgrade to this release if you're currently running 1.8.0.1677. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'm guessing this will be the last official release of &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; before 2.0. (You can always get unsupported interim releases from &lt;a href="http://builds.flexwiki.com"&gt;http://builds.flexwiki.com&lt;/a&gt;.) I've been working away in my spare (ha!) time on gutting and rearchitecting the content engine, and I've been making slow but steady progress. It'll probably be a few months before I get it to alpha status, but once there I should be able to start making rapid progress on implementing security and some caching improvements. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>17286</id><published>2005-12-05T09:14:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-12-05T09:14:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: FlexWiki 1.8.0.1696 Released</title><content type="html">I's great to see that first bug gone :) I'm already running the latest code and I had only minor issues with Presentations.Image requiring more parameters.

I don't like it. No sir, I don't like it one bit. :) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Here's the deal. A conversion operator is just a way of writing a method that you invoke using the C# casting syntax. The thing is, since it's a method, why not just &lt;strong&gt;make&lt;/strong&gt; it a method. If I were writing this code, I'd call it ToUpdateItem() or perhaps emphasize its a factory nature by calling it something like CreateFromUpdateItem.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There are two problems with the type conversion operator approach as I see it. First, you're providing something that implies type compatibility, when really no such type relationship exists. Second, the conversion operator syntax implies that no new instance is created, when in fact a new object instance is created every time. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;With a plain ol' method, people who maintain your code can see exactly what's going on. With a type conversion operator, you're just twisting the language syntax to make it look like one thing is happening, when really something else is. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A good rule of thumb is that if you see yourself typing "public static operator", you're doing something wrong. :) &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>22</thr:total></entry><entry><id>17353</id><published>2005-12-09T10:30:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-12-09T10:30:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: C# Type Conversion Operators Considered Harmful</title><content type="html">Why don't you say what you really feel Craig? :)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I can see your point, but I would argue that that type conversion makes sense when you are in fact converting types, which is what I'm doing. I'm not twisting the language syntax if I'm using it's native conversion operator (casting) to change one type into another type.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="17351"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>17354</id><published>2005-12-09T10:42:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-12-09T10:42:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: C# Type Conversion Operators Considered Harmful</title><content type="html">No, you're not converting type.

This means that the cast (or 'conversion' in this case, in the real "you get a new object on the heap" sense) is a function of the *implementation*, and not a function of the *interface*. So, a method is better for that reason too, as it makes the interface clear (separate from the implementation, with regard to what it's possible to define on an 'interface' should you so desire).

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Of course you could write a method, but the same could be said of properties, constructors, interface method dispatching, etc. These are language features you can leverage to make the types you build more intuitive to work with. I personally dislike nested chains of method calls:
&lt;br /&gt;ws.UpdateItem(item.ToUpdateItem());
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;and think the casting syntax is a bit cleaner:
&lt;br /&gt;ws.UpdateItem((UpdateItem)item);

His type converters aren't changing between types that have wildly different meanings, as in the case of calling myDate.ToString(). It's simply changing the type to allow an object to be passed to a method that has an arbitrary requirement for a different type (a WSDL generated method). I don't see much difference between what he does and converting from an int to a double, for example, so that you can pass an int to a function that wants a double. In fact, I think an implicit operator would be fine in his scenario. As long as web service proxies insist on generating new types without letting you override this behavior, might as well provide the simplest way to access the methods.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Ok, that is a good point. If you had a reference to one type, and you cast it to another, you typically expect them to still be the same object, so that changes in one are reflected in the other. Implementing the conversion operator nullifies this assumption, and arguably makes it more confusing for the client of the class.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So is the general consensus the same as Craig's -  "if you see yourself typing 'public static operator', you're doing something wrong" ? Anyone have a good example of using conversion operators effectively in C#?

If I wrote a BigInt library, I think it's much more reasonable to define (for example) conversion operators to and from int, addition, etc. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But even there I think you should *also* have the normal methods: ToInt32(), Add(), etc. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Dilip: they don't *have* to be compatible, of course, in the sense that the code will still work. But it's about expectations. "Type conversion" operator implies type compatibility to most people. If it didn't, it would be legal to cast a string to an int (like it is in C++). 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;For example, let's say I wrote this: 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;public static operator==(Foo a, Foo b)
&lt;br /&gt;{
&lt;br /&gt;  if (IsTuesday()) { return false; }
&lt;br /&gt;  else { return a.Equals(b); }
&lt;br /&gt;}
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This is a case of reducto ad absurdum, of course, but it makes the point clear - it's a bad idea to make things work in a non-obvious way, because you're going to force people to have to understand the code in a deep way. Here, we've overloaded the == operator to something that *almost* means "equality". In the same way, I contend that Fritz has overloaded the type conversion operator to something that *almost* means type conversion.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="17351"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>17370</id><published>2005-12-09T12:52:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-12-09T12:52:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: C# Type Conversion Operators Considered Harmful</title><content type="html">&amp;gt; So is the general consensus the same as Craig's - "if you see yourself typing 'public static operator', you're doing something wrong" ? &amp;lt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'd say you'd only ever use 'conversion' to go from one immutable value type to another. You'd never want conversions for classes. You already have a type system for that (i.e. inherit from a class, or implement the appropriate interface, then just 'cast' if necessary). If a 'cast' isn't appropriate (such as when you do actually want a new and different reference type), then you should just use a method. Like Craig said, something like UpdateItem.CreateFromPrototype( Item ), or UpdateItem.Convert( Item )...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'd say 'conversions' are there just for the sake of value types (which aren't 'proper' objects).

&lt;br /&gt;}
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;public void DoStuff( Foo2 foo )
&lt;br /&gt;{
&lt;br /&gt;  foo.Property1 = "New Value";
&lt;br /&gt;}
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;[STAThread()]
&lt;br /&gt;public static int Main( string[] args )
&lt;br /&gt;{
&lt;br /&gt;  Foo1 foo = new Foo1();
&lt;br /&gt;  foo.Property1 = "Old Value";
&lt;br /&gt;  DoStuff(foo);
&lt;br /&gt;  Console.WriteLine(foo.Property1);
&lt;br /&gt;}
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Without running it, one might be inclined to expect that it would print "New Value". But it won't because it passed a new object (i.e. not your original foo object) to the method. You have to specify it as a ref or out parameter for it to work -- which is a little counter-intuitive until you realize what's going on in the code IMO.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="17351"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>52691</id><published>2008-08-22T14:27:57.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-08-22T14:27:57.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: C# Type Conversion Operators Considered Harmful</title><content type="html">Guess I'm a little late to this thread - but how would you solve this without a conversion operator:

Some of the controls that come with the framework like ComboBox take only an "object" type, yet usually developers want to store an object and a string to be displayed in the combobox.

If you add a string conversion operator to your class you can just add them to the combobox and you are done.

The item text is automatically displayed correctly, and the object is retrievable at at any time during a selection event of via enumeration.

Is there another way to do this without adding extra classes or methods?

So that's mostly been thought of for the visual stuff. 

In many other contexts, when someone wants to display an object, they look first for an implementation of IFormattable::Format, and then for an implementation of ToString. I'm not sure how you'd ever pull this off "without adding extra classes or methods" - there's no useful universal algorithm for displaying an object. </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="17351"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>90492</id><published>2010-07-05T13:20:50.0-05:00</published><updated>2010-07-05T13:20:50.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: C# Type Conversion Operators Considered Harmful</title><content type="html">Agree with Craig here, Casting means you still have to reference to the same object, and implies there is some kind of relationship between the two object.

By "custom" I mean "written by hand, not generated by the ASP.NET web services infrastructure". In this case, it's because we've got a bunch of external schema types that we'd like to use in a certain way, but you might want to do the same thing for a variety of reasons, including just not liking the way the generated WSDL looks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;As it turns out, using an external WSDL is fairly easy. It's just a little obscure - I had a hard time tracking down how to do it using Google, so I'm documenting the process here. Following, the steps required:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;Write a custom WSDL file.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;Use the tool of your choice. The one thing you're going to want to do is to omit the &amp;lt;wsdl:service&amp;gt; declaration. This bit actually will be generated by the ASP.NET infrastructure. That makes sense, since it contains a URL, and can be more easily determined at runtime. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drop the WSDL in the web directory next to your .asmx file. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;Presumably, you still want people to be able to download your custom WSDL, so putting it somewhere web-accessible is a good idea. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;Mark your web service implementation class with the [WebServiceBinding] attribute.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;For instance, you might do something like this: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;The most important thing to set here is the Location property, which tells ASP.NET where your custom WSDL file lives. The Name property gives the name of the &amp;lt;wsdl:binding&amp;gt; from your custom WSDL, and is needed by ASP.NET to allow it to dispatch calls onto your implementation correctly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;For example: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;The Action property associates this method with the action listed in your WSDL file. It is particularly important because ASP.NET chooses which method to invoke based on the action in the incoming message. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;The binding element associates the operation with a particular &amp;lt;wsdl:binding&amp;gt;, in much the same way that the Name property of the [WebServiceBinding] attribute does. It’s required to be on the [SoapDocumentMethod] attribute for proper operation, but I still haven’t quite figured out why you need both. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observe the generated WSDL. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;If you surf to the automatically-generated WSDL page (e.g. http://server/path/to/service.asmx?wsdl), you’ll observe that ASP.NET is still generating a WSDL document for you. However, because of the changes you’ve made, that WSDL consists solely of a &amp;lt;wsdl:import&amp;gt; referencing the WSDL file you wrote, and a &amp;lt;wsdl:service&amp;gt; element containing the URL for the service. It’ll look something like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 4pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; MARGIN-TOP: 1pt; PADDING-LEFT: 4pt; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 1pt; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #b3b3b3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;wsdl:definitions targetNamespace="urn:foo-com:service"&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;It all works but I am afraid this is wrong.  I am pretty sure it's in my usage of the namespaces.

&lt;br /&gt;In addition, we have developed a fixed Default***.aspx which will ship with WSCF 0.6.
&lt;br /&gt;Once we have WSCF 0.6 out of the door I will post the code on my blog.

&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again.  I figured out what happened.  You said it in your post, "assuming you write the WSDL correctly".  Funny how that works.  Namespace clashes.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;By the way(to Christian also), I use WSCF .51 and went the binding route due to this not being in WSCF. Greatly appreciated if the Thinktecture guys get this in.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I started with a shell web service and added a web method that takes a single string as a parameter and returns a string as the result.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I compiled and auto generated the WSDL.  At this point the service passes the WS-I basic profile validation.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I then did the following:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;1. Saved the auto generated WSDL to a file.
&lt;br /&gt;2. Commented out the &amp;lt;wsdl:service&amp;gt; section.
&lt;br /&gt;3. Added the WebServiceBinding attribute as you described in your blog entry. ( Location set to the saved WSDL )
&lt;br /&gt;4. Added the SoapDocumentMethod as you described in your blog entry.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;When I run the service now I get warning that the service does not conform to the WS-I Basic Profile because the SOAP 1.1 binding was not found.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The auto gen WSDL now looks like the example in your blog entry.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Am I missing something obvious?  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;thanks
&lt;br /&gt;

For the leaning purpose, I have
created a web service in 2005 with one asmx.cs file, in this file, I
have one method called GetUser() which returns a custom user object,
something like

[WebMethod]
public User GetUser()

When I run it from IDE, I noticed after clicking the Service
Description link that the XSD for my custom object user is missing an
element id, which is a read only property of object, and it would
shown if it's changed to read and write. Then, I followed above example tried to use a custom wsdl that contains xsd of an int id element for my user object, but for some reasons, when I run it, this id element still disappeared, any ideas?

&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The other day, the thing I was fumbling my way through was restoring a database from a backup a client had sent me. While I was doing it, I ran across a neat little option to sqlcmd.exe that I hadn't seen before, but which I definitely want to remember. It's the -v option, and it lets you pass parameters to your SQL script. In my case, I wanted to pass the current directory, so I could restore the database to files in whatever directory I happened to be running. Well, putting this in a .cmd file does the trick: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;sqlcmd -E -i restoredb.sql -v root="%CD%"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Then I can use the &lt;strong&gt;root&lt;/strong&gt; variable in my SQL script. All I have to do is reference it with the &lt;strong&gt;$(root)&lt;/strong&gt; syntax, like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;RESTORE DATABASE MyDB &lt;br /&gt;    FROM DISK = '$(root)\mydb.bak'&lt;br /&gt;    WITH REPLACE,&lt;br /&gt;    MOVE 'mydb_data' to '$(root)\mydb.mdf',&lt;br /&gt;GO&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Nifty, eh? I know I'm far from the first one to "discover" this, but maybe it'll help someone who hasn't seen it before. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>15</thr:total></entry><entry><id>17527</id><published>2005-12-16T19:00:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-12-16T19:00:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Link Listing - December 16, 2005</title><content type="html">ASP.NET Podcast Show #30 - Minimizing the ASP.NET ViewState

I'm bringing y'all along for the ride. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Reviewing my blog, I see that &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/01/03/4725.aspx"&gt;I had one goal for 2005&lt;/a&gt;: ship FlexWikiPad 1.0. Well, that didn't happen. In fact, I didn't even do any significant work on it. Why not? Because I managed to push a couple of major projects onto the stack on top of it (bet &lt;strong&gt;you've&lt;/strong&gt; never done that ;). For one thing, it seems &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/11/20/3586.aspx"&gt;I have to write a whole new text editor control&lt;/a&gt; (something I also didn't finish this year). But more significantly, I decided to completely overhaul the &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; internal architecture to make it possible to implement security in a sane way. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Of course, I didn't finish &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt;, either, but then again I didn't expect to. It's a pretty big job to do in my spare time, and along the way, it morphed into a decision to &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/10/03/15245.aspx"&gt;port FlexWiki to .NET 2.0&lt;/a&gt;. That is actually coming along fairly well, especially now that I try to spend an hour every day working on it. With luck, I'll have something to alpha status in month or two more. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It wasn't all &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; work this past year, though. I had &lt;em&gt;paying &lt;/em&gt;clients, too. My work at &lt;a href="http://www.integic.com/"&gt;Integic&lt;/a&gt; redesigning and updating &lt;a href="http://www.integic.com/epower/index.cfm"&gt;their main product&lt;/a&gt; has, after three years, reached code complete status. That's fairly exciting for me, because as a consultant I rarely get to see a project through from the very beginning. Even more interestingly, it looks like I'll be involved in working on the next phase as well, which means I'll get to see if some of our choices wind up helping us out like we hoped they would. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;My other work in 2005 is still ongoing. I'm developing &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/courses/AppliedDotNetArch.aspx"&gt;Pluralsight's new architecture course&lt;/a&gt;, for one. The research for that has been very educational, as I knew it would be. Hopefully I'll be able to pull the rest of the class together over the next few months. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Of course, my work on &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/default.aspx"&gt;MSDN2&lt;/a&gt; continues as well, but I can't say much about what I'm working on just yet. When we get it in place, you'll definitely hear about it, both here and elsewhere. I think it's something that readers of this blog will find interesting. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As you can see, 2006 is looking to be every bit as busy as 2005 was…and then some. I'm just glad my wife will be graduating from her MBA program in the spring. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'll close with a list of my favorite/most significant events/posts of the year: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completed the &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/01/24/5386.aspx"&gt;build lights system&lt;/a&gt; for my client's project. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helped a reader with &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/01/14/4958.aspx"&gt;his ridiculously nerdy Halloween project&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Posted about &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/02/17/5939.aspx"&gt;defaulted pluggable providers&lt;/a&gt;. I still use this all the time. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Declared that &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/03/11/6653.aspx"&gt;I hate strong names&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Released &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/03/25/6884.aspx"&gt;a new version of FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gave &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/04/27/7786.aspx"&gt;my take on the contract-first/code-first debate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figured out &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/04/27/7783.aspx"&gt;how to make iTunes talk to MSN Messenger&lt;/a&gt;. I mention this one mostly because it appears to be the most popular arrival point for people that would never otherwise read my blog. :) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found out how easy it is to &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/05/27/8636.aspx"&gt;add macro support to your application&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ran into &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/06/22/11709.aspx"&gt;a nasty PerformanceCounter bug&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I came across a cool trick: &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/06/26/12515.aspx"&gt;how to add guidelines to Visual Studio&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I railed against people who create &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/07/28/13549.aspx"&gt;XML via string concatenation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I became a &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/08/23/14295.aspx"&gt;whore for rent&lt;/a&gt;. You should see the Google searches &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; post gets. :)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found out I'm in good company when &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/09/01/14452.aspx"&gt;I feel a bit overwhelmed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My daughter's first birthday! Yikes! How did &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; happen so fast? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I discovered &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/10/11/15424.aspx"&gt;the wonder of System.Collections.ObjectModel&lt;/a&gt;. I use this namespace more and more now. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/11/27/17134.aspx"&gt;was not a great month&lt;/a&gt;. Could have been worse, though. A lot worse. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ran into &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/11/02/16155.aspx"&gt;this problem&lt;/a&gt;, which would have bitten me several times since if I hadn't gotten help from one of my smarter (specifically: smarter than me) friends. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempted to catch up after the disaster that was November. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Released &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/12/02/17258.aspx"&gt;another new version of FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figured out &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/12/15/17482.aspx"&gt;how to use a hand-rolled WSDL&lt;/a&gt; with ASP.NET web services. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>17765</id><published>2005-12-31T07:38:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-12-31T07:38:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">2005 Highlights</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="17761"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>18053</id><published>2006-01-16T07:27:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-01-16T07:27:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">WebDev.WebServer.exe PathInfo Limitation </title><content type="html">&lt;div&gt;I've been interested lately in hosting the ASP.NET runtime. I'll have more to say about it later, but I've got a bunch of experiments I need to run first. One of them I just ran now, and the results were rather disappointing. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The easiest way to host the ASP.NET runtime is to use the Visual Studio 2005 web host executable, webdev.webserver.exe. This is the EXE that launches when you hit F5 on a web project in VS2005. You can also run it by hand by doing something like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;webdev.webserver /port:8080 /path:C:\temp\mywebapp /vpath:/mywebapp&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;For the most part, it works well, and I've used it successfully on one production project already. One thing it doesn't do, though, is to deal correctly with the "extra" bits after the end of extended URLs. For example, in &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt;, we have URLs like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki/HomePage.html"&gt;http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki/HomePage.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The reason the URLs look like this is a long and complicated story. But the deal here is that the page that gets executed is default.aspx, and anything that comes after that indicates the particular wiki topic that should be rendered. You can retrieve this extra part via ASP.NET's Request.PathInfo. Unfortunately, webdev.webserver.exe does not deal correctly with paths of this form. It appears to want there to be a file at "C:\whatever\base\directory\default.aspx\FlexWiki\HomePage.html" that actually exists on disk. D'oh!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Fortunately, I think I can fix this. But first I need to run some more experiments. :)&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>18057</id><published>2006-01-16T11:00:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-01-16T11:00:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: WebDev.WebServer.exe PathInfo Limitation </title><content type="html">Alternatively you could try my WebDev.WebServer2 implementation.

And in particular, I've been looking into Service Broker. From the little research I've done so far, it seems quite exciting: a real queuing system that's integrated right into the database. One of the problems I've always had with MSMQ is that it tends to smear out your application state between a database and the opaque message store. After all, a queue is basically just a database table with some special "triggers" attached to it that move the row to another table. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;At any rate, after doing a bunch of reading, I sat down to actually use the thing. I was hoping that it would be slam-dunk simple, but I hit a few roadblocks. I'm not ready yet to say whether that means SB is difficult to use, but I thought I'd document my problems (and the solutions) here in case anyone else runs into them. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The first problem I ran into was that the database needs a master encryption key. That is, in the database where my queues were set up, I needed to run this statement: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;create&lt;font size="2"&gt; master &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;key&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; encryption &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;by&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; password &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#808080"&gt;=&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#ff0000"&gt;'my lame-ass password'&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Before I did that, I wasn't seeing anything at all in either my source or my destination queues when sending a message. I was able to track the problem down with the help of Service Broker guru &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dan/"&gt;Dan Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;. He told me to run &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;select&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#808080"&gt;*&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#0000ff"&gt;from&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#008000"&gt;sys.transmission_queue&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;and sure enough, there was an error there that read&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The session keys for this conversation could not be created or accessed. The database master key is required for this operation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;which made it pretty obvious what the problem was. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Of course, that wasn't my last problem, but I'll save those for other posts. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>19006</id><published>2006-02-23T06:44:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-02-23T06:44:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">SQL Server Service Broker Newbie Problems - Part II</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="19004"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>19044</id><published>2006-02-23T10:54:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-02-23T10:54:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: SQL Server Service Broker Newbie Problems - Part I</title><content type="html">You'll probably hit a few more issues before you get it working for real (as in deliver a message remotely).

Here's how I was setting things up: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;create queue &lt;font color="#000000"&gt;mysenderqueue &lt;/font&gt;with &lt;/font&gt;status&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt; = ON;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;create queue &lt;/font&gt;myreceiverqueue&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt; with &lt;/font&gt;status&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt; = ON;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;create service &lt;/font&gt;mysenderservice&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt; on queue &lt;/font&gt;mysenderqueue&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;create service &lt;/font&gt;myreceiverservice&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt; on queue &lt;/font&gt;myreceiverqueue&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;declare &lt;/font&gt;@dialog_handle&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt; uniqueidentifier&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;begin dialog conversation &lt;/font&gt;@dialog_handle &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;from service &lt;/font&gt;mysenderservice&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt; to service &lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;'myreceiverservice'&lt;/font&gt;;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;send on conversation &lt;/font&gt;@dialog_handle &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;(&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;'This is a message'&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;);&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Those of you that know Service Broker will already have spotted the problem. It took me a little longer. :P &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The symptoms here are what were so confusing to me. After running the above SQL, if I did a &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;select &lt;font color="#808080"&gt;*&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;from&lt;/font&gt; mysenderqueue&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;select &lt;font color="#808080"&gt;*&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;from&lt;/font&gt; myreceiverqueue&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'd see that there were no messages in receiverqueue, but &lt;strong&gt;senderqueue&lt;/strong&gt; had one. WTF? Why didn't my message go to the right queue? &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;With the help of the inestimable &lt;a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/bobb/"&gt;Bob Beauchemin&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to figure out that what I &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; have been doing was this instead: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;select &lt;font color="#ff00ff"&gt;cast&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#808080"&gt;(&lt;/font&gt;message_body&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;as&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;XML&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#808080"&gt;)&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;from&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;mysenderqueue&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;If I had, I would have seen that the message in senderqueue actually said&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;lt;Error xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/SQL/ServiceBroker/Error"&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &amp;lt;Code&amp;gt;-8425&amp;lt;/Code&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &amp;lt;Description&amp;gt;The service contract 'DEFAULT' is not found.&amp;lt;/Description&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;lt;/Error&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So really, it wasn't that my message was going to the wrong queue, it was that Service Broker was bouncing my message and queuing an error back to the originating service. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Now, I was still confused, because this seems to imply that the DEFAULT contract isn't defined, when I can clearly see that it is via SQL Server Management Studio. A bit more digging revealed the following line in the docs for CREATE SERVICE: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;"If no contracts are specified, the service may only initiate conversations."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;While surprising (why name a contract DEFAULT if it's not the default?) this certainly was consistent with what I was seeing. Once I changed my service definition for the receiver service to be &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;create &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;service&lt;/font&gt; myreceiverservice &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;on&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;queue&lt;/font&gt; myreceiverqueue &lt;font color="#808080"&gt;(&lt;/font&gt; [DEFAULT] &lt;font color="#808080"&gt;);&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;then everything started working. Cool!

&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;ALTER DATABASE foo SET NEW_BROKER&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This will end any open conversations with an error and create a new broker in the database. Note, however, that it does not drop any queues or services that you may have defined, although it will empty your queues. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I could be missing some important side effect of this command, of course: I'm still trying to figure this stuff out. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>20870</id><published>2006-03-29T06:24:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-03-29T06:24:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">The Definition of &amp;amp;quot;Architecture&amp;amp;quot;</title><content type="html">&lt;div&gt;I came across &lt;a href="http://blogs.technet.com/michael_platt/archive/2006/03/27/423300.aspx"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Platt the other day. It's about the definition of the term "architecture", which is something I've been thinking about a lot recently (due to the fact that I'm writing a class for Pluralsight with the word "architecture" in the title). &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Here's the thing: Years ago, I used to have the title "system architect", but I don't think I could have told you what "architecture" means. In fact, I don't think I could have told you clearly what it meant if you asked me last month. The closest I could have gotten was probably "what architects do". And with all respect to Mr. Platt, his definition: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Architecture is the use of abstractions and models to simplify and communicate complex structures and processes to improve understanding and forecasting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;doesn't really do it for me either. Is it really an architect's job exclusively to forecast and communicate? That doesn't sound like a complete or accurate description of what I do when I act as the architect on a project. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It was conversations with my friends &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/tewald"&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt; and Jeff that really cleared it up for me. They pointed a couple of things out to me. First of all, only software architects talk about "an architecture". Architects that build buildings talk about a &lt;strong&gt;design&lt;/strong&gt;. This really resonates with me - I've always felt uncomfortable with the question "What's your architecture?" - I don't think that's a meaningful thing to ask. Whereas the question "What's your design?" seems far more straightforward and utilitarian. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So that goes straight to the question, "What should a software architect do?" It now seems fairly obvious to me that the answer is "Design software". Hopefully, these designs are based on the users' requirements - sussing out what those requirements are and turning them into a design is what distinguishes a good architect from a bad one. As is having an intimate knowledge of the technologies involved - good software architects should be reasonably good coders the same way good physical architects should know the properties of drywall and steel! Of course, neither can work in a vacuum, and both should rely on practitioners to verify and enhance the design against real-world constraints. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I think there's also another legitimate activity for someone that calls themselves an architect to perform. It involves the distinction between "architecture" and "Enterprise Architecture". The latter term has been so abused as to have nearly lost its meaning, but nevertheless I think it serves as well as any term we have right now as a description of an important activity; namely, that of setting up a framework within which architects can create maximally useful designs. Allow me to elaborate. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In "real world" construction (i.e. the construction of physical buildings), there are both architects and city planners. City planners do things like set up building codes, lay out key pieces of infrastructure, and check for conformance to rules. I believe that "Enterprise architects" should play a similar role in organizations where the resulting consistency is beneficial. We probably need a better name for this role, but Enterprise Architect serves well enough for now. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It seems strange that it has taken me something like ten years to understand this distinction well enough to be able to put it into words. But I feel better for having done so - as I said, I've always felt uncomfortable when people start slinging around the a-word; I guess I've just encountered too many people sporting the title "architect" who were useless, Ivory Tower, overengineering types. But with the analogy to real-world architecture clearer in my head, I can finally easily distinguish between productive and unproductive architectural activities. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'm sure I'm not the first to arrive here, but based on the massive fog around terms like "architecture", "architect", and "enterprise architecture", I can't imagine I'll be the last, either. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>20874</id><published>2006-03-29T07:52:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-03-29T07:52:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: The Definition of &amp;amp;quot;Architecture&amp;amp;quot;</title><content type="html">The best definitions I have found come from the Architects of buildings.

I agree also that architecture is a much abused title, viz the job adverts for 'Enterprise Architect', hands on Excel $35K.  However, I do see a clear distinction between software architecture and design so let me see whether I can express this in english!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;There is a vaguely useful definition of an architecture used in ANSI/IEEE Std 1471-2000: “the fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution”.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;However, by this definition everything has an architecture of sorts, either good or arbitrary, so far more useful is the question of why do you want (a good) one?  It really boils down to two things, you have an architecture to minimise the complexity of a system(&amp;amp; organization) and/or to facilitate growth and change.  The two are not always compatible (unless of course you have an abstract flexible architecture factory factory).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So for roles, the enterprise architect will try to optimise complexity/change decisions across a business while a solutions architect will do the same across a large development or a system.  Its more about setting the decision framework for software design rather than designing the software itself.  The role of the software designer is to implement business function, balancing the express business functional requirements with the architectural direction from the next level up. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So for me the important distinction is in what each of the roles is trying to acheive rather than the exact title.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="20870"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>20880</id><published>2006-03-30T03:09:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-03-30T03:09:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Interesting Finds</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="20870"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>20906</id><published>2006-03-31T19:12:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-03-31T19:12:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Link Listing - March 31, 2006</title><content type="html">AnkhSVN and a Monad SVN Provider?

Including me. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Responses to &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2006/03/29/20870.aspx"&gt;my post&lt;/a&gt; included comments from quite a few people - some private, some as comments on the blog post. Everyone seemed to have an opinion of what an architect does or what architecture means, although I don't think anyone actually contradicted my main (and, I guess, poorly-expressed) point: that the term "architecture" is very poorly understood. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;What was interesting was that everyone seemed to agree that (a) one of an architect's responsibilities is design, and that (b) the key to being a good architect is having a solid connection with both the technologies involved and the customer. (In fact, &lt;a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/"&gt;Martin Fowler&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/BuildingArchitect.html"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; how this is exactly the role an architect should take in building construction. And often doesn't.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.technet.com/michael_platt/"&gt;Michael Platt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://blogs.technet.com/michael_platt/archive/2006/03/29/423536.aspx"&gt;breaks it down&lt;/a&gt; into seven (!) overlapping roles. I'm not denying that the project-management aspects of Michael's breakdown are important functions, but that seems to fall well outside the realm of software, since it would be true of any project of sufficient size of any type. Also, I should point out that I never meant to imply that I thought Michael's definition was &lt;em&gt;wrong &lt;/em&gt;or that it somehow missed the point; just that it didn't increase my understanding of anything. Or, to put it another way, I'm still too stupid about exactly what "architecture" means to gain much from the fine points he put on it. :)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I think the main truths (such as they are) are this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol type="1" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nontrivial software needs a design. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a need for meta-design in larger organizations to constrain software designs to have commonality where this makes sense. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;My only point was that I think "architecture" has come to mean both things. I think this makes it rather useless as a term, because the two are so different. But with these two things finally separate in my head, lots of other stuff makes more sense to me now. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>23606</id><published>2006-05-15T12:30:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-05-15T12:30:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: The Great Thing About the Definition of &amp;amp;quot;Architecture&amp;amp;quot;</title><content type="html">Stop linking the profession Architecture with IT professions.

Thanks &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/tewald"&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;You might recall that a while back, I posted &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/04/27/7786.aspx"&gt;my views about the whole "contract first" or "code first"&lt;/a&gt; debate. I'm not here to stir that debate again, but to relate a story from the trenches that reinforced my opinion. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;Recently, I've been doing some work for a client that involved writing a web service under ASP.NET. For a variety of good reasons, we couldn't go the easy route of letting the system generate our WSDL for us. Instead, we wrote it by hand, and used &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/12/15/17482.aspx"&gt;this technique&lt;/a&gt; to make it show up in the right place. It was definitely harder than just writing a bunch of types, but I was pretty pleased with the result in the end. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;Then I made the mistake of taking a shower while thinking about the code. I should know better, having had too many good ideas while standing naked under hot water. (I will now pause to give you a moment to poke out your mind's eye.) What I realized made me want to yell "Stop the presses!" and indeed will likely delay the release of said web service. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;The issue, in a nutshell, is this: when writing custom WSDL, it's very, very easy to produce schema-invalid responses, &lt;strong&gt;unless&lt;/strong&gt; you implement IXmlSerializable on all your return types. The problem is one of ordering. Allow me to explain.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;One of the nice things about XmlSerializer is that it doesn’t really care about order. Let's say you have a class that looks like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;public class Person {&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;  public string Name; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;  public int Age; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;It doesn't really matter whether you deserialize this from XML that looks like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&amp;lt;Person&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;  &amp;lt;Name&amp;gt;Craig&amp;lt;/Name&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;  &amp;lt;Age&amp;gt;34&amp;lt;/Age&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&amp;lt;/Person&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;or this&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&amp;lt;Person&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;  &amp;lt;Age&amp;gt;34&amp;lt;/Age&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;  &amp;lt;Name&amp;gt;Craig&amp;lt;/Name&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&amp;lt;/Person&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;In the end, XmlSerializer will happily work with either flavor. And 99.99% of the time, this is fine, because you don't care. The problem arises because the schema that corresponds to this looks something like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&amp;lt;xs:element name="Person"&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;   &amp;lt;xs:complexType&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;    &amp;lt;xs:sequence&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;      &amp;lt;xs:element name="Name" type="xs:string" /&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;      &amp;lt;xs:element name="Age" type="xs:int" /&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;    &amp;lt;/xs:sequence&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;   &amp;lt;/xs:complexType&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&amp;lt;/xs:element&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;Note that this uses a &lt;strong&gt;sequence&lt;/strong&gt;, which means, "These elements must appear &lt;strong&gt;in this order&lt;/strong&gt;." No big deal if the Person type is an input to our WebMethod, because we probably don't care in the code which one came first. But if Person is the return type of a WebMethod, then we've got trouble. Because if I ever saw that Person class, I'd rewrite it like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;public class Person {&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;  public int Age; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;  public string Name; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;because I generally organize my files with members arranged alphabetically within visibility and member type groups. (Why? It makes it a snap to navigate the file in outline mode in VS.) But if I make that change and then serialize this type, it's going to serialize with the &amp;lt;Age&amp;gt; element first, and that's a schema violation. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;If all your clients use .NET, or other tools that don't care about order, great. But I think producing schema-invalid messages is just plain wrong, and likely to lead to hard-to-diagnose issues down the road as the tools evolve and your client base expands. Not to mention that if one of your clients tries to schema-validate, they're going to get an error. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;In short, writing web services that are fragile with respect to the order you define your members in your source code is a recipe for disaster. It's way too easy for someone to come along and make this sort of change. Of course, I think it's generally a bad idea to expose your domain entities directly via web services anyway, but even if you have the sort of serialization layer that avoids this problem, you still might get bit by this. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;And for our system, the problem was even worse. We'd written the schema ourselves rather than letting the system generate it, so either we had to change the schema to match the serialization patterns of our types, or we had to change the serialization to match the schema. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;Between these two choices, I believe the only realistic one is the latter. For one thing, you may not control the relevant parts of the schema…we didn't in the system I was working on. For another, there's no guarantee that Reflection (which the XmlSerializer relies on) will always return type members in the same order. It does now, and it would break a &lt;strong&gt;ton &lt;/strong&gt;of things horribly if they ever did change it, but all the same the order is not documented nor guaranteed to remain stable version-over-version. But the real reason is the one I already mentioned: you just simply shouldn't have to rely on the order of properties and fields in a source file to produce a correct system. Too fragile. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;Given that the only realistic choice is to change the serialization, how do we go about it? Well, if you're developing for .NET 1.1 you have to implement IXmlSerializable, the interface that gives you full control of the serialization process. And that's usually a pretty reasonable choice: hand-generating XML via XmlWriter is pretty straightforward, if a little tedious. You can punt the implementation of ReadXml (which is usually much harder) if the type is only used as a return value from your WebMethods (as opposed to being an input), since ReadXml will never be called in this case.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;If, on the other hand, you're working with .NET 2.0, you can make use of the Order property on XmlElementAttribute, like so: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;public class Person {&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;  [XmlElement(Order=2)] public int Age; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;  [XmlElement(Order=1)] public string Name; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;If I had to boil all this down to a set of rules, it would be these: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol type="1" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;Don't serialize your domain objects directly. Use a separate set of serialization types. This is just a general best practice. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider&lt;/strong&gt; implementing IXmlSerializable/XmlElementAttribute.Order on &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; WebMethod return types. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;You &lt;strong&gt;really, really should&lt;/strong&gt; implement IXmlSerializable/XmlElementAttribute.Order on WebMethod return types when you write the WSDL yourself. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;All this just goes to show that you have to code "&lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/04/27/7786.aspx"&gt;both first&lt;/a&gt;" - it is perilous to ignore either the XML or the tools.

&lt;br /&gt;Another possibility that could be applied in simple situations is use &amp;lt;xs:all&amp;gt; sections in your WSDL's XSD instead of &amp;lt;xs:sequence&amp;gt; - this allows the elements to appear in any order.
&lt;br /&gt;

We're calling it &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; 2.0, and not coincidentally, it involves an upgrade to .NET/ASP.NET 2.0. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I've been working on it for what feels like a loooong time, and for various reasons (some good, some less so) I hadn't checked in until today. Well, today I checked in the code - woohoo! So now we have two branches in CVS, which will make life ever so slightly more complicated, but which will allow me to sleep better at night. I do nightly backups of all my data, but that's not really the same as having it under version control at SourceForge. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;This partial rewrite was driven by the desire to give &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; a better authorization model. I still haven't even started on that part of it - first I had to untangle the existing caching code from the storage engine, and separate out a bunch of special processing that deals with something called "backing topics". Don't ask. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;Anyway, what I've got now is a much cleaner, more extensible design than what was there before. Of course, I still have to do performance testing once I finish coding the new security and caching features, and that will almost certainly drive some complexity back into the design. But I remain hopeful that the design will enable future work to be done without the sort of elbow-length-gloved-colonoscopy type of overhaul I did this time around. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In October, I started tracking the time I've put into developing this new version of &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt;. So far I'm at 75 hours, which is either a lot or not much depending on how you look at it. There's a lot left to do - the source in its current state doesn't even compile - but the main refactoring I was doing has unit tests that cover 94% of the class, so I've got a solid start. My to-do list activities include: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting the build reconfigured to deal with two branches. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting a build for the 2.0 code working. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few more minor refactorings. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-implementing support for built-in topics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing security support. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-implementing caching. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establishing some sort of performance testing regimen. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation, cleanup, and generally making sure it works after everything else I've done. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking some sort of serious break from working on &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt;. :) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Anyway, today was a major milestone for me, so I thought I'd share. If anyone has any comments on the code or the design, I'd love to hear them. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>22943</id><published>2006-05-04T06:34:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-05-04T06:34:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">FlexWiki 2.0</title><content type="html">This happened quite a while back now and even more progress has been made, but I still think it's worth...</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="21726"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>37930</id><published>2006-09-15T03:51:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-09-15T03:51:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">FlexWiki 2.0</title><content type="html">This happened quite a while back now and even more progress has been made, but I still think it's worth</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="21726"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>42154</id><published>2006-11-14T06:52:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-11-14T06:52:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: FlexWiki 2.0 Progress - The Big Commit</title><content type="html">While the new 2.0 version is still alpha, can later builds of the previous version be made available?

I think not</title><content type="html">&lt;div&gt;It's good to see &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/tewald"&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt; blogging again. Hopefully he'll keep it up this time (nudge, nudge, Tim). At any rate, I'll blame his lack of practice for his post "&lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/archive/2006/04/14/21730.aspx "&gt;Craig urges overkill, XmlSerializer sky not falling&lt;/a&gt;". Either that, or he had a high temperature/blood alcohol level. :)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Tim writes: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-LEFT: 50px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Craig got caught in a very particular set of circumstances. First, he started with WSDL. Then he hand-wrote his serializable types. Then he followed his preferred set of rules for ordering members of those types alphabetically.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The implication here is that unless you're doing all those things, you won't have the issues I describe in &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2006/04/06/21176.aspx"&gt;my post&lt;/a&gt;. This is simply not true. The problem I describe is an issue for anyone who does not explicitly control the order of serialization of their web service-visible types. Period. While I wouldn't exactly say the sky is falling, this is definitely a Big Deal. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I think the reason you don't see this occurring as a problem more often in the wild is that people tend to write .NET clients for their .NET web services, and XmlSerializer doesn't care about order. Or, more generally, schema validity. But if reach is important to your web service, &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; should. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I actually talked with Tim about this on the phone, and it came out during the conversation that the problem is even worse than I first thought. I had detected the issue with return types, but the fact of the matter is that if you reorder your type members for either input or output parameters, you change the generated schema in the WSDL. And that's a breaking change (from a schema standpoint). &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Which really was my whole point: you need to be EXCEEDINGLY careful with your types unless you implement IXmlSerializable or use XmlElementAttribute.Order. Reordering type members is just too easy for a developer to do without thinking about it, and isn't the sort of thing that's easy to catch as critical even if your team reviews all source changes. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As Tim points out, implementing the read side of IXmlSerializable is a royal pain most of the time (you'll note I only said "consider" using it), but XmlElementAttribute.Order is pretty easy. Of course, it's only available in .NET 2.0. :p &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>21938</id><published>2006-04-18T06:52:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-04-18T06:52:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Overkill? I think not</title><content type="html">I implemented a server-side specification for EPC/RFID called ALE and it includes a WSDL/XSD for the service communication mechanism. I used their WSDL/XSD (made by Java guys in a Java-friendly manner) and used wsdl.exe to generated the server side stubs and serializable classes (.NET 1.1) and the element ordering was a huge sticking point. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;No matter what order I put the properties on my types in they wouldn't serialize in the correct order (it used sequence instead of any). I considered IXmlSerializable at the time but .NET 2.0 hadn't beta'd yet and it is marked as do not use in 1.1 and we didn't want to risk having to redo our implementation so we opted for using one of the SoapReceiver classes in WSE and format the messages ourselves.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Your previous article focuses on return types but never focuses on input types, which I think is much more of a PITA.

And you're right again when you point out that the read part of XmlSerializer is much more painful than the write part. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;One trick I considered implementing was to use an XmlSerializable nested class for the read, calling Deserialize on it in my implementation of IXmlSerializable.ReadXml, then just copying out any relevant data.

I think not</title><content type="html">That would be an annoying duplication of a ton of classes/properties in my case, but definitely an option. The only thing I'm curious about is how it would all work with Bare-style element passing:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;On the class itself:
&lt;br /&gt;[System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapDocumentService( RoutingStyle=SoapServiceRoutingStyle.RequestElement )]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;On the method:
&lt;br /&gt;[System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapDocumentMethodAttribute( Use=System.Web.Services.Description.SoapBindingUse.Literal, ParameterStyle=System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapParameterStyle.Bare)]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;These are both required for the service I implemented. The routing style because the WSDL does not specify a SOAPAction, and Bare parameter style because there's no need to wrap the parameters in a wrapper Request object since the WSDL already defines that. Then consider that I have the same type used as the parameter for multiple methods and you end up with multiple root element names defining the same type.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;It's been so long I've had to work with it, I don't remember how the XmlSerializer handles that. Three types or just keep the XmlType/XmlRoot attribute off the type or will it just read the root element and assume you know what you're doing?</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="21933"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>21961</id><published>2006-04-18T12:30:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-04-18T12:30:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">The great WSDL debate</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="21933"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>21963</id><published>2006-04-18T12:39:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-04-18T12:39:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Overkill?

&lt;br /&gt;Can you provide more information on the problem you had with ordering? I've just never seen this in the wild, so I'm curious.

&lt;br /&gt;The XmlSerializer issue is only related to doc/lit/bare services in as much as you're using the serializer to create the "verb" wrapper element (if you have one).

&lt;br /&gt;My point about Bare parameter style is only in regard to Craig's previous comment on using a serializable nested class, and I was point out that I wasn't sure what would happen to the XmlSerializer if you give it a single type but send an XmlReader at different element names (so multiple root element names can represent the same type).</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="21933"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>22060</id><published>2006-04-19T05:54:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-04-19T05:54:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">The Perils of WSDL First (Again)</title><content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/tewald"&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/aaron"&gt;Aaron&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/aaron/archive/2006/04/18/21944.aspx"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/aaron/archive/2006/04/18/21950.aspx"&gt;pitched&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/archive/2006/04/14/21730.aspx"&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/archive/2006/04/18/21964.aspx"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; this &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2006/04/06/21176.aspx"&gt;Perils of WSDL First&lt;/a&gt; thread. I just want to point out that I largely agree with what they are saying. Which is good, because disagreeing with either of them on matters pertaining to web services would be enough to make someone with even my huge ego question themselves! ;) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;They advocate use of an abstraction layer between your domain types and the XmlSerializable types you use as your web service paramaeters. This is a fantastic idea, and it's the way I write web services myself, having been bitten more than once by direct exposure of domain classes. Generally speaking, this will go a long way towards preventing the sort of problems I warn about in &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2006/04/06/21176.aspx"&gt;my original post&lt;/a&gt;. In many cases, it will even be sufficient, especially when coupled with Tim's idea of having the serializable types be in a separate assembly owned by someone who understands the implications of code changes on the wire protocol. And the DCS stuff that Aaron talks about looks like an excellent further step in the right direction. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So if I still appear skittish, it's because I know that most people don't program this way. Most people follow the path of least resistance, and will hesitate to implement writing the boring, repetitive mapping code involved in the most straightforward implementation of such an abstraction layer. Yes, I realize more sophisticated implementations are possible, but I'm talking here about people and organizations that don't necessarily recognize the long-term benefits of such a setup. As a consultant, I've seen this more than once. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The other thing that makes me a bit nervous is that even with an abstraction layer, you still have to be very careful not to muck with it &lt;strong&gt;in ways that would change the contract &lt;/strong&gt;- a fact that both Tim and Aaron are clearly aware of. This is obvious to people who've been doing web services for a while, but for a lot of developers the angle brackets are still invisible. Basically, I'm trying to point out that web service development needs to be &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/04/27/7786.aspx"&gt;both first&lt;/a&gt;. Fragile code sucks; the more things you have to remember, the more likely you are to make a mistake. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Whether or not any of this means your organization needs to go whole-hog and implement IXmlSerializable really depends on the dynamics of your development process. Probably you don't need to go that far, especially given XmlElementAttribute.Order. At the end of the day, just remember that when you let the infrastructure generate your XML automatically, seemingly innocuous changes in your code can create breaking changes in your wire protocol. Remember it, and use appropriate techniques to address the risk. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>22067</id><published>2006-04-19T06:15:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-04-19T06:15:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: The Perils of WSDL First (Again)</title><content type="html">This seems like a good argument for better tooling.

A common, and fairly natural way of handling this is with a combination of the Service Gateway and Assembler patterns. This is essentially the same problem that's been kicking around for quite awhile: you don't want to couple your domain model to a data contract. See Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture by Fowler for more on some of these patterns.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Spring.NET has started to do some rough groundwork on an implementation of these patterns for web services. You might want to check out the work that they are doing. It builds on top of standard ASP.NET web services and interoperates with WSE and WCF.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="22060"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>22113</id><published>2006-04-19T12:36:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-04-19T12:36:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: The Perils of WSDL First (Again)</title><content type="html">Craig,
&lt;br /&gt;You do provide that! However, your posts aren't yet popping up in the Dynamic Help window in VS2005. Perhaps you should use your influence.

&lt;br /&gt;In my mind, instead of what I actually wrote, I was thinking more of Guidance Automation (I am finding 'Software Factories' fascinating, but I have a nagging suspicion that there is at least one more as yet unknown huge hurdle to clear).

&lt;div&gt;  One, &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Note the "extra" comma after the last element. I thought to myself, "There's no way this can compile." But in fact it does, and when I stopped to think about it, I realized how nice this C# feature is. It means I can more easily reorder these elements, more easily generate source code, and in general is just one less thing to worry about. And it turns out this works for static array declarations, too, like&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;string[] foo = { "a", "b", "c", }; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Well for reordering you can simply cut and paste lines - there's no need to remove the trailing comma on whatever enum happens to be last now, and there's no need to add a comma to whatever enum used to be last, but no longer is.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And for code generation, it's a bit of state that no longer needs to be tracked in whatever is generating the code - just always slap a comma at the end of the enum-list-item.  When the generated code is compiled, the compiler won't care if there's a 'dangling' comma at the end.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;These aren't earth shattering issues, but they are small plusses without any drawbacks (as far as I can see).</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="23008"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>23300</id><published>2006-05-11T14:32:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-05-11T14:32:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Trailing Commas</title><content type="html">This is OLD SKOOL C!!!

Don't take me wrong. I'm not exactly the guy who follows the rules but I have had nightmares when I got a bug on my code and you never expect that this little comma could be the reason of it.

Well, today we launched it at a TechEd chalk talk (DEVTLC03), so I can finally talk about it: the Microsoft/TechNet Publishing System (MTPS) Content Services. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In brief, the MTPS Content Services are a set of web services for exposing the content in MTPS. MTPS is the application I helped write a few years back that stores and processes all the content at &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/"&gt;MSDN2&lt;/a&gt;. With the web service, you now have programmatic access to all that data via SOAP. So if you want to embed access to the documentation for System.Xml.XmlTextReader into your application, go for it. If you want to know what the child nodes of System.DateTime.ToString() are in the table of contents, you can go and find that, too. I expect to see some fairly interesting uses of the service pop up in the near future. There's such a huge amount of good information in MTPS that I imagine lots of people will want to leverage it. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The web service is reasonably well-documented &lt;a href="http://services.msdn.microsoft.com/ContentServices/ContentService.asmx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (of course, I wrote the web service &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the documentation, so maybe I'm not the best person to judge the quality of the docs), but let me give a brief explanation of how it works. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The web service consists of two operations: GetContent and GetNavigationPaths. GetContent - as you might imagine - allows you to retrieve content (XHTML, GIFs, etc.) from MTPS. GetNavigationPaths lets you get the table of contents (TOC) data for the items in the system. I imagine most people will use GetContent far more often than GetNavigationPaths. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The system is organized around the concept of a &lt;em&gt;content item&lt;/em&gt;. A content item is a collection of &lt;em&gt;documents&lt;/em&gt; identified collectively by a &lt;em&gt;content key&lt;/em&gt;. A document has a &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;em&gt;format&lt;/em&gt;, and some content. The document most people will probably be interested in is the document of type primary, format Mtps.Xhtml, but there are other documents associated with a content item as well (for example, images can be stored in the content item as well). See the docs for more detail. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A content key consists of three parts: a &lt;em&gt;content identifier&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;em&gt;locale&lt;/em&gt;, and a &lt;em&gt;version&lt;/em&gt;. The locale is something like en-us (US English) or de-de (German as they speak it in Germany). The version is something like SQL.90 (SQL Server 2005). &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The content identifier is a bit more complicated. It can be one of five things: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol type="1" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;short ID&lt;/em&gt;. This is an eight-character identifier like "ms123401". &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;content alias&lt;/em&gt;. This is a "friendly name" for the content item, like "System.Xml.XmlTextReader".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;content GUID&lt;/em&gt;. Topics can also be identified by a GUID. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;content URL&lt;/em&gt;. To allow for easy integration with the HTML front end of MTPS URLs like &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b8a5e1s5(VS.80).aspx"&gt;http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b8a5e1s5(VS.80).aspx&lt;/a&gt; can also be used to identify a content item. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An &lt;em&gt;asset ID&lt;/em&gt;. This is how topics are identified internally by the system, and they occasionally appear in the output. They always begin with "AssetId:".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;With the exception of asset IDs, these are all the same pieces that you can already use in the URLs for MSDN2, so the concepts should be familiar if you've spent any time looking at that stuff. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There are two slightly funky (but highly intentional) things about what GetContent returns that you'll need to keep in mind. The first is that, by default, the body of the documents that make up a content are not returned. Unless you list a document in the &lt;em&gt;requestedDocuments&lt;/em&gt; section of the request message, you'll just get the types and formats of the available documents. This is because documents can be quite large, and it would be a waste to transmit all of them every time. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The other thing to be aware of is the idea of available versions and locales. If you send in a request for content item ms123401, locale en-us, version MSDN.10, you'll get back that content item, but you'll also receive a list that will tell you that the content item is also available for locale/version fr-fr/MSDN.10 and locale/version en-us/MSDN.20. This list is particularly valuable when the content key you request does not correspond to a known content item - in that case it represents the best guess by the MTPS system for reasonable alternatives. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;GetNavigationPaths has a few twists as well. First, there's the name. We seriously considered calling it GetToc, but it's not &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; TOC data, since it's used for other things, like that little trail of links (sometimes called "breadcrumbs" or the "eyebrow") at the top of MSDN2 pages. What it really returns is all the ways to navigate between two content items. Hence, GetNavigationPaths. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;GetNavigationPaths accepts two content keys. In this case, the identifier in the keys must be a short ID. (If you need to, you can resolve a short ID from an alias, a GUID, a URL or an asset ID via a call to GetContent first.) The first key identifies the &lt;em&gt;root&lt;/em&gt;, which is the content item you'd like to start at, and second key identifies the &lt;em&gt;target&lt;/em&gt;, which is the content item you'd like to wind up on. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;What you get back is a list of &lt;em&gt;navigation paths &lt;/em&gt;between the root and the target. There might be more than one path, because a content item can appear in more than one place in the TOC. A navigation path is a list of &lt;em&gt;navigation nodes&lt;/em&gt;, where each navigation node is made up of a &lt;em&gt;title&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;em&gt;navigation node key&lt;/em&gt;, and a &lt;em&gt;content node key.&lt;/em&gt; There's also some information about something called phantoms, but I'll defer that to the docs. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The title is fairly self-explanatory, but the distinction between a navigation node key and a content node key is somewhat less intuitive…I had to have it explained to me more than a few times when I was writing the system. Basically, it arises out of the fact that every node in the TOC is itself a separate content item in the system, whose content consists of a reference to the content item that TOC node represents and a list of child nodes. So the navigation node key is a content key (identifier plus version plus locale) that represents the TOC node itself, and the content node key identifies the content item the TOC node corresponds to. You can tell the difference between the two because the content item identified by the navigation node key will always have a primary document of format "Mtps.Toc". &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Another way to look at it is that the navigation node key tells you where you are in the left hand tree of MSDN2, and the content node key tells you what goes in the right hand content pane. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Like I said, I don't expect as many people to use GetNavigationPaths as to use GetContent, so I wouldn't lose too much sleep over the details. Of course, if you &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; wind up using it (or any part of the system), I'd love to hear about it, or about how we could make it or the documentation better. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This was a very interesting system to write for a variety of reasons, but I think I'll save the "how" for another post. I've also got what I think is a pretty cool application of the service that (at least some) people are really going to like. More on that later, too. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We consider the system to be roughly in beta, as we already know several things we need to improve or change. That said, we feel good enough about it to turn the world loose on it. If you come up with any cool ideas about how to use the service, or ideas about how we could improve it, drop a comment here. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>38</thr:total></entry><entry><id>27286</id><published>2006-06-12T09:47:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-06-12T09:47:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Announcing the MTPS Content Service</title><content type="html">"The web service is reasonably well-documented here": The link is not accessible.

And we did - every time you hit F1 in Visual Studio 2005, you're accessing the MTPS system. Now that &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2006/06/12/27273.aspx"&gt;the MTPS Content Service is publicly available&lt;/a&gt;, we expect other applications of the data to start popping up. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;To get the ball rolling, and because we always thought it would be cool, I've written the first one. I call it &lt;em&gt;msdnman&lt;/em&gt;, and users of *nix systems should find it fairly familiar: it's written as an analog of the &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt; command. The idea is to provide command-line access to the MTPS content. I'm a big command-line guy myself, so I really like the concept. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;For now, I've posted the binaries and source &lt;a href="http://wangdera.com/msdnman/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I'm working on getting it shoved over to SourceForge, but there are a few administrative hurdles to clear first, so it might take me a few weeks. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Because I wrote this in my spare time over a couple of days, it's still a bit rough. But it's still pretty servicable for those times where you don't want to fire up a browser, and I think it makes a reasonable demonstration of how to use the web service, too. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It's pretty straightfoward to use. Simply grab the binaries and run something like &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;msdnman System.Xml.XmlReader&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;in a console window, and you should see something like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="/craig/images/msdnmanscreenshot1.png" alt="msdnman screenshot" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There are a bunch of options that you can specify, too. You can get a list of them by running &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;msdnman -?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;but briefly, you'll generally either do this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;msdnman IDENTIFIER&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;or this&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;msdnman -k KEYWORD&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;where IDENTIFIER identifies some content item in the MTPS system. See &lt;a href="http://services.msdn.microsoft.com/ContentServices/ContentService.asmx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more information, but usually this will be the name of the namespace, class, method you're looking up, like System.Xml.XmlReader or System.Security.Cryptography. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The "-k" option is a nifty little add-on that I did (at the request of John Mollman - &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mollman/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is your blog, right?), which does a keyword search against the MSDN content. So you can do &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;msdnman -k web.config &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;to get back a list of links having something to do with web.config.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I implemented the search part by wiring up to the same web service that Visual Studio 2005 uses, as the MTPS web service does not currently support search. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So &lt;a href="http://wangdera.com/msdnman/"&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; and enjoy, and &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/craig/contact.aspx"&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt; if you have any ideas for how to improve it. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>28</thr:total></entry><entry><id>27292</id><published>2006-06-12T10:59:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-06-12T10:59:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">MSDN Content Web Services online...</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="27288"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>27294</id><published>2006-06-12T11:14:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-06-12T11:14:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">MSDN Content Web Services online...</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="27288"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>27300</id><published>2006-06-12T14:42:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-06-12T14:42:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Announcing msdnman</title><content type="html">Awesome, awesome, awesome.

&lt;br /&gt;Great. I think this is pretty much a must for people that aren't on en-us boxes. First time I tried it I thought the tool didn't work at all.

&lt;br /&gt;I just did that - works beautifully :-)

&lt;br /&gt;Well, it's not the - in -loc that's giving me problems, it's the one in "en-us". Seems somehow Powershell's command line parsing has trouble with that. Only way I could get it to work was by doing $loc="en-us";msdnman -loc $loc System.String

&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless this is a great tool for those of us who use the command line in development. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you have MSDN installed already, why does the MSDN2 final URN differ from the local URN
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;For example: Chr, ChrW functions
&lt;br /&gt;ms-help://MS.MSDNQTR.v80.en/MS.MSDN.v80/MS.VisualStudio.v80.en/dv_vbalr/html/37f3c707-8a6f-4c51-9b02-9e634c4299ab.htm
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;OR 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/613dxh46.aspx
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Or the real question is, will the MSDN subscription be made compatible with MSDN online and eventually carry the same URNs? In this way you could use the MSDNMAN with a local service if you do not have access to the Internet.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="27288"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>27422</id><published>2006-06-13T09:19:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-06-13T09:19:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Announcing msdnman</title><content type="html">The reason the two URLs differ is that MSDN2 was a rewrite of the content system at MSDN, and one of the big things we fixed was the URL scheme. The chm version of MSDN doesn't get generated from that system right now. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The problem you'd run into with trying to run against the local content is that it's not XHTML. We had to do a lot of scrubbing to get the XHTML even as clean as it is. A lot. Running a transform against straight HTML would be painful. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But you never know - maybe someone will get inspired and pull it off. Failing that, the web service would allow you to write a scraper that would pull all the content you care about into a local cache. I don't think I'll implement anything like this, but someone might.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="27288"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>27531</id><published>2006-06-13T12:56:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-06-13T12:56:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">MTPS ContentServices and MSDNMan</title><content type="html">Craig Andera has been working with my team on a set of web services exposing MSDN2 content hosted by...</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="27288"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>27534</id><published>2006-06-13T16:41:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-06-13T16:41:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">New and Notable 100!

I said I was going to move it to SourceForge, but &lt;a href="http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy/"&gt;Brad Wilson&lt;/a&gt; suggested that I host it at &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/"&gt;CodePlex&lt;/a&gt; instead. So I did: msdnman lives &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=msdnman"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; now. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;CodePlex is part Microsoft's answer to SourceForge, part spiritual successor to GotDotNet. As you know, &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/03/24/1271.aspx"&gt;I was pretty a pretty vocal detractor of GotDotNet&lt;/a&gt;, but that's exactly why I wanted to try out CodePlex - I wanted to see if Microsoft had gotten it right this time. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Well, I'd say they're on the right track. Having worked with CodePlex for all of two days now, I'm reasonably impressed. To start with, it has a real source control system - TFS. Aspects of the command-line support are slightly annoying (the need to constantly reauthenticate, specifically), but it's a totally modern tool, with support for lots of interesting and useful features (e.g. &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/w6y8ezzs.aspx"&gt;shelving&lt;/a&gt;). Other touches of the site - wiki editing for the project's home page, export of work items to Excel, linking checkins to work items, etc. - are really nice, and a step above what SourceForge provides. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;My only major complaint is that there's no email support on the site right now. I believe email to be the lifeblood of open source projects. It's certainly how I do everything. Right now CodePlex uses RSS, which I think will serve well enough until email is available (it's on their list). &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;All in all, CodePlex is a pretty good effort for a v1 release. I expect it will improve rapidly, too, given that they have people like Brad and &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jamesnewkirk/"&gt;Jim Newkirk&lt;/a&gt; (of NUnit fame) on the team. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>28435</id><published>2006-06-19T10:02:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-06-19T10:02:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Mixing Forms and Windows Authentication in ASP.NET 2.0</title><content type="html">&lt;div&gt;Almost two years ago, I &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/07/24/1699.aspx"&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; about how to mix Forms and Windows authentication in an ASP.NET application. It was something I figured out for a client, and they've been using the basic idea ever since. It worked pretty well up until a month or two ago. Then it broke pretty hard. What changed? We upgraded to ASP.NET 2.0. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Well, I finally got a chance to sit down and chase the problem, and I figured out what looks like a solution. We have yet to integrate my idea into the product, but I wrote a quick prototype, and it looks like it's going to work, so I thought I would blog it here. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The kernel of the problem is that the ASP.NET 2.0 Forms Authentication Module appears to stomp on the "Response.StatusCode = 401" that you need to set in order to make mixed authentication work. I'm not sure exactly where this happens: I got lost in Reflector when I tried to chase it down. But you can easily observe the effect - your login page will redirect back onto itself, with the ReturnUrl query string parameter double-escaped. That is, you'll see something like this in your address bar: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://andera/mixauth/login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fmixauth%2flogin.aspx%3fReturnUrl%3d%252fmixauth%252fDefault.aspx"&gt;http://andera/mixauth/login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fmixauth%2flogin.aspx%3fReturnUrl%3d%252fmixauth%252fDefault.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;instead of this&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://andera/mixauth/login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fmixauth%2fDefault.aspx"&gt;http://andera/mixauth/login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fmixauth%2fDefault.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Notice how the ReturnUrl is actually pointing back to the login page itself, rather than to Default.aspx the way it should be. Again, I haven't chased down exactly where this behavior is coming from, but it's easy enough to observe. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;My solution was simply to attach a handler to the Application's EndRequest event by putting the following in Global.asax: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;protected void Application_EndRequest(object sender, EventArgs e)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;{&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;    if (Context.Items["Send401"] != null)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;    { &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;         Response.StatusCode = 401;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;         Response.StatusDescription = "Unauthorized"; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;    } &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Then, in order to trigger this code, all I have to do is put a &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Context.Items["Send401"] = true; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;somewhere in my login page when I determine that I need redirection to pick up on the user's Windows credentials. Because Application_EndRequest runs much later in the page lifecycle than the code in my login page, Forms Authentication can't get in the way and screw up my status change. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I thought I'd try to be really clever and attach my handler in the page itself by doing something like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Context.ApplicationInstance.EndRequest += LoginPage_EndRequest; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;but it doesn't work. I'm not sure why (the page lifecycle is not my strong suit these days), and I'm out of time to chase it down.  If you happen to know what I'm doing wrong, drop a comment. In the meantime, the Global.asax thing works well enough for us.&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>19</thr:total></entry><entry><id>28485</id><published>2006-06-19T14:59:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-06-19T14:59:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Mixing Forms and Windows Authentication in ASP.NET 2.0</title><content type="html">AFAIK, you can't just hook into the ApplicationInstance events inside a page or other regular object.

Scott and I recently published an MSDN article along something similar, except we addressed the issue of running standard HTTP authentication (Basic/Digest) alongside Forms authentication on the same web application. You can find the article here:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnaspp/html/MADAM.asp?frame=true
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The supplied solution, called MADAM (Mixed Authentication Disposition ASP.NET Module), solves the problem in a similar fashion. That is, an HttpModule is installed that conditionally sets the status code to 401 so that the browser would pop its credentials dialog. The *condition* is entirely configurable as opposed to being hard-coded, so you can teach the puppy new tricks we didn't think of. :) I've done a mental walkthrough, so in theory, I can imagine how the supplied HttpModule (FormsAuthenticationDispositionModule) could help in your case as well.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="28435"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>32747</id><published>2006-08-01T00:48:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-08-01T00:48:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Mixing Forms and Windows Authentication in ASP.NET 2.0</title><content type="html">Hi Craig,

And even then I think it might only be IE that does that, not Firefox, although I could be wrong. 

Under IE, the test for the intranet zone is simple: if the server name does not contain a dot (e.g. foobar versus www.foobar.com), then you're in the intranet zone. 

So generally, it's not possible to get the "auto-login" effect from the Internet.

It was riddled with errors, and it crashed when I tried to edit a page, but the blasted thing actually showed me HTML that wasn't the ASP.NET error page…I practically peed myself. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As you may have read here before, I've been working on refactoring &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; for quite a while. I started tracking my hours in October of 2005, but I really started this effort a few months before that. I generally try to work on it every day, but the realities of work and family mean it's much less often than that. Still, I see I've put in over 100 hours on it. If nothing else, that makes me feel pretty good about having "paid" for all the open source software I use. :) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There's a metric boatload of things to be done before &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; 2.0 is ready to go, of course. I think my next few months will look something like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ol type="1" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix the 10,000 bugs I introduced. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a performance test suite to characterize the behavior of the application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the test suite. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze the results. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make improvements, including the caching provider that was part of the original reason for doing this massive refactorization. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goto 3 a lot of times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the security module that got me started on this hellroad. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goto 1 a lot of times. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goto 1 a lot of times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a break from &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe to work on FlexWikiPad. :) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Still, this really feels like turning a corner.

&lt;br /&gt;If you're looking to help out, one thing you can do right now is to download the new 2.0 bits from builds.flexwiki.com and hammer on them to find bugs (there are lots).

Fortunately &lt;a href="http://leastprivilege.com/"&gt;Dominick&lt;/a&gt; was able to straighten me out rather quickly. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;What I was trying to do was to update a build script to run off of a shared drive (don't ask). Of course, when running .NET code like NAnt and the other 90 tools we use in the build, you need to elevate privileges or your tools are unlikely to work with the decreased permissions they get by default when running from a network drive. That much I knew. Where I got burned was that some of our tools are compiled for .NET 1.1, and some for 2.0. Well, policy for 1.1 is completely separate from policy for 2.0. So I had to change it in both places. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Luckily, I didn't waste too much time on this. It helps to be willing to bother your friends. :) &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>32592</id><published>2006-07-27T08:14:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-07-27T08:14:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Getting CLR Security Right - Seeing Double</title><content type="html">It's pretty simple to change the policy to trust a network drive once you've dug through the documentation (which isn't necessarily as simple).

It was, in a word, excellent. Really, really good. And it's available in its entirety for free online. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I definitely learned a lot reading this book, despite having had a couple of years' experience helping to run &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; now. I was happy to see that we already follow many of his recommedations, but I also know I'll be changing a few things we do based on what I read. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Even setting aside the fantastic advice about how to set up the technical infrastructure, I found Mr. Fogel's insight into the culture of free/open source to be truly insightful. It's no wonder that Subversion rocks so hard with guys like this behind it. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I've learned that differs from the book is that the size and appeal of your project will affect how stringent your commit access requirements are.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If your project doesn't have wide appeal, then you may want to relax those requirements, but stay on top of reviewing commits.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="32644"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>35561</id><published>2006-08-24T06:02:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-08-24T06:02:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Console Text Selection Via the Keyboard</title><content type="html">&lt;div&gt;I was hanging out with some Pluralsight guys last weekend. &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dan/"&gt;Dan Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; was talking about SQL Service Broker, so I was already paying close attention, but then he did something that made me sit straight up my seat…he selected text in a console window using only the keyboard! &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I've said it many times before: I'm a keyboard kind of guy. So it has always bugged me when I have had to take my hands off the keyboard to select text in a console window. Well, now I don't have to any more. Maybe I'm the last guy to figure this out, but apparently when you go into mark mode in a console window, you can use the arrow keys to move the selection point, and shift-arrows to extend the selection. Way cool! &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Just to summarize, here's how I'd select some text in a console window, using only the keyboard: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Alt-Space, e, k  [Enter mark mode]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Down, down, down, right, right, right [Move the cursor]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Shift-right, shift-down, shift-right [Extend the selection]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Enter [Copy the selection to the clipboard]&lt;/div&gt;

I've been checking the website frequently to see when the new issue would be released, because I've got an article in it! You can read it &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/10/InsideMSDN/default.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It's the latest installment of "Inside MSDN", a column that talks about how the suite of applications and services that make up MSDN itself is built. My article covers how to use &lt;a href="http://services.msdn.microsoft.com/ContentServices/ContentService.asmx"&gt;the MTPS Content Service&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2006/06/12/27273.aspx"&gt;I announced here&lt;/a&gt; on CraigBlog a few months ago. &lt;/div&gt;

("What's COM+?" you say? Yeah, I feel the same way.) &lt;/div&gt;

Often, getting access to their VPN is difficult, like when the engagement is very short and the VPN red tape copious. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I've tried emailing zips, setting up a WebDAV share, and various other strategies, all of which had one shortcoming or other. The best solution is, of course, a source control system of some sort, but even that I've had problems with (e.g. the combination of the client's firewall and my ISP blocks the port(s) we need).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;For a couple of weeks now, I've been trying a new strategy. Using &lt;a href="http://www.foldershare.com/"&gt;FolderShare&lt;/a&gt;, we create a shared folder that we both have write access to. Then we turn it into a &lt;a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/"&gt;Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; repository. On each end, we pull from and push to this folder/repository, making it look a lot like a source control server. And so far, it works great. It even runs over HTTPS, which should make any suspicious sysadmins slightly happier. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I imagine one could do the same thing with CVS or Subversion [1], although I haven't tried it. Bazaar seemed like a reasonable choice for two reasons: a) it's more "folder-y" than most SCC systems, so it seemed like a natural fit, and b) &lt;a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/"&gt;Sam Ruby&lt;/a&gt; thinks it's cool, so I wanted to try it out. :) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;[1] You might even be able to make it work with SourceSafe. But then you'd have to use SourceSafe, and why would you use something that's both worse and more expensive? &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>38362</id><published>2006-09-20T04:54:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-09-20T04:54:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Announcing HoboCopy</title><content type="html">&lt;div&gt;For a while now, I've been unhappy with the state of my backup strategy. I have a simple script that runs ntbackup every night on a rotating, 14-day schedule: one full backup followed by six incremental backups, then repeat with a different target. In this way, I can always recover to any day in (at least) the last week. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So why am I unhappy? Two reasons: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol type="1" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ntbackup isn't exactly robust - I've seen all sorts of failures, and restoring files is sort of flaky. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ntbackup locks its information up in a proprietary format. I just want my files, dammit, not some .bks file. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Being a cheap bastard with decent programming skills, I started looking at what it would take to wire up my own solution. I thought about using &lt;a href="http://www.ss64.com/nt/robocopy.html"&gt;robocopy&lt;/a&gt;, the king of copy tools. But it has one major drawback: it can't copy any files that are locked by another program. Some of my friends solve this problem by shutting down all their programs every night, but I knew that there was no way I (or my wife) was going to remember to do that, and of course the one time I'd forget was the day my hard drive would tank. Plus, what about programs like SQL Server that I don't want to ever shut down? &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Obviously, it's possible to copy files that are in use. After all, ntbackup does it. So I started poking around, and came across VSS. The good VSS (Volume Shadow Service), not the unbelievably crappy one (Visual Source Safe). The Volume Shadow Service is a very cool piece of Windows XP/2003 that lets you "snapshot" a hard drive, creating what's essentially a point-in-time image of what's on the disk. You can then copy files from that image at your leisure. Better, it's done in an efficient manner, so that it doesn't actually copy anything unless someone does a write, and even then it only copies at a block level. Which is good, because otherwise you'd need 50GB free to snapshot 50GB of data. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;But it's even better than that. VSS includes an API that programs like SQL Server 2005 can use to find out when a snapshot is about to occur. When so notified, VSS-aware programs can flush their state to disk, so you get a consistent backup. Of course, not every program is aware of VSS. For those, you get what the docs call a "crash consistent" snapshot. Translation: whatever the hell was on the disk. In my book, that's still better than not backing up at all. After all, my computer seems to do just fine after a BSOD, which is no different.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Armed with the Platform SDK docs, I set out to achieve my goal of a VSS-based backup utility. I would have liked to have used robocopy to do the copy, but I couldn't get it to copy using source paths like \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\data\backup\SmtpSend\Properties\Resources.resx, &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;which how you get to the files in the snapshot. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Next, I tried to write a managed tool that would do the copy. That wouldn't have been too bad - recursive file copy is pretty simple to implement. Unfortunately, the VSS API is completely broken for CLR interop - the main object you need to access implements one COM interface,  IVssBackupComponents. But if you try to query that object for that interface, it returns E_NOINTERFACE. Which is &lt;strong&gt;wrong, wrong, wrong&lt;/strong&gt;. And also means that there's no way to use the object from straight managed code. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So I decided to write the tool in unmanaged C++. Maybe I could have done it in managed C++, or a combination of C++ and C#, but in the end I decided to make this a project that would help me get a little rust off my C++ skills. Plus, the documentation suggests that paths starting with \\?\GLOBALROOT aren't safe to use from managed code, although it worked fine when I tested it. The end result is &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig/HoboCopy.html"&gt;HoboCopy&lt;/a&gt;. You pass it a source directory and a destination directory, and it makes a recursive copy using VSS. I've run it against my entire hard drive, and it's able to copy everything except files I didn't have permission to copy (e.g. some stuff under Documents and Settings), and for those situations I've got the /skipdenied switch. Some day I'll add a switch that enables the SE_BACKUP privilege to make that behavior even better. Unless one of you wants to submit a patch. :) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Speaking of patches. As of now, the project is &lt;a href="http://sf.net/projects/wangdera/"&gt;hosted&lt;/a&gt; at SourceForge under the &lt;a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php"&gt;MIT license&lt;/a&gt;, so have at it! (Make sure you &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=117783&amp;amp;package_id=204974"&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; the right one - there are separate binaries for XP and W2K3.) Just go easy on me if you look at the source - it's been &lt;strong&gt;years&lt;/strong&gt; since I wrote much C++. :) &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>143</thr:total></entry><entry><id>38364</id><published>2006-09-20T07:51:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-09-20T07:51:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Announcing HoboCopy</title><content type="html">Hmmnn, I got the interop to work, you use the VSSCoordinatorClass class:

&lt;br /&gt;John: glad you liked the style - writing C++ after years and years of C# was a major challenge. As it is, I find the HoboCopy code to be a real mishmash of traditional C++ and C# styles.

I had aborted a local backup copy process, and then tried to start a new one to the UNC.  I've a feeling (could be wrong!) that the VSS was still processing the first request, and so hobocopy gave me an error.  After playing with it some more I managed to get it working.

&lt;br /&gt;On another 2 notebooks however, the story is different.  When I try to run the program for them I get the following error:

I believe if you wait a while, VSS will clean up after itself. A reboot will probably also do it, as will obtaining a copy of vshadow.exe and running it with -da (delete all shadow copies). 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As for the "system cannot execute the specified program" error, that's a bit weird. It sounds like something important is missing. Can you point a copy of depends.exe at the EXE and see if it shows any missing dependencies? Perhaps the C runtime? 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I can think of is that it might be an OS/platform thing.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for writing this and making it available under the MIT license! I'm working on a backup program (Box Backup) that I want to add VSS support to, and this should help if I need sample code that's compatible with the license (unlike the VSS SDK). 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'm trying to access the methods of IVssBackupComponents by IDispatch, rather than vtable, to help users who don't have the header files and want to compile the code. However, I think that maybe VSS doesn't support IDispatch properly. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I can get an IDispatch interface from IVssBackupComponents, but when I try to get the DISPID of the AbortBackup method using GetIDsOfNames, I get the error (HRESULT) 0x8002801D, which seems to be TYPE_E_LIBNOTREGISTERED. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This is not a documented return code from GetIDsOfNames. Any ideas what I can do, if anything?

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Also, if I try to get an IDispatch interface from VSS.VSSCoordinator, CoCreateInstance returns E_NOINTERFACE. Do you know how a scripting language such as C# manages to call methods on this interface? Is there a header provided, or some other way to call methods such as StartSnapshotSet, as DuncanS seems to have managed to do from C#? (I have never programmed in C#, I'm using C++ to try to get this interface).

You may or may not encounter the same limitations. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Second, there's no reason at all that VSSCoordinator has to implement IDispatch - it's completely optional. In fact, it comes with a set of restrictions that may well have been too severe for them. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Third, C# isn't a scripting language - it doesn't have to use IDispatch at all (and in fact doesn't) when calling VSSCoordinator methods.

&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your answers. If C# doesn't use IDispatch, do you know how it does call methods of e.g. VSSCoordinator? Presumably it doesn't understand C++ headers? Does it use the type library and LoadRegTypeLib, ITypeInfo and Invoke? Some other mechanism?

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;HoboCopy seems to be exactly the tool I've been looking for. I intend to use it to backup VMware virtual machine files. In order to get the VM in a consistent state, I need to suspend (pause) it and make a copy of that paused state.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I would like to use HoboCopy with its VSS capabilities to minimize downtime, i.e.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;1. Suspend VM
&lt;br /&gt;2. Take Snapshot
&lt;br /&gt;3. Resume VM as soon as snapshot has been taken
&lt;br /&gt;4. Do the actual backup
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Is there any way to know when VSS is done with taking the snapshot?

I suppose the easiest thing would be to modify Hobocopy so that you can give it a script that it runs before/after the snapshot. I'm not planning to spend any time on Hobocopy to do that right now, but you have the source and it shouldn't be a difficult modification. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Ideally, the way this would work is that VMWare would provide hooks into the VSS APIs that would take care of this automatically. VSS is designed specifically to allow for the exact case you describe (this is similar, for example, to what SQL Server does when you take a shadow copy) but apparently VMWare doesn't support it right now. Too bad.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;thanks for your hints on implementing it. My C++ skills are barely existent, but maybe I'll ask a friend to do it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;For why VMware Server (which I use) doesn't natively support VSS: I guess it's marketing strategy. "Server" is their free product, designed to get people hooked on virtualization. Their enterprise product, ESX, which costs quite a few Dollars, has, afair, advanced snapshot capablities (in combination with their own prorietary file system, VMFS)  and there are a number of products availabled specifically designed to do live backups of VMs.

&lt;br /&gt;First - great tool!  I'm trying to use this for a backup solution, and I can almost use this to reconstruct a bootable windoze HD.  What I do is run Hobocopy on the entire HD (C:) to a network share.  Then, I plug a new (empty) hd back in, boot off of a CD, format and copy the boot sector, mount the network share, and proceed to copy over everything to the "new" HD.  When I boot, I get a number of "strange" errors.  It does boot into windows, but the system is unstable and doesn't seem to work correctly.  I checked the backup log, and it seems to have aborted and skipped all files in C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys, with Message "Error accessing File...Skipping".  I'm also not entirely certain that the registry is copied over 100% intact.  You mentioned that you use this yourself for your backups.  Have you solved these problems?  If so, can you share that?

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As for the registry issue, I don't have any information on that - all Hobocopy does is create a shadow copy and then call CopyFile, so I'm not sure what it could do differently to correct any issues there...</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="38362"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>49286</id><published>2007-11-26T13:12:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-11-26T13:12:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Announcing HoboCopy</title><content type="html">Hi Craig,

&lt;br /&gt;but unfortunately, i met a problem. 
&lt;br /&gt;I am trying to backup all the data in my c: partition to my e: partition.  i login as an administrator and run "HoboCopy.exe /r c:\ e:\" in the console, but the result is always:

It sounds like Hobocopy is unable to create the directories it needs to on the E: drive. That may well be a bug in Hobocopy - possibly it's barfing when trying to create the root directory, although IIRC it shouldn't try to create the directory if it already exists. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I think you've hit on the workaround for now - don't use a root directory as the destination. One thing you could try would be to use linkd to "mount" your E: drive at some other location and then use that as the destination. E.g.: 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;linkd D:\mount\e E:\
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;hobocopy /r C:\ D:\mount\e
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'll investigate the bug, but it'll probably be a while before I actually get around to fixing it.

Just one question though.

Does Hobocopy support long directory paths or directory paths with spaces in their names?

I'm getting the error below trying to back up my Outlook 2003 PST file from the default installation directory..

I'm using the standard windows quotes ("") to enclose the full directory path to solve this as without them Hobocopy interprets directory paths to the first space as a command argument

Hobocopy works like a dream in all my other test cases.

See sample input-output below:  

C:\Temp\software\Hobocopy\HoboCopy-1.0.0.0-XP-32bit-Release&amp;gt;hobocopy /full /skipdenied /y /r "C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook\" C:\Temp\testbak2\
HoboCopy (c) 2006 Wangdera Corporation. hobocopy@wangdera.com

Error calling GetFullPathName: The parameter is incorrect.
 (Error number 87)

C:\Temp\software\Hobocopy\HoboCopy-1.0.0.0-XP-32bit-Release&amp;gt;

I have XP 32 bit and have backed up other data with Hobocopy to the same destination folder.

Any ideas?

Vshadow does have an option for running a program before terminating, so you might be able to use that, but I'm not sure whether you're allowed to mount the shadow copy on a drive letter, so actually accessing it might be hard. </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="38362"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>53004</id><published>2008-09-15T08:13:36.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-09-15T08:13:36.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Announcing HoboCopy</title><content type="html">Hi Craig,

Thanks for the reply.

I tried to modify your code by adding a call to SetContext(VSS_CTX_NAS_ROLLBACK) and commenting out writers involvement + code for backup. After I run your modified code, I could see vshadow returning shadow copy (created by your code) with -q option.

Thus it seems VSS does support persistent shadow copies. Actually what I am trying to achieve is that I want to use a NDMP compliant backup software &amp;amp; NDMP server for backup and recovery. So actual backup will be taken care by NDMP server and I just want to use VSS for creating snapshots.

One question I would have is whether the shadow copy sticks around for long - I've seen cases where a shadow copy will survive after the program crashes, but it eventually gets cleaned up. I'm not sure how often that happens - certainly a reboot will do it. 

Other than that, I'm not sure what advice to offer. At this point you've done more research on it than I have. :) 

I agree that a tool that just creates the persistent snapshot would be more useful than hobocopy, as robocopy already provides far better copying utility than hobocopy. So if you can figure out how to get a drive mapped to a persistent shadow copy under all operating systems, that would be great! 

Of course, I'm left to wonder: if it's possible, why can't vshadow do it? Have you looked at the vshadow source to see what it does? </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="38362"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>53077</id><published>2008-09-15T23:53:08.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-09-15T23:53:08.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Announcing HoboCopy</title><content type="html">Craig, the shadow copies created by modified hobocopy does not get cleaned up after a reboot.

This was exactly what I was trying to achieve.

But now, I have another doubt. Do you have any idea what role does SetBackupState play in creation of snapshot. I mean, if I call SetBackupState with (VSS_BT_FULL or VSS_BT_INCREMENTAL or VSS_BT_DIFFERENTIAL) does snapshot that will be created differ?

I have to support full, incremental and differential backups in my application. calling SetBackupState with appropriate backup type is all that I need to do? Or do I have to take care of these while actually backing up data?

You can yourself confirm whatever I have done.

There's a flag -p in vshadow copy which can be used to create persistent shadow copies. Using this flag you can create a persistent shadow copy. (e.g. C:\vshadow -p D:). This will not cleaned up unless you call DeleteSnapshots

After creating a persistent shadow copy this may, you can get the snapshotID of this shadow copy using vshadow -q.

Now using vshadow -el={SnapID}, G: you can mount that shadow copy to G: drive of your system. You can get exactly same data in G: drive which was there on D: drive.

But you need windows server to run this. since winXP does not support persistent shadow copies.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="38362"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>53132</id><published>2008-09-16T08:13:17.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-09-16T08:13:17.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Announcing HoboCopy</title><content type="html">Well that explains my confusion: I thought you were doing all of this on Windows XP/Vista.

There is a bug in hobocopy having to do with spaces in filenames, but it doesn't look like you're hitting it given that you can do a full copy - it should be the same code path.

I've seen this error as well on Windows 2003 Server x64 and it actually led me to this page. The problem is revealed by Dependency Walker as missing MSVCP90.dll and MSVCR90.dll.

Those files are not included in the redistributable for VC ++ 2005. The simpliest solution seems to be using the 2008 redistributable instead.

Hope this helps someone else.

This is a very interesting piece of code!  I am a programmer myself and had a problem to solve at work involving using Microsoft's ImageX tool to make a backup of a live Windows workstation (XP) or Windows 2003 servers and write this to a working .WIM file for system recovery purposes.  I originally started toying with the idea of writing my own VSS "wrapper" program that would allow ImageX, actually, may be my own implementation using the Wimgapi library, to backup locked/in-use files.  I then stumbled upon this site, looked over the code and decided that before I tackle a write of my own, did Microsoft provide some form of utility already that meets my goals?  There is no need to re-invent a wheel, unless I can make a better wheel:)  At any rate, here is what I have found:

Use Microsoft's own vshadow.exe located here: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0B4F56E4-0CCC-4626-826A-ED2C4C95C871&amp;amp;displaylang=en

Use dosdev.exe to map a drive letter to a mounted snapshot

Look at this site: http://www.eggheadcafe.com/tutorials/aspnet/f6972828-1e81-4cd4-ae0c-36196a82ed25/workstation-open-file-bac.aspx

In my testing on a Dell Latitude D510 laptop running Windows XP SP2, I was able to backup the entire C: drive into a Windows .WIM file using Microsft's ImageX tool.  I then rebooted into Windows PE 2.0 on a USB pen drive, formatted the entire C: drive, then re-applied the Windows .WIM file back onto the empty C: drive, after which I restarted the machine.  Voila!  It works!  I was able to backup a live running instance of Windows XP SP2 into an ImageX .WIM file and then use this to completely recover the system.  I will run some tests on our Windows 2003 servers.

Note: Windows 2008 server comes with a program called: diskshadow.exe that is basically vshadow.exe and diskpart.exe rolled-up into one.  I am going to try that utility on Windows 2003 server and Windows XP to see if it works.

I was looking for a way to make a duplicate boot drive copy in order to do some experiments with beta drivers and BIOS changes that (I discovered the hard way) tend to corrupt the boot drive.

After trying many different things (including Hobocopy) I stumbled upon some things that might be of interest to you and others that are now running Vista Ultimate.

I discovered that Vista creates a persistent shadow copy whenever you create a restore point (right click on "computer", select "properties", "advanced system settings", "system protection", and click "create").

Now if you open "computer" and right click on the drive you want to work with you can select "restore previous versions".  This doesn't actually restore anything yet and in here you can "open" the persistent shadow copy of the drive.  You can now do anything you like with this shadow copy, but more interesting is the path used to access the persistent shadow copy (it will be something like "\\localhost\C$\@GMT-2009.02.11-08.00.18") works with any application or utility (including robocopy, xcopy, dir, etc.).

For example you could type "robocopy \\localhost\C$\@GMT-2009.02.11-08.00.18 x:\ /e /b /copyall /purge /sl /r:5 /V /np /xj /tee /log:robocopy-c2x.txt" and this will make a complete, bootable copy of the entire C-drive on the X-drive.  By editing the registry (load hive) found on the X-drive to swap the C: and X: letters around and using "easyBCD" to add booting to X:, you end up with a fully bootable copy of the C-drive on the X-drive.  When you boot the X-drive, it now comes up as C and the original C remains safely unaltered (you can even unmount it so it is better protected).

So - in summary to access a shadow copy in Vista Ultimate (possibly other versions also):

1.  Create a "system restore point" which actually creates a persistent shadow copy.
2.  Open the latest "previous version" of the drive you want to work with and note the path (eg.  \\localhost\C$\@GMT-2009.02.11-08.00.18).  This actually opens the shadow copy in explorer.
3.  Note the path and use it with any application or utility, including robocopy, etc.  The path is persistent (you don't need to keep explorer open).

Note you can also create a shadow copy in Vista using the vssadmin command (instead of creating a restore point).  Then using "vssadmin list shadows" you can get the \\?\... path, but not all applications/utilities can access the shadow copy this way.  You can still use the "previous versions" trick to find the \\local\... path after using vssadmin to create a shadow copy.

Another trick I stumbled upon that also works well, but requires downloading the utility "dosdev.exe" from microsoft.com (download MPSRPT_CLUSTER.EXE and use winRAR to extract just dosdev.exe) is to do the following:

1.  Create a persistent shadow copy using "vssadmin create shadow /for=c:".
2.  Use "vssadmin list shadows" to find the \\?\... name of the shadow copy you want to work with.
3.  Use "dosdev T: \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy4" (substitute the correct name) to mount the shadow copy temporarily to T:
4.  Now use any utility, including robocopy to work with the T-drive (such as robocopy T: X:...).  The only downside is T: can only be accessed from the command shell where you ran dosdev.exe, but this method works well for a batch script.

Note you can download MPSRPT_CLUSTER.EXE from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=cebf3c7c-7ca5-408f-88b7-f9c79b7306c0 (scroll down and download just MPSRPT_CLUSTER.EXE).  Dosdev.exe can be extracted using winRAR as I mentioned above and placed in any directory you wish (ideally in your PATH somewhere).

I hope this information helps some of you.  Hopefully these same commands will work with Windows 7 too.

I am a chinese.
Hobocopy goes wrong when file or directory has a chinese name.
I think the reason is that locale is not set.
eg: locale loc=locale::global(locale(".936"));
So,can you solve this problem and publish it?
or just mail me one release.
Thanks a lot!

Just a guess there, though. 

At any rate, I'm not really sure what to tell you. It could be that your VSS installation is hosed - can you take snapshots using vssadmin?

I haven't installed TrueCrypt.

To make it easier, I copied the lines needed to run to a new text file, and then saved it as "fix.bat".  Doubleclicking the bat file runs them one after another.  Note:  for me, there were a few errors after some of thoe lines but it did fix it anyway.

What gives?

If I do a vshadow -p on a specific drive/volume, will it generate more "Previous Versions" of files on just that drive? How does vshadow -p {protected drives} differ (if at all) from creating a Systemwide (application?) restore point from Control Panel??

Google does a Captcha check on addresses it thinks are spammers,
but there _should_ be an option in your Google Groups Profile to allow you to enforce it for ALL posters.
Some of the projects are now spending all their time weeding out garbage posts.

I think you might be better going with Sourceforge;
they have good developer street cred
and they can host your moderated posts
with BBoard/Captcha software of your choosing
(a possible case of "get what you pay for"?)

I see something about them hosting forums on their "Create Project" section, but I don't see any specifics as to what they offer to furnish
(besides hosting...);
I'll be talking with them about that...

But James' statement &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-LEFT: 50px"&gt;I have been using &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; for sometime and I have to say that Screwturn really blows it away. It has built in security, one-click backup, its extremely customizable, and much more.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-LEFT: 50px"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;sort of caught my eye, as you might imagine. :) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Contrary to what seems to be the unfortunately frequent open-source practice, I'm not interested trashtalking ScrewTurn wiki. In &lt;strong&gt;my &lt;/strong&gt;ideal world, ScrewTurn would do everything that &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; does, plus more, and there'd be a syntax converter. Then I could switch to ScrewTurn wiki and spend my limited free time making it (or something else) better. Since that doesn't seem to be the case (it looks like they both have features the other lacks), I guess I'm going to stick with &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; for now. :) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;At any rate, if you're in the market for a .NET-based wiki, I highly recommend you check out ScrewTurn. I haven't installed it yet, but I've skimmed the docs, and it sure looks like they've got a solid project. It looks like for now the choice between &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; and ScrewTurn depends on your particular requirements and preferences, so it's good to know about the options. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;And to any ScrewTurn devs that read this - if there's anything &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; can do to help, or if you have suggestions about what we can do better (there's lots), or if you can think of interesting ways to work together, just let us know. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>11</thr:total></entry><entry><id>41066</id><published>2006-10-23T09:01:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-10-23T09:01:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: ScrewTurn Wiki</title><content type="html">This is the beauty of Open Source.

&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I was reading &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2006/10/23/microsoft-ajax-library-at-the-ajax-experience.aspx "&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; today about the Microsoft AJAX Library, and something struck me: the [ScriptService] attribute makes this is a new web service toolkit. "Duh", you're saying. But the interesting thing about this one is that it's a toolkit that .NET web service authors probably can't ignore. Up until now, I've been getting the message from most of my clients that the only web service client they really care about is .NET. That sort of begs the question of "Then why use web services at all?" but that's perhaps a topic for another time. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;At any rate, given how software from Microsoft is usually received by developers in the Windows world, I suspect that people will be forced to consider the AJAX Library when designing their .NET web services. And granted it's written by the same company, but I'll be completely stunned if the two stacks are completely isomorphic. Hell, it's hard enough to get the .NET stack to talk to itself across XML serialization sometimes. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I think this constraint is going to be fundamentally positive. It's generally true that the second client is much harder to write than the third, as the number of generalizations you have to introduce decreases. So if people start testing against two different clients (even if they are both from Microsoft) then it'll be that much easier when it comes time to integrate with Java, or Ruby, or whatever the hell comes next. Which is (at least one of) the point(s) of doing Web Services. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Should be interesting. At the very least, it looks like I should devote some time to playing with [ScriptService] to find out what the limitations are. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Apparently, there's still at least one person out there using &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/10/12/2760.aspx"&gt;RichTextBox2/RichTextEditor&lt;/a&gt;. And he wanted to use it from managed C++, of all places. And it wasn't working, of course. So he emailed me, and I was happy to help. Of course, it took some research, since VC++ isn't exactly my first choice for writing Windows Forms applications. (Like, I didn't even know VC++ has a forms designer now!)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The problem occurs any time you try to add a control to a form when the control was compiled against .NET 1.x. When you do that, you'll see errors like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Error C3699: '^' : cannot use this indirection on type 'System::Windows::Forms::Cursor'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;warning C4945: 'DescriptionAttribute' : cannot import symbol from 
'c:\windows\assembly\gac\system\1.0.5000.0__b77a5c561934e089\system.dll': 
as 'System::ComponentModel::DescriptionAttribute' has already been imported 
from another assembly 'System' 
c:\windows\assembly\gac\system\1.0.5000.0__b77a5c561934e089\system.dll&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This is due to the fact that when you add the control to the form, VC++ helpfully adds references for the control's dependent assemblies to the form. Unfortunately, those dependencies include things like the 1.x version of System.dll, and you've already got references in your project to the 2.0 version of System.dll. Hence the conflict. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The solution is to go into Project-&amp;gt;Properties-&amp;gt;Common Properties-&amp;gt;References, where you must remove references to the duplicate 1.x libraries. Easy. And hopefully easier to find now. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>42113</id><published>2006-11-13T09:19:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-11-13T09:19:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Speaking at CapArea .NET UG</title><content type="html">Tomorrow night (Tuesday, November 14th) I'm speaking at the Capital Area .NET Users' Group meeting.

Aside from his many useful technical posts, I enjoy reading his posts about his son, Zenzo. That's due at least in part to the fact that Zenzo is right around a year younger than my daughter Ellen, so hearing about Zenzo learning to crawl, walk, or whatever brings me back to when Ellen was passing the same milestones. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;It was with particular interest, however, that I read Scott's latest Zenzo post, entitled "&lt;a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BabySignLanguage.aspx"&gt;Baby Sign Language&lt;/a&gt;". I was going to leave a comment on his blog, but frankly I just don't like comments. It's a subject for another post, but essentially I find that I just never go back to the site after I leave a comment - I've tried stuff like &lt;a href="http://www.cocomment.com/"&gt;CoComment&lt;/a&gt;, but nothing has really been natural and easy. So I figured I'd just post here instead - the trackback is generated automatically, which is better than nothing. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;But to the subject at hand: Baby Sign Language. We did this with Ellen. I'm a HUGE fan of it. But I knew I would be - I have a brother who is thirteen years younger than me, so I can clearly remember him as a baby. He has &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome"&gt;Down Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, so he was unable to speak at all until he was nearly three. It was just too difficult a skill. My parents got the brilliant idea of teaching him ASL, and we were all signing simple signs with him for probably a year before he could communicate verbally. It was great - really helped him express himself. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Given my experience, I was pretty determined to teach Ellen sign language as well. Alice (my wife) was totally open to the idea (indeed, she probably would have done it regardless of whether I'd be interested) so we started with Ellen when she was something like six months old. For us, the primary sign was for "milk", which we'd show her every time she got fed. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Just like Scott, it was initially like signing to a wall. She didn't seem to care, and she certainly didn't sign back. But I knew from my brother that it was just a matter of time, and sure enough, at about eight months, Ellen was able to mime the sign back to us. It's pretty amazing to get any communication whatsoever (other than smiling and crying) from an eight-month-old. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Of course, she stopped signing shortly thereafter for a good six weeks, but once she started again, there was no stopping her. She probably knew about ten signs ("milk", "eat", "more", etc.) before she could speak her first word ("ball"), and she probably knew over two dozen when her verbal vocabulary passed her signing one. It was our primary way of communicating with her for months and months, and was a great help to both her and to us in knowing what she wanted. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Right around the time Ellen was really catching on to the signs, we had a friend staying with us for an extended time. He'd been &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/10/31/16061.aspx"&gt;hit by a car&lt;/a&gt;, so he had a lot of time to sit around and watch Ellen learn. His comment? "I'm totally doing this with my kids when I have them." Which was my exact sentiment from watching my brother. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It's funny for me to hear resistance to the idea. The one that really puzzles me is the "it'll slow down their speech" one. Not only is this contrary to clinical evidence (IIRC - we did the research but I no longer have the citation), but my personal experience has been the opposite. Ellen, like Zenzo, is bilingual in verbal languages (Chinese and English), and despite that seems to have verbal capabilities comparable to her contemporaries. Bilingual children generally take a bit longer to reach the same level of speech in a single language than children only learning one language (again, I don't have a citation any more). &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;But setting that aside, I always point out to people that &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; children use sign language. Every kid reaches their hands up when they want to be picked up, and every kid waves to indicate "goodbye". There are probably other examples - gestures are so baked into communication that it's hard to even think of them. Teaching ASL is just an extension of this. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;I can't recommend teaching ASL to your baby strongly enough. It's totally worth it. And don't worry if you don't know ASL - just make up some sign and use it consistently. We used to do that all the time for new stuff we didn't know the sign for. Of course, it's not hard to find &lt;a href="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/Sites/aslweb/browser.htm"&gt;signs on the Internet&lt;/a&gt;, but when you're in the heat of the moment, anything will do as long as you pick something, tell your spouse, and stick with it. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'll close here by answering one more of the questions Scott posed: Does Ellen still sign? Yes she does, but not to communicate. She communicates exclusively (and nearly endlessly :) ) verbally, but there are about five signs she still makes even when speaking. For example, she still signs "sorry" even as she says it - in English or in Chinese. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>23</thr:total></entry><entry><id>42346</id><published>2006-11-22T06:46:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-11-22T06:46:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Baby Sign Language</title><content type="html">I agree wholeheartedly.  We taught a few signs to each of our three kids, and it's was a big help.  The fact is, pre-verbal kids still have a desire to express themselves, and their motor skills develop faster than their verbal skills.  Sign language is a great bridge to help get past that difficult phase where they know what they want, but can't tell you.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Signs we taught included "milk", "juice", "eat", "more", "Mommy", "Daddy", "up", and "down", and a few others.  That simple vocabulary was enough to help a 10-month-old get some messages across that otherwise would have been sources of frustration.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and our experience has not been that their speech was impacted or delayed.  They're all excessively, constantly verbal, and from an early age.

The results are amazing! There has been so much research done on the benefits; reduced tantrums, higher IQ, greater parent/child bond, greater reading and vocabulary skills….. I can’t see a reason not to teach your child to sign!

Just yesterday my 14 month old was sitting in his high chair with a sippy cup of juice. He (like always) said “uh-oh” and threw it on the floor. So I put it in the fridge and we all continued our breakfast. A few minues later he was getting upset and pointing at the fridge doing his sign for “milk”. I gave him his juice and he threw it back on the floor and kept signing “milk”. So I filled him a glass of milk and he was so happy! If he didn’t use Baby Signs(R) then I would’ve thought he was just ready to get down and wasn’t thirsty, not that he didn’t want the juice and preferred milk instead.They really do know what they want and they are so proud when they realize they’ve been understood.

I am a Certified Independent Baby Signs(R) Instructor in Oregon offering classes for Parents and Caregivers, Parent/child classes, specialized playgroup classes and ECE (Early Childhood Education) classes for daycare centers. Private classes at your location available. Each class comes with a great kit full of tools to help you continue signing with your baby at home.

Inquire @ babysignswithelizabeth@gmail.com

And whether you take a class or teach yourself at home just keep signing with those babies!

type="html">I've just recently installed Vista for the first time - I never even looked at any of the Betas, CTPs, or RCs. I guess I'm getting old (turned 35 yesterday, in fact), since I no longer leap on beta technology like a pack of starving hyenas on a wounded wildebeest. 

So far it's going pretty well. I'm not sure I much like the new UI features - I find Glass to be a bit too, well, glassy. If I want glare I'll point my binoculars at the sun (good gods I *am* a cranky old man) . But I'm going to leave it on and see if I can get used to it. 

One hitch I hit was stupid, but I'm guessing that I won't be the only one to hit it. I installed IIS7, and then spent the next half hour trying to find the management application. I located the (awful) command-line tool, but couldn't find the inetmgr.exe GUI. Then I went back into the Windows components installer and realized my mistake...there's a separate checkbox for the management tools that I hadn't checked. Oops. 

Anyway, you've been forewarned. Unless the reason you wound up here was you had the same problem and are searching the Internet for the solution. :)</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>43664</id><published>2006-11-30T12:30:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-11-30T12:30:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Missing IIS Administration Tools in Vista</title><content type="html">My advice: leave DWM on, but turn off the transparency effect.

I just reinstalled, and I haven't got anything decent to post with - the .Text web page that I'm using right now sucks. Anyway. 

I just posted &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; 1.8.0.1739 to the SourceForge website (http://sf.net/projects/flexwiki). This is primarily a bugfix release. Given that our last official release was in late 2005, there are a fair number of bugs that have been fixed, too. There are also some minor feature enhancements - you can check out the change list on the project website. 

There are three reasons that it's been so long since the last official release: 1) We've been focused on &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; 2.0. More about that soon. 2) We do continuous integration at http://builds.flexwiki.com, so anyone that wanted updated bits could have gotten then from there any time. 3) We haven't had a release manager, so posting bits on SourceForge has been low priority. Hopefully #3 will change soon - we're working on it. 

As always, the best place to get support with &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; remains the flexwiki-users mailing list. You can subscribe via the &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; project website.</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>43667</id><published>2006-11-30T13:05:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-11-30T13:05:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">FlexWiki 2.0 Alpha 1 Released</title><content type="html">I just posted &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; 2.0 alpha 1 on the SourceForge website. Frankly, I'm rather excited. Although it's only at alpha stage, I've been working on this project for well over a year. After extensive rearchitecture, I'm finally at the point where I can start working on the thing that sent me down this path in the first place: a reasonable security model for &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt;. 

If you have a chance to try out the new bits, please do so. Keep in mind that they are alpha: things generally work, but you're bound to run into issues now and then. Things that specifically don't work right now are caching (although you could argue it never worked that great in the first place) and SQL Server support. Those will get implemented in the coming months. 

Enjoy!</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>43681</id><published>2006-11-30T16:51:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-11-30T16:51:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: FlexWiki 2.0 Alpha 1 Released</title><content type="html">Looking forward to migrate to 2.0, especially from file-based to SQL server-based.

&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We're in Minnesota for the Christmas holiday, visiting my parents. On Thursday morning, we took Ellen to the &lt;a href="http://www.mcm.org"&gt;Minnesota Children's Museum&lt;/a&gt; with my mother. The place was absolutely great - I enjoyed it, Ellen enjoyed it, Alice enjoyed it, and my mom enjoyed it. Highly recommended. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The last thing we did before we went across the street to &lt;a href="http://www.fujiyasushi.com/"&gt;Fuji Ya&lt;/a&gt; (probably our favorite sushi restaurant - also highly recommended), was to stop in at the toddler area of the museum. Cutely entitled Habbitot. They've got a series of platforms, slides, and stairs that are just perfect for the kids to explore. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Ellen was playing on one set of stairs, and being the bossy little girl she is, decided that no one else should be able to play on them. The first little person that went by, she just yelled "no!" to. That got my antenna up - but I didn't do anything about it. Then a little boy - probably a year her junior - crawled by, and Ellen raised her hand to hit him. She's got a temper on her, but she's also pretty obedient, so I did the Dad thing and barked, "Don't you even think about it!" quickly enough that she thought the better of it and put her hand down. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Unfortunately, I think I put a little too much &lt;em&gt;oompf&lt;/em&gt; into the command, because I looked over and the little boy she'd been about to hit was looking at me like I was Godzilla, tears already brimming in his little eyes. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Oops.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I apologized to his parents (who were very understanding), and fled. :) &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>45442</id><published>2006-12-23T21:10:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-23T21:10:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Verbal Shotgun</title><content type="html">Craig,

&lt;br /&gt;You took her to Mellon Capital Management (check the link)? No wonder she was bossy! :) Folks... go to http://www.mcm.org/ for the Children's Museum site. Thanks for the post, Craig. I'm going to take the kids over the holiday break - but I'll try not to use the daddy voice.

&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I note first of all that it was a relatively light year for blogging for me. That's sort of unsurprising for a few reasons. First, I've been doing it for over three years now, so it's not quite as exciting as it was when I started. Hopefully, y'all still find it worth reading. Second, I have a toddler. Enough said. :) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;2006 was a busy year for me, technically speaking. By my count, I was involved in at least nine different software projects. I even shipped a few of them, like the &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2006/06/12/27273.aspx"&gt;MTPS Content Service&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2006/06/12/27288.aspx"&gt;msdnman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2006/09/20/38362.aspx"&gt;HoboCopy&lt;/a&gt;, and two releases of &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2006/11/30/43667.aspx"&gt;an alpha of version 2.0&lt;/a&gt;. And that's not to mention some of the work I did for some of my clients that I can't talk about. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Obviously, I've got more work to do in a few spots, including finishing &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; 2.0 (oh ye gods, in the name of logic and mercy, &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; let me finish it in 2007) and shipping a new version of HoboCopy (this one's already in the can, I just need to post it). &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The big stuff this year had nothing to do with the computer, though. First, &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2006/10/28/41329.aspx"&gt;Ellen turned two&lt;/a&gt;. Contrary to the popular stereotype of two-year-olds, she's been enormously fun and very well-behaved. I guess we're only two months into it at this point, but so far, two is my favorite age! But so were zero and one. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The other biggie was that &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2006/05/05/22953.aspx"&gt;Alice graduated&lt;/a&gt;. The positive impact of this on our personal lives cannot be overstated. Even more exciting than the graduation itself is that - even though I suspect she has her doubts from time to time - I'm certain than she's going to put her degree to good use in 2007, doing something really interesting. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As for me, I'm hoping that 2007 is a bit less busy than 2006, but just as interesting. From a work standpoint, I'm off to a good start on that one. I've got a project that I can't talk about just yet that pretty well ensures the "interesting" part, and I've finished up a few of the other ones on my list that should help with the "less busy" bit. But we'll see - I'm not historically very good at saying "no" to good opportunities. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In the near term, I'm very, very close to finishing &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/courses/appliedDotNetArch.aspx"&gt;my .NET architecture &amp;amp; design class&lt;/a&gt; for Pluralsight. It distills a lot of the lessons I've learned in my career - it's largely centered around the discussions I find myself having with clients over and over again as I move from gig to gig. So I think it'll be worthwhile for a lot of people. Maybe I'll see you in class sometime in 2007. :) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'm not a big one for New Year's resolutions - I much prefer to strive for excellence all the time - so I'm not going to say, "I promise to blog more in 2007". More isn't generally better anyway. What I do hope is that I frequently learn new things that make me think, "Wow, I should share that with everyone" and that then I do. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

Today I posted the results of that tinkering: HoboCopy 1.0.0.0. Yes, it's stable and complete enough that I feel comfortable with the 1.0 label. You can download it from SourceForge &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=117783"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The highlights of the new release include the following: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixed a nasty bug&lt;/strong&gt;. OK, you know how I said that HoboCopy would work with VSSAPI-aware applications like SQL Server to get you a consistent view of application state? Well, it turns out that I lied. I had a bug with the part of the process called component selection, and as a result the old version of HoboCopy was always giving you crash-consistent copies…i.e. whatever the hell was on the disk. That has been fixed, and SQL Server (and other VSS-aware applications) will now correctly flush their state before HoboCopy copies the files. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vista compatibility&lt;/strong&gt;. As Vista is now my main day-to-day OS, this was a must. Sadly but understandably, using the VSS API requires administrator privileges, so I had to add a manifest to HoboCopy so it'll give you that little secure "running elevated" prompt when you run HoboCopy under UAC. This sort of sucks for a command-line tool, since it launches another cmd.exe, meaning any errors immediately disappear when the process exits. Maybe I'll figure out a fix for that in a future version. In the meantime, running HoboCopy from an elevated cmd.exe is a reasonable workaround. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Default non-recursive processing and f&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ilename filters.&lt;/strong&gt; You can now run &lt;font size="4" face="Cordia New"&gt;hobocopy C:\sourcedir C:\targetdir *.txt *.foo&lt;/font&gt; to copy only files with the .txt or .foo suffixes. Recursive directory processing is off by default, so you need to run &lt;font size="4" face="Cordia New"&gt;hobocopy /r C:\sourcedir C:\targetdir *.txt *.foo  &lt;/font&gt;if you want to include child directories as well. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There are a few more minor things I'd like to add to HoboCopy - specifically, to make it asymptotically approach robocopy's capabilities - but at this point it works pretty darn well for 99% of what I want to use it for, so I'm not sure it'll ever make it to the top of the project heap. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One more note: if you have any trouble running HoboCopy, it's probably because you don't have the VC++ runtime DLLs on your system. Run vcredist_x86.exe and try again. I've made vcredist_x86.exe available for download in &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=117783"&gt;the same place as HoboCopy itself&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Anyway, download and enjoy. Let me know if you have any problems. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>63</thr:total></entry><entry><id>45628</id><published>2007-01-08T08:34:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-08T08:34:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Announcing HoboCopy 1.0.0.0</title><content type="html">God I love the name of this tool. ;)</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="45624"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>45629</id><published>2007-01-08T09:05:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-08T09:05:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Announcing HoboCopy 1.0.0.0</title><content type="html">Thanks - it was one of those odd moments of inspiration. :)</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="45624"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>48081</id><published>2007-07-25T07:36:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-07-25T07:36:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Announcing HoboCopy 1.0.0.0</title><content type="html">&lt;br /&gt;Doh!

The source compiles on VS8, but the exe does not run.. I get:
"The application has failed to start because stlport.5.1.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem."

Visual Studio complains with:
"Debugger:: An unhandled non-continuable STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND exception was thrown during process load
The program '[94712] HoboCopy.exe: Native' has exited with code -1073741515 (0xc0000135)."

And, also depends.exe complains about two dll's: 
STLPORT.5.1.DLL (as expected) and also DWMAPI.DLL

Any clues?

I'm tinkering around with a hobby project that might need to use VSS, so I just might take you up on that offer if I'm in a total fix on some part or other of the code... :)

On a different note, it seems your choice to use C++ was in the long run, the right one... I found this on one of the comments on this site:

http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/makeshadowcopy.aspx?fid=966755&amp;amp;df=90&amp;amp;mpp=25&amp;amp;noise=3&amp;amp;sort=Position&amp;amp;view=Quick&amp;amp;select=2496895

Not sure how reliable this info is, but it seems to make sense in view of the lack of documentation:

&lt;quoting holmes="holmes" scott="scott"&gt;
I went to the work of contacting the Microsoft VSS team. I was able to create the interop for vista and 2008 however in vista and 08 the vss coordinator class is lacking the ability to create and do snapshots along with a few other things. I was informed that the vss coordinator class is unsupported and was only made for internal use thats why its not documented anywhere on msdn. The only way to do it for 08 and vista is to write something in mc++ and make calls to it. The correct class to use is the IVSS coordinator. 


What do you think?

Managed C++ sounds like the cleanest option, since the rest of the stuff will probably be written in C#.
Not too sure here (I never used managed C++), but this is obviously assuming that the VSS SDK can still be used through managed C++ right?

From simple tests in command prompt, I have seen that it can't directly access the \\?\GLOBALROOT\... path. Is there a way to expose this path to external programs? I'm not sure how I can use VSS to copy locked files (registry, databases, etc). The machines are running Windows XP and Server 2003.

I don't want to simply copy the files/directories as some of the databases are quite large and it would add a lot of overhead. How can I access the shadow copies in my code or an external program?

zip.exe is Info-ZIP.org's program.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="45624"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>74354</id><published>2010-01-19T05:18:05.0-05:00</published><updated>2010-01-19T05:18:05.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Announcing HoboCopy 1.0.0.0</title><content type="html">You should be able to mount a drive letter (e.g. Q:) at \\?\Globalroot\... I don't know what the API for that is, but it should be easy to find. The only caveat is that with non-server versions of VSS, the shadow copy disappears from the namespace once the program terminates, so if you spawn any external processes, the process that initiates the shadow copy will need to stick around. 

I've been thinking about making a tool that would do more or less exactly this for some time now. </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="45624"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>75303</id><published>2010-02-26T23:52:18.0-05:00</published><updated>2010-02-26T23:52:18.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Announcing HoboCopy 1.0.0.0</title><content type="html">Starting a full copy from c:\WINDOWS\explorer.exe to C:\explorer.exe

&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;After doing a little digging, I realized that the problem was the version of the VC++ runtime I installed. I had run vcredist_x86.exe, but I had run the version that came with the RTM version of Visual Studio. Of course, HoboCopy was compiled with the SP1 version of Visual Studio, because a bug in the C++ compiler means it won't compile at all on the RTM version. Once I installed the updated vcredist_x86.exe, HoboCopy works again. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Of course, I had posted the wrong version up on SourceForge. I've fixed that - the version of vcredist_x86.exe available &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=117783&amp;amp;package_id=204974&amp;amp;release_id=476826"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; now matches the one HoboCopy is expecting. &lt;/div&gt;

Really lucky. I have frequently had the fortune to get paid to play with new technologies. Right now I'm starting a project where I get to use WCF and WPF (curses on the Microsoft drone who dropped the far cooler names of "Indigo" and "Avalon"). It's fun. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Of course, life on the bleeding edge is not without challenges. For starters, there's the fact that I don't know what the hell I'm doing yet. That's usually the case anyway, but what's different now is that Google can't always save me. Usually I just type in some well-chosen search terms and lo and behold someone else has made the same mistake. Only it looks like I get to go first this time. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;At any rate, I'm working on a project that makes use of the &amp;lt;WindowsFormsHost&amp;gt; control tag in XAML. This very cool tag, shown to me by &lt;a href="http://sellsbrothers.com/"&gt;Chris Sells&lt;/a&gt;, allows an Avalon form to host a Windows Forms control. In my case, it's the WebBrowser control, as Avalon (I'm going to keep calling it Avalon until no one can understand what I'm talking about) has no browser control in-built. However, when I went from the sample project that Chris sent me to my project, I kept getting build failures:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Error MC3074: &lt;font size="-1"&gt;Unrecognized tag 'WindowsFormsHost' in namespace 'http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation'. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;After about half an hour of digging, I figured out that the problem is a missing reference. In my case, I was missing a reference to WindowsFormsIntegration, an assembly that can be found on my computer in C:\Program Files\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\v3.0. Once I added it, all was well again. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Given what little I've been able to dig up on Google, I'm guessing this is going to be a common problem, so hopefully this post will help someone else at some point. Just be aware that it might not be WindowsFormsIntegration that you need to reference - I believe this error to be a general symptom of some missing reference, and not that assembly in particular. You'll have to do some detective work to figure out which one you need. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>45835</id><published>2007-01-23T19:30:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-23T19:30:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: XAML and Error MC3074</title><content type="html">A very cool tag indeed, but not needed for web browsing as Avalon seems quite able to do this all by itself.

I finally got the page with the links to the RSS feeds to render, and I was a bit surprised when Outlook popped up showing what was obviously an ASP.NET error message. I was even more surprised that the same URL worked just fine in IE (I'd been testing with Firefox). &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A little debugging and I think I figured out what's happening. Firefox appears to be launching Outlook as the registered application for RSS documents (presumably based on the ContentType, which is text/xml). Anyway, that's fine - I use Outlook to read RSS feeds, so great. What's &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; great is that Outlook decided to lowercase the URL. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Hello?! URLs are case-sensitive! Who thought it was a good idea to screw with the case of URL? I mean, it's fine to write a web application that accepts either case on the server side, but you can't just &lt;strong&gt;send&lt;/strong&gt; either case as a client - you have to assume case sensitivity. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; is highly case-sensitive as part of its design. So the lowercased namespace in the URL results in a failure to look up the right information. I'd write a fix for this into &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt;, but frankly I'm not sure that's a good idea. Outlook seems (to me) to be pretty clearly broken on this one. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I googled (lowercase intentional) for info on this but wasn't able to turn up much. Anyone know anything? &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>46310</id><published>2007-03-06T08:38:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-03-06T08:38:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Outlook Feed Bug?</title><content type="html">You only discovered ONE bug in Outlook's RSS implementation?

I think it's the coolest of the .NET 3.0 family of technologies. Although I'm going to be attending Pluralsight's upcoming &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/courses/DoubleFeatureWcfWf.aspx"&gt;Workflow &amp;amp; WCF Double Feature&lt;/a&gt; in Waltham, so maybe more exposure will change my mind. I doubt it, though. :)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One of the areas that really interests me in Avalon is &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/System.Windows.Documents"&gt;System.Windows.Documents&lt;/a&gt;. It interests me because it looks like it could make the next version of &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.FlexWikiPad"&gt;FlexWikiPad&lt;/a&gt; really easy to write - a well-thought-out model for text presentation that doesn't require messing around with a WebBrowser control. I'd even gone so far as to start writing &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig/TextEditor.html"&gt;a text editor control&lt;/a&gt; using .NET 1.1-era technologies. So I was happy when my current project gave me a chance to start dabbling in &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/System.Windows.Documents.FlowDocument"&gt;FlowDocument&lt;/a&gt; and friends. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One of the questions I ran across pretty quickly was "How do I include an image in a FlowDocument?" There's no Image element in System.Windows.Documents - just stuff like Paragraph, List, Bold, Span, etc. A quick question fired of to &lt;a href="http://interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog"&gt;Ian&lt;/a&gt; (tired of my questions yet, dude?) revealed &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.documents.inlineuicontainer.aspx"&gt;InlineUIContainer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.documents.blockuicontainer.aspx"&gt;BlockUIContainer&lt;/a&gt;, two wonderful classes that let you embed arbitrary Avalon controls inside a FlowDocument. All I had to do was wrap one of them around a &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/System.Windows.Controls.Image"&gt;System.Windows.Controls.Image&lt;/a&gt; control and I was off to the races.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Definitely a nice pair of bullets for the Avalon gun. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>46507</id><published>2007-03-19T06:40:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-03-19T06:40:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Your Code May Be Suboptimal, But This T-Shirt Is Perfect</title><content type="html">&lt;div&gt;A few weeks ago, &lt;a href="http://www.ericsink.com/"&gt;Eric Sink&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://sourcegear.com/"&gt;SourceGear&lt;/a&gt; posted &lt;a href="http://www.ericsink.com/entries/Mag_Ads_March2007.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. I try to read everything Eric writes - he's one of the few guys on the business side with a background in the pointy end of the business he's managing, so he's got an interesting perspective. Plus, he seems damn smart. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Anyway, if you scroll down to the end of his article, you'll see a picture of the rockin' t-shirts they were giving away at SD West. I don't much make it to conferences any more, but I wanted a shirt. So, because Eric also seems like a nice guy, I emailed him to ask for one. I thought I'd offer to pump up the free advertising factor a bit by agreeing to post a picture of me wearing the shirt here. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Well, I ventured an email and gained a t-shirt. Here's my end of the bargain: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/wangdera/426750627/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/169/426750627_6d0b519911.jpg?v=0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'm not sure you can read it at this size (click the picture to jump to Flickr, where you can get the full-size version), but the evil mastermind robot dude is saying, "Your code is suboptimal". &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;My daughter wanted in on the act as well: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

I'm writing an Avalon (WPF) application, and the damn thing wouldn't shut down. Even though I was calling this.Close() in my File-&amp;gt;Exit handler, the process would stick around. It was particularly insidious because the main window would close, making it &lt;strong&gt;look&lt;/strong&gt; like the application had exited. Even though I knew it had this problem, I would still forget until the next time I would compile, when I'd get the error, "The compiler can't overwrite the file (dumbass)."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://bearcanyon.com"&gt;Mike Woodring&lt;/a&gt; and I spent what must have been close to an hour reviewing all my threading code to make sure it was correct. It wasn't, of course (it never is), but after we'd tried everything I ripped all that code out and it &lt;strong&gt;still&lt;/strong&gt; wouldn't close. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It bugged me enough that it was the last thing I was thinking of as I fell asleep last night. And then - and I'm sure this has happened to most people reading this - I solved the problem in my sleep. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Here's the deal. I had a class that looks more or less like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;public partial class MyWindow : Window { &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  private readonly MyDialog _myDialog = new MyDialog(); &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  protected void OnFileExit(...) {&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;    this.Close(); &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  }&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Where MyDialog is another Window. I like to use this pattern for dialogs that I'm going to pop up and down a lot: create it once during the constructor. That way they keep all their settings and whatnot when they're not visible. And in WinForms, this works great. &lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt;, in Avalon I needed to do this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;public partial class MyWindow : Window { &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;  private readonly MyDialog _myDialog = new MyDialog(); &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;  protected void OnFileExit(...) {&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;    this.Close(); &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;    _myDialog.Close(); &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;  }&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;even if you never displayed the dialog! &lt;/em&gt;Because otherwise, you apparently still have a top-level window hanging out, and Avalon won't let you exit the process. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;I haven't looked to see if there's some magic property that says "OK to nuke the process if this window is still around". You may want to check the comments on this post - given my level of knowledge of Avalon at this point, it's likely that someone out there knows better how to address this. Certainly, having to remember to Close all your subordinate Windows can't be the best way. But it beats having to run Process Explorer to kill the process every time. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>46529</id><published>2007-03-20T09:39:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-03-20T09:39:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Re: Avalon (WPF) Application Not Closing</title><content type="html">Pretty easy, once you know what to do (Chapter 1 of Petzold's book has this info):

I found out better solution for closing all loaded windows in WPF:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;for(int i = 0; i &amp;lt; Application.Current.Windows.Count; i++)
&lt;br /&gt;	Application.Current.Windows[i].Close();
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This will close all windows and so whole application. If you do not wish to say to all windows "bye-bye" ;), you can use this:

I guess that's why I get occasional questions about the website. Of course, I was involved in writing the Microsoft/TechNet Publishing System (MTPS), the system &lt;strong&gt;behind&lt;/strong&gt; the web pages, and not in the actual rendering stuff, but I try to help when I can. So the other day when someone asked me a question, I shot off an email to someone on the team to see if I could get him an answer. The response I got taught me something cool I didn't know about the website, so I thought I would share (with permission). &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There are three new features to the MSDN2 website - two you may have noticed and one you probably haven't. The first one that's a bit more obvious is that the nav tree recently started loading asynchronously in its own iframe. What this means is that you no longer have to wait for the tree to load before you can view the content. As "I don't want to wait for the tree" is easily the number one complaint I have personally heard about the site - woohoo! Further changes are planned to make this even better. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Another one you might have picked up on is that the "trail of bread crumbs" navigation control along the top of the content (the internal MSDN term for it is "the eyebrow") has some added functionality. It now sports an AJAXy dropdown feature that makes it easy to navigate to siblings of the current node or any of the current node's ancestors. Go try it (for example, &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.image.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) - you'll see what I mean. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The final, more subtle feature is that you can hit the 't' key to toggle visibility of the nav tree. I love this feature because I often just type in a URL to jump directly to a piece of documentation, so I don't need the tree at all. But whether I do or not, toggling the tree lets me use the full width of the screen for the content…very nice. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So kudos to the rendering team for making the MSDN2 site nicer to use! &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>46615</id><published>2007-03-29T06:38:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-03-29T06:38:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: 'T' Is For &amp;amp;quot;Too Cool&amp;amp;quot;</title><content type="html">Thanks for the info.

&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The description from the project page: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-LEFT: 50px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Package This is a GUI tool written in C# for creating help files (.chm and .hxs) from the content obtained from the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library" class="externalLink"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSDN Library&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; via the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://services.msdn.microsoft.com/ContentServices/ContentService.asmx" class="externalLink"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSDN Content Service&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. You select the content you want from the table of contents, build a help file, and use the content offline. You are making personalized ebooks of MSDN content. Both help file formats also give full text search and keyword search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The code illustrates how to use the MSDN Content Service to retrieve documentation from MSDN. It also shows how to build .hxs files and .chm files programmatically.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It's great to see interesting new applications making use of the web service!  &lt;/div&gt;

There is, however, the fact that this is a bit weird to debug - as you step through you wind up jumping back and forth between contexts. Nothing that an experienced developer can't deal with, but anything that adds to the cognitive load required to maintain a piece of code needs to be carefully considered. The older I get, the more I realize that maintainability is the most consistently underserved of the &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig/FiveConsiderationsForLargeScaleSystems.html"&gt;five design tenets I like to remember&lt;/a&gt;. There's something to be said for having all the code right there in your face. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Syntactically, this gets a bit better with C# 3.0 due to the cleaner grammar for anonymous delegates, but I think it still has some of the same maintainability problems. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Of course, I've done this sort of thing myself. But I always think hard before I do it, and sometimes I feel a little dirty afterwards. Overused, this is a real maintenance nightmare. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Before someone jumps down my throat with a "so we should just repeat all that code, then?" I'll preemptively respond with two points: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol type="1" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well, it's what we did in .NET 1.1. How bad was it then? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every decision involves tradeoffs. Sometimes the tradeoffs involved make the decision easy. Sometimes they only seem to. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>46716</id><published>2007-04-11T08:06:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-04-11T08:06:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Enveloped abstractions and manageability</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="46712"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>46744</id><published>2007-04-12T20:16:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-04-12T20:16:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Caveat Abstractor</title><content type="html">I wrote this [1] last weekend.

I don't do much C++ any more, so the adjustment has been &lt;strike&gt;somewhat&lt;/strike&gt; extremely painful. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;See, I'm trying to implement a new &lt;a href="http://addins.msn.com/devguide.aspx#AddingaNewStore"&gt;protocol handler&lt;/a&gt; to integrate with Windows Search. I have some content in a database, and I want to surface it along with other search results using Windows Desktop Search or the native Vista stuff. In the process, &lt;a href="http://sticklebackplastic.com/Posts/PostsByCategory.aspx?categoryId=cee6f10d-307c-4b6f-8f1b-c3562d627ec2"&gt;this set of posts&lt;/a&gt; has been an excellent resource. In fact, it's nearly the only resource for writing protocol handlers as far as I can tell.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;While I was reading the posts and (slowly) implementing away, I decided that it would be a good idea to follow the suggestion turn on ATL QueryInterface debugging. Especially given that my code appeared to be doing nothing. So I was a bit annoyed to see output like this in DebugView: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;[3552] CProtocolHandler&lt;br /&gt;[3552]  - &lt;br /&gt;[3552]  - failed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Those dashes are supposed to have interface names or IDs before them, and they're supposed to tell me what interfaces are being QueryInterfaced for. What's worse is that when I followed the link in the articles and read &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/craigskibo/archive/2004/01/12/58023.aspx"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, it looked as if the problem was fixed in VS2005, which I'm using. But it obviously wasn't. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Soon enough, I was down in the bowels of the ATL code (atlbase.h, no less), trying to figure out what's up. Well, eventually I spotted it: the code change they made to AtlDumpIID to fix the problem in VS2003 is still broken in the case where the registry keys can't be read. In that case, instead of dumping the raw ID, they dump…nothing. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'm guessing that this is a Vista (which I'm using) problem that has to do with security being a lot more locked down. At any rate, if you encounter a similar problem, you'll want to change AtlDumpIID to something like the code below. I'm sure you can do better - this sometimes prints IDs twice, but it was the smallest change I could make to get the effect I wanted. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;#if defined(_ATL_DEBUG_INTERFACES) || defined(_ATL_DEBUG_QI)&lt;br /&gt;__forceinline HRESULT WINAPI AtlDumpIID(REFIID iid, LPCTSTR pszClassName, HRESULT hr) throw()&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;        USES_CONVERSION_EX;&lt;br /&gt;        CRegKey key;&lt;br /&gt;        TCHAR szName[100];&lt;br /&gt;        DWORD dwType;&lt;br /&gt;        DWORD dw = sizeof(szName);&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;        LPOLESTR pszGUID = NULL;&lt;br /&gt;        if (FAILED(StringFromCLSID(iid, &amp;amp;pszGUID)))&lt;br /&gt;                return hr;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;I was just teasing, is all. I didn't actually read all that ATL code you posted, I just skimmed it and saw character noise and special-cases. Yuk.

&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the tangent. :P

&lt;br /&gt;I'm happy to hear you got your Debug.WriteLine working. :)

&lt;br /&gt;Btw, it's not my world, but ATL is just in the process of recovering from 'attributed programming', isn't it? I suppose there is something to be said for having all that code there in your face.

Long story short: forums.microsoft.com is badly broken and they're too clueless to fix it. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I did eventually get this to work. I had to implement both BindToStream and BindToFilter. BindToFilter returns an IFilter that reports metadata (basically a NOP implementation) and BindToStream returns the actual stream. I had to additionally implement one of the other methods - GetFileName, I think - so that the system would know what type of data I was returning.

That was handy, because I generally prefer to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting#Inline_replying"&gt;bottom-quote&lt;/a&gt;, and that's a pain in the ass when the email is HTML. So when I installed Outlook 2007 I was annoyed that Ctrl-Shift-O didn't work any more. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;After a bunch of fumbling around, I finally discovered that if you open a message and edit it (Message-&amp;gt;Other Actions-&amp;gt;Edit), you can then change it to plain text (Options-&amp;gt;Plain text). Well, being a keyboard guy, I got pretty tired of doing that, so now I have the following key sequence committed to muscle memory: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Enter (open message)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Alt H X E (edit message)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Alt P L (convert to plain text)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Alt H R P (reply)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;The only way that I know to get a kbd shortcut is to add the macro to a toolbar and set a unique mnemonic on it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Tools/Customize
&lt;br /&gt;Macros category
&lt;br /&gt;Choose macro, drag it to a toolbar
&lt;br /&gt;Right click on it, rename it and use "&amp;amp;" to assign the mnemonic (e.g. name it '&amp;amp;Plain Text' - then Alt-P should trigger it).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Strange that Outlook doesn't seem to let you bind hotkeys like Ctrl-Alt-O to macros. At least that I've been able to find.

&lt;br /&gt;I just tried adding a Command Bar shortcut to the "Plain text" command. (This is the command bar on the message editing window, rather than the message reading window, or the main window.)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So now, if I want to reply and convert to plain text, its:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Ctrl+R (Reply)
&lt;br /&gt;Alt+6 (Convert to plain text)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;...the '6' because this happens to be item number 6 on my command bar. Replace that with wherever it ends up on yours.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Since you presumably needed to do the Ctrl+R thing before if you were replying, this seems like fewer keystrokes than Outlook 2003. And no need for a macro.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="46814"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>47053</id><published>2007-04-28T03:42:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-04-28T03:42:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Converting Messages to Text in Outlook 2007</title><content type="html">What's the command bar?

&lt;br /&gt;1. It does indeed let me convert a reply to plain text. But I want to convert the original message to plain text, because that's what gives me the chevrons at the beginning of the line so I can quote in the manner to which I am accustomed.

&lt;br /&gt;2. If I add this button to the message window itself, it is greyed out. I.e. unavailable.

So when &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/archive/2007/04/26/46984.aspx"&gt;he outed himself as a REST convert&lt;/a&gt; lately, it actually wasn't a huge surprise to me - we've been talking a lot lately about what the last few years have taught us about web service programming, and how more and more SOAP/WS-* just doesn't seem to be all that and a bag of chips. Still, the key part of the analysis in his latest post - that you can use HTTP as a way to publish application states and the transitions between them - really struck me as something significant, and brought a lot more clarity to the whole problem. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;Here's where my thinking is at: Basically every SOAP web service I've written in the last four years could have been done just as well as a straight HTTP interface. And a several of them would have been significantly better. The ones that couldn't are very clearly RPC style, for better or for worse. I've been feeling this especially acutely lately as I try to optimize one of the services I've written. I found myself implementing HTTP over SOAP, which just seems stupid, not to mention clumsy. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;For me it's really not about whether the thing is "REST" or not. I find the term REST to be too laden to be useful. I think more in terms of "SOAP via toolkits" (SVT?) versus Plain Old XML over HTTP (POX). After all, I'm perfectly willing to use a SOAP Envelope as long as I still get to use HTTP GET. But at the end of the day, ignoring particular terminology, I agree with Tim's analysis: SVT is for stuff I'd use DCOM for in the old days, not for putting up a large-scale, public-facing, web-based, programmatic interfaces. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;I realize that programmers love their tools and toolkits, but honestly, when you build big giant systems sometimes you have to do things the "hard" way. It always surprises me when my clients complain that complex problems contain complexity in the solution. But in any case, I'm not even convinced that throwing away toolkits like WCF will raise the complexity level - there's a lot to be said for being closer to the wire. Plus, things like Linq for XML look &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; tasty when you consider how they might help with this style of programming. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;I do really like the analysis of REST as Representational State *Transition*, as opposed to the T being for "Transfer". To me, viewing the design exercise as figuring out how to expose a connected state graph (i.e.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;both transitions and states are explicit) brings a lot of mental order to what I already knew I wanted to do anyway. In particular, it helped me understand how a POX interface is useful for writes...because for reads it's dead obvious: GET kicks ass, especially if you care at all about performance. For a long time I was hung up on trying to figure out how to use SVT on write, and GET on read, because that seemed to make the most sense. But if the thing is just your application state where each state has an address, it's pretty obvious that it's okay to POST to a URL to cause a state transition. Or even for that state transition to significantly alter the URL space. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;Of course, I have yet to build a large, real system using this new approach. I'd love to, though, because more and more it seems like the right thing. And no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy - witness SVT. The big question is whether the big concepts will prove out for me personally. Hence my eagerness to put my customers' money where my mouth is :). &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;And before you point it out in the comments, I should say that I'm aware of the efforts to make WCF more amenable to straight HTTP-style programming. It's just that I'm dubious about the viability of exposing transport semantics explicitly via an API that's all about abstracting transport semantics. It seems to me that if you're going to remove a layer of abstraction, you should actually remove a layer of abstraction. But again, I'll need to build something real with it before I can draw any supportable conclusions. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>28</thr:total></entry><entry><id>47046</id><published>2007-04-27T18:51:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-04-27T18:51:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Link Listing - April 27, 2007</title><content type="html"> When you think things are not possible: WCF duplex callbacks through NATs and firewalls - safe and secure...</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="47002"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>47148</id><published>2007-05-02T04:03:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-05-02T04:03:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Thinking Like Tim</title><content type="html">I'm a bit flat out at the moment, and I haven't read all the stuff floating around, but this jumped out at me:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;RE: "Representational State *Transition*"
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;...I think that misses the point.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;URIs are pointers to 'entities', which are 'objects' in Plato's sense: they're transcendental. What you can do is get a representation of their 'state' *at a point in time*. Their state can change independently of your actions over time (trivially, in 1953 your URL was throwing 404; more complicatedly (that's a word, now), other users can affect an entity's state). So... it's a faux-enlightenment, I think.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Once you understand what 'state transfer' is all about then I think that's when you get, um, *HTTP*.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Certainly URLs point at a state, but indirectly, and time always goes forward. So you don't actually model state transitions, you model "entity representation" transitions, where "entity representations" are your state. It's a relevant difference, I think. (Hint: ever pressed F5 in your browser? Why? Where's the model of the state transition, then? Ah...)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;p.s. What we need is a REST 2.0, to address the whole subject/object thing. (AKA: HTTP with milk and cookies. :)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;p.p.s. PUT and DELETE Considered Harmful, and Google got it wrong. RUHIHF. ;)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;p.p.p.s. Sorry about the spelling mistakes. Lousy web browser.

I know that you're way ahead of me on thinking about this problem space, so you may have to give me some time to catch up, if indeed I ever do. :)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I agree with you that URIs are not solely a mechanism for driving state transitions. However, if you come at it from a heritage of SOAP-style interfaces, with an incomplete understanding of what "REST" is (as I have) then the realization that URIs can *also* be a mechanism for driving state transitions is key. Perhaps you hit that quite some time ago. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I don't think I disagree with you. I just found Tim's comments helpful in breaking down a particular barrier to understanding (i.e. how do "writes" fit into the picture) because of my particular background.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="47002"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>47152</id><published>2007-05-02T07:16:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-05-02T07:16:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Thinking Like Tim</title><content type="html">&amp;gt; the realization that URIs can *also* be a mechanism for driving state transitions is key &amp;lt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Totally. It's just 'state transitions' is kinda the wrong term to be using to point at the concept you're trying to isolate, because in the context of REST 'state' means something a little different to what you're talking about. You might instead consider the terms 'page transitions', or 'workflow', or... something.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I think we're basically on the same page.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Regarding terminology to avoid the term 'REST' have you considered "HTTP"? :)

&lt;br /&gt;And I've already started to eschew the term "REST". You can see that a bit in the post above - I've pretty much abandoned it entirely since then as belonging in the same category as "ActiveX" as a useful term. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'm not sure if "HTTP" is the replacement I'll settle on, but it does seem to be the leading candidate. :)</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="47002"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>47156</id><published>2007-05-02T08:05:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-05-02T08:05:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Thinking Like Tim</title><content type="html">I rather fancy POST-modern. :)

Or is it that the URI of the containing page no longer has a clear logical model for what it represents?</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="47002"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>47189</id><published>2007-05-03T18:43:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-05-03T18:43:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Thinking Like Tim</title><content type="html">&amp;gt; What's the problem with an application within an application? &amp;lt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have is making a value judgement about exactly that. Is AJAX good or bad? I can't say... it's too difficult. :P
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;It's difficult because with AJAX a URL doesn't indicate a single application state on the client any more. Suddenly the client's state is a composition of a heap of other states, and that composite state no longer has a URL which identifies it. On the other hand, it's got to have a place, but then you get into that whole "application within an application" space which feels like an infinite loop.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I know that when I use web-applications I really don't like it when I get into a view where the URL (and the time, and me) doesn't identify what I'm looking at. And I don't like it when I'm not given a 'link' to a view (so that I can open it in a new window (which is just another way of saying "download exactly that data again")).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And that's really all I know. Thinking about the implications of AJAX and reaching a solid "position" about it is too hard for me. I tend to lean toward the "AJAX is a bad idea" position, but I'm not sure I could make a clear argument about why. Maybe for the same reason that building HTTP on top of SOAP on top of HTTP isn't real crash hot.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;At the risk of being a bit sloppy again, a 'resource' is a thing that's identified by a URI. Fielding describes it as an abstract object. You can't 'touch' and abstract object, but you can get a representation of it's state at a point in time, and that's what you get when you apply GET to a URI for example. An 'entity' in the context of REST/HTTP is just the term used to describe the payload of a HTTP message (i.e. the bit that isn't a header).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In my own thinking I tend to use the term 'entity' instead of the term 'resource' to isolate the same concept. I'd prefer to use the term 'object', but that's a too heavily loaded term.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I hate browser applications, but the 'less' they do the happier I am.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Frankly I think that browsers should just be better. I.e. the 'rich' part of a web-application should be provided by the browser, not by script. That's the direction I'm generally headed in, i.e. to write services exposed by HTTP and then implement my own browser for them. Until I can get the browser part done the HTTP-based services can be useful via HTML.

&lt;br /&gt;That's an excellent point that I don't think many people of have thought of, but of course it's also a point of personal preference. Look at the popularity of shoppers' club cards (you have those in Oz?) - clearly people are willing to sell their personal information for convenience/price/whatever. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'm curious how you'd model an AJAXy application in your build-a-browser world, and how it would provide more anonymity - can you elaborate?</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="47002"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>47202</id><published>2007-05-04T08:04:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-05-04T08:04:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Thinking Like Tim</title><content type="html">&amp;gt; Look at the popularity of shoppers' club cards (you have those in Oz?) &amp;lt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, they're called "Fly Buys" or something here. I'd never sign up for anything like that, and I don't have a TV, and rarely go to the supermarket... I'm probably the worst person to ask about those. :P
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; I'm curious how you'd model an AJAXy application in your build-a-browser world &amp;lt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Well I think that some things that are missing from the browser are client-side persistence, rich text editing, spell checking, and things like that.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn't write a general purpose browser-as-a-platform thing. I'd write a very simple report presentation and/or data-entry UI, targeting a simple LoB doctype, similar in many ways to XHTML (or maybe exactly XHTML). Maybe.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;It wouldn't be general purpose, is the key idea. I.e. I'd just write a new app to support a new LoB, and I'd be interested in HTTP as the document transfer layer (and REST as a general guide to my architecture), and possibly (though not necessarily) XHTML (note the X) as the document format (else perhaps CSV, or custom XML, etc.).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Then again, I'm not trying to solve the same types of problems as a lot of other people (I don't generally write apps for massive public consumption, for example; nor do I want to), and I wouldn't likely stop supporting web standards (e.g. HTML/CSS/JS). Like I said, I'm just sort of 'heading that way', I'm not committed to anything -- just thinking about it, leaving options like that open with what I do today. Who knows what my future will bring..? (Pain, probably. :P)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'll dump Microsoft entirely (Internet Explorer and IIS specifically) the very first chance I get. That's kinda high on my list of priorities. :P

&lt;br /&gt;When Windows was on the rise, and shortly thereafter the web, there was a little bit of a cultural/philosophical gulf between the two schools of thought.
&lt;br /&gt;One thing which I think has been almost completely overlooked, and perhaps even abandoned, is the homogeneity that was supposed to be present in the Windows user-interface. I.e. I often heard (and agreed with) the notion that all apps across a user's desktop should be similar. Similar colour schemes, similar UI metaphors, similar layouts, similar shortcut keys, similar accessibility features, etc. I'm a "content is king", "keep it simple", "I have call-centre staff that need to be trained and a whole heap of apps that they need to use" kind of a person. So I liked the general premise of the Windows UI, which was never fully realised and is now in the throes of being entirely abandoned.
&lt;br /&gt;Win32 programming, in any way you want to dress it up (i.e. VB6 for me), is a crap metaphor for programming document-oriented systems used by LoB applications (or as I like to think about it more generally "those systems which facilitate bureaucracy"). The whole event-driven model is broken at that level of abstraction, and I’ve basically come away from thinking that “general-purpose” or “extensible” is a good way to think about software. The web metaphors (a la REST) are perfect for the document-oriented style of system. They have a very specific non-extensible document format (though I could design a better HTML in my sleep -- with the benefit of hindsight, obviously), and a simple and intelligent guiding network architecture (REST, basically -- the inter-machine analogue of the Unix pipe, done right (sans PUT and DELETE, which are mistakes in my view). Microsoft tries to dress this up these days in their confused, they-barely-get-it-themselves, they-are-contemptuous-of-their-customer-who-they-call-Mort, corporate-BS way as saying that "declarative programming" is a better model. ...and they're close, but still don't quite get it, in my view (I’d tell more people, except I’d get shouted down, and I don’t have much interest in that).
&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I’ve spent most of my career suffering at the hands of Microsoft’s proprietary platforms and marketing spin-doctors, so if I can (and I think I probably can) I’m going to try and jump ship all together to the safe harbours of GNU/Linux (Debian, specifically), where I can own my own technology stacks. I feel like it’s sort of reaching the point where the damage Microsoft does to me isn’t offset by the value they create for me (i.e. value I can find elsewhere, damage I don’t need).
&lt;br /&gt;That might all seem a little tangential, but it’s all relevant to the context which frames my thinking on REST, HTTP, HTML, the web, etc.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I've looked at that, and I'm not going to play. I think that a lot of its hype is rooted in innocent naivety. That said, if you can't escape The Ball Of Mud, then Ruby is as good as Javascript (which I recently discovered for IIS/ASP) and probably OK for little things.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'd be looking at either C# (via Mono) or Java, I think. I wouldn't rule out C/C++ either, although I'd probably prefer to avoid those (I keep gettin' my ones and zeros mixed up!).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I haven't been paying a lot of attention yet, but I think Sun opening up Solaris and Java is a big deal. Some people I know who have been a lot closer to Sun over the course of their career than I have say that it's "too little, too late", but my feeling is that they could spring back on the map in a big way. I think a lot of Java's problems are rooted in the fact that people were still coming to terms with OO, and most significantly they didn't heed the advice to "prefer composition over inheritance". Also Java made a few mistakes that were fixed up in C# (Value types being a big deal, I think).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Some days I flirt with the idea of just writing my own programming language. :P (Spolsky did it!) I guess what I'd like to build is an end-to-end "information technology" platform for business. It'd be consultant-ware, I guess. I'd be pretty happy to deal MS out of the picture entirely. There were a few years there where I thought they were making a genuine attempt to be "better", but now I think they were just making a genuine attempt to "look" better (where's my XHTML, puppy!?). Their platforms are a shoddy and constantly moving target, and it costs me too much to try and keep up with them with insifficient progress and not enough control (and ultimately they turn me in to a commodity, and I don't care to help them do that).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'm still surveying the territory, really (and I'm not in a huge hurry either). ...but Ruby's not it for me.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking about the difference between embedding linked content and embedding script which loads content, and (tenuously) the only difference seems to be that a program can accept user input before loading content, whereas a link will (sort of) deterministically load content ASAP.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So HTML itself is kind of like a "program within a program" then.

"AJAX" approach wasn't revolutionary either, but heck I have been trying to circumvent HTML, JS and IIS and NT for far too long. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Sure it works, until you pile some real load at it and see how the entire show scales rather poorly, on UI and on 'buy more boxes' preaching (which again I have not seen justified anywhere to date with Java or NET or big vendors; and I did build for it).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The state URI is not the answer to state- or transfer management if you see my point.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Browsers are far too limited and heavy in what they do with existing 'standards', I am with you on that completely.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;All hackery for the browser and HTTP is really expensive for the domain I target, although I will admit any day it was such a pleasure working with it. It is always at the back of my mind but I do not need another prop IIS handling or NT either, or REST vagueness.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I have change quite a few models and environments for a single application over 10 years and started with COM and Web, and the gradients in-between. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Coming back to it I believe I see that a common core is possible and one that could even target to become a model on its own. The idea was to keep all of the other environments satisfied.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Linux is certainly always an option, own stacks are too. It is the beauty of Internet, despite HTTP limitations. I am in complete agreement that being 'tied-in' and 'taken a prisoner of bloatware' is not leading to an advance.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Ruby is a result of "myMethod-ologists" that brought another lock-in, their agenda.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;While I have no problems with a rise of UriTemplate I fear it will lead to another great mess, of typeinfo, of XML overabuse, and of shoe-horning everything under HTTP-induced breakage.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As great Jim said, 'we do not need frameworks, we need environments'. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And a stack can be a part of many environments.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And stacks can have a context that extends far, far beyond a nice but fragile idea, URI.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This is why I still believe SOAP might have got a wrong, wrong end of the stick and became a misconception. And I am no XML fan (all the high-level rants at http://sixyears.wordpress.com say more).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing wrong with playing by your rules and utilising Internet or even Web for any idea you have. Slapping HTTP on top of TCP is dead easy. That is the type of freedom that Web will be challenged on and finally cracks are appearing.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, Web had a very good run, one I never expected to last so long or to twist so much (oh well pardon my Lisp/Ruby/SmallTalk):

&lt;div&gt;I seem to say this every few months, but this is a pretty major milestone on the long, long road to &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; 2.0. Specifically, this is the first release where essentially everything from &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; 1.8 works again. So the RSS feeds, the newsletters, and the administration pages have all been repaired, which is nice. The one thing that's still broken is the SqlProvider. Since most people use the FileSystemProvider, I don't think that's a huge deal. I'm fixing the SqlProvider even now, and it will be present in &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; 2.0 Beta 2. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The major new feature in Beta 1 is the security infrastructure. &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; now sports topic-level security. That means you can put something like this&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;AllowRead: user:candera&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;DenyEdit: anonymous&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;in a topic and it'll work. You can also do this sort of thing on a per-namespace basis, or wiki-wide. It works with either Windows or Forms authentication, and I've even thrown in a simple implementation of some login/logout pages for people that want to get something simple set up for Forms authentication. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;If I seem excited about the security stuff, it's because I am: the whole reason I ripped &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; apart (starting nearly two years ago!!) was to make it possible to add security in a maintainable fashion. Now it's done. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;You can read more about the new security features &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki/FlexWikiSecurity.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As far as the road ahead, there are really only two tasks remaining before I can shove &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; 2.0 RTW out the door: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol type="1" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix the SqlProvider. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze and tune performance. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I've already started the SqlProvider work, and I don't expect too many problems. Performance could be easy or could be hard - I'll need to start by comparing the performance of the 2.0 bits with the 1.8 baseline. That'll tell me how much work I have to do. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;But any way you slice it, the release date for 2.0 RTW is a whole lot closer than it used to be. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>47227</id><published>2007-05-07T14:50:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-05-07T14:50:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: FlexWiki 2.0 Beta 1 Released</title><content type="html">Certainly looks like interesting and exciting work and would not mind trying it out.

The two formats are by no means isomorphic. As one random example, WikiText does not support background images. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So it really depends on the content. We've done manual porting efforts before where we had volunteers do it by hand, and it wasn't too bad, but that may or may not work for you.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I believe I saw &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; having pretty much the standard table tags bloat and that is a turn off to begin with. Sure, some tools to deal with CSS output are out there..
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I have my own permissioning defined, it can be in xml or elsewhere (standard tools), other tools do their job on outputing different xhtml pages and so on, it all changes daily. I wanted to drop this into a wiki and ideally integrate two authoring processes (machine and human), slap on some control and versioning, hence my inquiry.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Reading however manual work might be required is a no-go.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of ASP.NET turn-off in general, while MS as is looking at profiles, network service bits and more while their CLR is banging with 0x80131506 (Fatal Execution Engine Error), I 
&lt;br /&gt;believe it is all to do with state of x64 support.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In any case, thanks for your input once again.

&lt;br /&gt;My organization has grown very dependent on our internal &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt;, and we can't afford to loose any data, functionality, or bear much downtime (a working day might be OK)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;We use the FileSystemProvider, with multiple namespaces.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;BTW Does Flexwiki 2.0 support per page RSS? (That would be a really valuable feature, because the wiki could act as a blackboard to disseminate specific information)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The security features sound very promising. I can see that this feature may elevate our use of &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; to a more official corporate level.

&lt;br /&gt;If you're using the FileSystemStore, the upgrade should be pretty painless. The only thing you should have to do, in fact, is move the &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; settings from NamespaceMap.xml and web.config to flexwiki.config. Eventually I intend to automate this, but for now it's a manual process. I don't expect it will take you more than an hour.

Excellent advice, as usual. Here's my somewhat less serious advice, in the form of a quote from "Star Trek III: The Search for Spock": &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-LEFT: 50px"&gt;Kirk: "How long to re-fit?" &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-LEFT: 50px"&gt;Scotty: "Eight weeks. But you don't have eight weeks, so I'll do it for you in two."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-LEFT: 50px"&gt;Kirk: "Do you always multiply your repair estimates by a factor of four?"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-LEFT: 50px"&gt;Scotty: "How else to maintain my reputation as a miracle worker?" &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-LEFT: 50px"&gt;Kirk: "Your reputation is safe with me."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-LEFT: 50px"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I always multiply my initial gut-reaction estimate by four. So if I think it'll take a day, I tell the client it will take a week. If I think it'll take a week, I tell the client it'll take a month. This works really well for a couple of reasons: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol type="1" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My initial gut-reaction estimate is almost always wrong by a factor of two or three. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I tell the client it's going to take a week and it takes three days, they're thrilled. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The funny thing about all this is that &lt;em&gt;it still works even if I tell the client what I'm doing beforehand.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Weird but true: I tell them a week, they know I actually think it'll take a day, but they're still happy when it's done in three. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Of course, this really only works after I've established a track record of delivering solutions to hard problems. And my miracle worker reputation gets a bigger jump from not telling them beforehand, so I usually don't.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Recently I got asked "How long to add this link to our web site" (or something equally trivial). In my head I went, "Um, like, ah, Five Minutes". Then I went, "...but, I'm not going to have a spare five minutes this week, and it's five minutes to add the link, but it's also ten minutes just to open visual studio, and five minutes to test locally, and five minutes to fix the typo/spelling mistake, and then thirty minutes to do a build, and thirty minutes to get it into the staging system, then a little wait to have the customer confirm that it's OK, then thirty minutes to get it into production". So... it'll probably knock out most of a day. But, if I think it's actually going to take a day, then I should say a week, because I'm demonstrably always overly optimistic. Besides, at least a week will *pass* (while I'm not working on it) before I get the opportunity to even look at it. So I say "Look, it's pretty easy. It'll take five minutes to add the link. A day to get it into production. Say a week."
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Then the manager gets my estimate, and knows that he should treat me as being too optimistic, so he hears a week and doubles it. Then he tells the customer that it will take at least two weeks.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The customer hears that it will take two weeks to add a link, and they think "There is *no way* we're going to pay for that", so they cancel their 'order', then they cancel their account, and the whole system functioned to lose business.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I actually watched exactly this happen last year, and I was really pissed off. Because my customer lost one of their customers because one of their middle managers likes to think that he "under promises and over delivers". It was the smug look on his face that pissed me off. He lost business by under-servicing his customer and covering-his-arse, then sat there with a proud look on his face.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I didn't know that any of this was going on. If I had have known that it was *really* going down like that, then I could have had that link in production in Five Minutes! Promise*.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;* Promises are estimates only and do not constitute a guarantee. Some network transfer speed required. Link may contain a spelling mistake.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But, in this case, it's in Microsoft's best interests let people do what they want with the Express editions.  The revenue lost from people using TestDriven instead of buying Microsoft's overpriced unit testing is pretty negligible, I think... it's far more important for them to keep developer mindshare.  More and more of the best and brightest are moving away from Microsoft technologies... when everything people use is a Flash-based or Google Gears-based web app that runs best on Firefox, Microsoft's operating system monopoly could start rapidly fading.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="47581"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>47597</id><published>2007-05-31T10:54:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-05-31T10:54:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Microsoft vs. TestDriven.Net Express</title><content type="html">Craig:

&lt;br /&gt;I agree with you.  None of this would have ever happened if we just used FOSS software to begin with.  And as Fowler points out, the "Alpha Geeks" are indeed slowly moving away from the pure MS platform, for reasons a lot like this.  (IMO the first steps are taken when we get fed up with VSS and move to something like SVN, and then people discover Ruby on Rails, etc... but that's another topic)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I think what raises my ire the most is the hypocrisy of Jamie.  I mean, TestDriven.NET is *not* free software.  This guy does the exact same thing that MS does with its express editions (but actually, his license is more restrictive, since he makes you pay for it if you aren't a trial/academic user).  Maybe I'd be inclined to be sympathetic if this were a GPL product, but it's not.  You want to talk ludicrous licensing terms?  Take a look at Jamie's own Section 2.2(v) in his agreement.  Sounds pretty wide open and unenforceable, and similar to the kind of interpretation that MS is complaining about if you ask me.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Thomas:
&lt;br /&gt;I guess it's partially how you read it.  MS's lawyers said in their letter what portion of the license they claimed Jamie to have broken.  It's just that Jamie and his lawyers disagreed.  And that's fine -- at that point they either have to work something out, go to court, get arbitration, or play a round of Texas Hold 'Em to figure out who will win.  What ever the right move is, it sure is NOT just arbitrarily going back on what you said you'd do whenever you feel like it.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="47581"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>47599</id><published>2007-05-31T11:17:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-05-31T11:17:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Microsoft vs. TestDriven.Net Express</title><content type="html">You're all mising the point.

&lt;br /&gt;  I believe that when AlexS refers to 5K he means he needs Team System (which is 5K retail) and that includes MS's testing tools.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Having said that I agree with your observations. I've never used TestDriven.Net but I do use Resharper (and it's integrated unit test) it's cost is reasonable and these days you can get VS Std for free if you do some virtual labs.  so for now I'm going that route.

The fact that Jamie let's responses through which support his position all the while deleting posts that question his opinion is the the hypocrisy of "open source communities".
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I maintain the internal build tools for our company.  We have over 1Mil lines of .Net code in C# localized in 5 languages so you can imagine the challenges in build and deployment.  We have custom Add-Ins, MSBuild stuff, old VSIP stuff, Macros and other stuff like autocomplete files.  Having debugged why our custom tools don't work on C# Express I can say with 100% certainty that the API's aren't exposed for Express to use Add-Ins without some sort of hacking.

&lt;br /&gt;I knew this thing was a hack to use Add-In from the second I read the post.  Now I know why Jamie wouldn't post my blog post because it would have exposed him earlier.  Thanks to Microsoft for being honest.

Try to give away a little bit in the hope that your premium offering will be valuable enough for people to actually pay money. This money will finance development. It's a common model with roots in what used to be called "Shareware".
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Jamie sure understands this model, because he's applying it to his own software.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Microsoft clearly stated their goal and wrote a EULA to that tune. Maybe they did a mistake in it (according to Jamie and his lawyer).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Well, what is the possible outcome of this?
&lt;br /&gt;a) MS fixes its EULA and/or its code and finally locks Jamie and the likes out. Jamie doesn't win - independent of pending court case.
&lt;br /&gt;b) Jamie wins his case, sets a precedent and suddenly every tool maker copies his hack. MS decides that this Visual Studio Express is not working as desired and expire it. Nobody wins.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I think that the whole situation is unfortunate and I see this mainly as a desparate attempt of Jamie to cast a wider net (increase the potential market) for his tool.

Even though I’d locked down a namespace to only allow authenticated users to edit, I was still seeing new topics getting created. Sure enough, when I tried it myself, I was able to create a new topic even though I wasn’t logged in. Fortunately, the problem only seems to manifest with new topics: editing of existing pages is still correctly prevented by the security provider. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;After a bit of digging, I figured out that the problem is with the way permissions are handled for nonexistent topics. Basically, users were granted full control over nonexistent topics. The correct behavior is for nonexistent topics to be given the default permissions for the namespace, as once they are created, that’s what they’ll have (absent explicit permission statements). I’ve coded the fix and submitted it – it’s present in build 2.0.0.49 and forward. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Note that the fix makes the wiki secure by ensuring that unauthorized writes can't happen, but that the UI is still somewhat wanting: You're not told that the write is going to fail beforehand. I'll make that change soon. I just wanted to get a patch out to solve the underlying problem as quickly as possible. &lt;/div&gt;

I didn't really expect people to use it much. I figured there'd be a few small and interesting apps - for instance, I wrote &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2006/06/12/27288.aspx"&gt;msdnman&lt;/a&gt; mostly for fun - but that it would largely be a useful but little-used service. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I was quite wrong. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The other day I found out the usage numbers for the service. The conversation went something like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Kim: "Hey, I wanted to tell you the stats are in for the content service."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Me: "Oh really? I'm curious - what are they like." &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Kim: "Here, I'll email you the numbers." &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Me: "Wow! It's only been a year and there's been 1.3 million hits - that's a lot!"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Kim: "No, that was for &lt;strong&gt;yesterday.&lt;/strong&gt;" &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Me: "…"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I was quite literally speechless. Which, if you know me, you know is a rare thing. :) That's fifteen requests per second, so perhaps I can be forgiven my momentary surprise. (Traffic has since subsided to a mere 600K requests or so per day - an average of around seven requests per second.) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I have to say I'm fairly proud of having written a web service that can sustain those sorts of loads. Of course, the credit is not due all nor even (close to) mostly to me: the service is a fairly thin wrapper around the MTPS system, and I was only one part of the team that did that. Plus, without a crack ops team it doesn't matter how good your software is - you're not scaling. Kudos to those guys as well. All I had to do was not screw up the translation to SOAP. :)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We don't really have good data on what applications are creating all this traffic. We do know that the recently-released &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2007/04/09/46692.aspx"&gt;PackageThis&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for somewhere around a third of the traffic. We know that because PackageThis is the only app currently sending an AppID header with their requests. An AppID header is just a short string that identifies the application making the request. This is something we added rather late in the development cycle, never really documented, and made optional. So maybe it isn't surprising that it's not showing up in a lot of the requests. Hopefully we can fix that at some point. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sandcastle/"&gt;Sandcastle&lt;/a&gt; also uses the service, and I wouldn't be too surprised if it accounts for the bulk of the remainder of the traffic. They're adding an AppID header soon, so we'll have better data then. It certainly will be interesting to see - personally I'd love it if there were still a whole bunch of unknown apps in the traffic pattern, as it would suggest that lots of people have found good ways to use the service. Which was our hope when we wrote it. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>12</thr:total></entry><entry><id>47808</id><published>2007-06-21T10:16:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-06-21T10:16:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: The MTPS Content Service - A SOAP Success Story</title><content type="html">Really glad to hear that, it is a kind of statistic one does want to have a name behind.

But it was always my intention to write these two back-to-back, because my experience writing the MTPS service was a major part of my most recent revelation: SOAP is no longer my default choice for writing web services. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;You've seen some of this story already. I said I've been &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2007/04/27/47002.aspx"&gt;thinking like Tim&lt;/a&gt; for a while now. That thinking has really solidified for me over the last few weeks, to the point where I'm ready to essentially walk away from ASMX/WCF/SOAP in all but a few edge cases. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There have been three main ingredients in this solidification of my "conversion". First, I managed to finish &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/RESTful-Web-Services-Leonard-Richardson/dp/0596529260/"&gt;RESTful Web Services&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog"&gt;Sam Ruby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.crummy.com/"&gt;Leonard Richardson&lt;/a&gt;. This is a first-rate book. It is going on my shelf right next to &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Transactional-COM%2B-Building-Scalable-Applications/dp/0201615940/"&gt;Transactional COM+&lt;/a&gt; as a "must read". Not that I necessarily agree with &lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt; in it - in particular I'm not sure that PUT and DELETE are appropriate choices for most web services - but the way it helped me think about URL structure in particular puts it on the "must read" list for me. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The second ingredient was a series of conversations I had with &lt;a href="http://jj5.net/"&gt;John Elliot&lt;/a&gt;, one of the better-known posters on the &lt;a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/"&gt;Win Tech Off Topic list&lt;/a&gt;. He's been telling me for years about his ideas about web services, so I took the time to correspond with him to get clarification, and it really resonated. In a nutshell, his position is that web services should be accessible via a web browser, an idea I really like. This implies a read/execute bifurcation along GET/POST, metadata via HTML Forms, and XHTML as a the primary payload. Tasty. (Apologies to John if I've misstated or over-simplified his position.) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The final (and key) ingredient was the realization that SOAP is the COM+ of the modern era. I did a lot of COM+ back in the day, even going so far as to teach classes about it and to write &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/02/04/COMXP/"&gt;an MSDN article&lt;/a&gt; on it. So for some value of "expert", I was an expert on the technology. And yet, my main piece of advice to clients these days is: don't use it unless you have to. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Note that I'm not saying that either SOAP technologies or COM+ don't work. They do. If your problem fits the solution (e.g. multi-object transactions in COM+, single-URL RPC interfaces in SOAP, for example), then go ahead. It's just that I get enough benefits and avoid enough overhead from doing it at the lower (and simpler) level in each case that it's not my &lt;strong&gt;default&lt;/strong&gt; choice any more. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It's also interesting to note that in both cases it was Microsoft - the vendor with a vested interest in me adopting the technology in question - that was the primary source of the information that led me to go down the SOAP/COM+ path. I'm not questioning anyone's integrity - it's just the nature of information that of course the COM+ message was going to be "use it for everything". And similarly SOAP. The failure to analyze whether the technology in question was the most appropriate for &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt; problems was, of course, entirely mine. But hey, like &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald"&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt; always says, "I reserve the right to get smarter." :) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;If this seems like a repeat of things I've said already, well, I apologize. But I just had to share - the realization of the parallels between my personal journey with COM+ and my personal journey with SOAP just struck a real chord with me. Your mileage may vary. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>13</thr:total></entry><entry><id>47899</id><published>2007-07-02T13:39:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-07-02T13:39:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: The Failure of SOAP</title><content type="html">You know Craig, right now I tend to agree with you. But you too are old enough to realize that we'll start adding context (services, metrics, methodologies) till REST is SOAP is COM+ is MTS is COM is OLE and such.
&lt;br /&gt;

I use POST for updates, which means that the URIs are really processing endpoints rather than locations of concrete resources (which are what I GET).

I am doing some stuff on precisely that at the moment as we need mobile phone clients in Java to be able to call them! I have it working, but although i like a REST approach to reading data, creating and updating is tricker.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In a more complex scenario - and most outside of demonstrations get that way pretty quickly - i like what WCF and SOAP give you (one of the first things i did was add SOAP headers to save passing tokens etc with every call body). I can go quickly to P2P and it's easy to separate my services and data in WCF.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;We're in a era of plugging services on the web via simple API's at the moment, but longer term this will become complex again - it has to coz business rules are complex. If i want to update Twitter and Jaiku at the same time it's two POST's, but if i was updating something important i'd want a transaction to wrap them and so on. Heck, even it is wasn't i'd *like* this (i've got a lot of positive opportunities from "throw away" posts).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;My concern is, and continues to be that i need to do work to get this to work on browsers and for other simple API clients. I'd like MS to have a tool that helps me do this and sets up the necessary settings (based on API usage scenario rather than pure service implementation).</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="47891"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>47955</id><published>2007-07-09T12:18:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-07-09T12:18:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: The Failure of SOAP</title><content type="html">A few comments: 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;* Why does it have to be WCF? WCF is designed to abstract the protocol. But the things that REST gives you are all about embracing the protocol. Sounds like a recipe for complexity to me. And indeed it is if you look at WCF in any detail. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;* SOAP-the-format is not exclusive with REST. SOAP-the-protocol is. Go ahead and use SOAP payloads in your HTTP POSTs. Of course, if all you care about is headers, there are a million easy ways to do that. Cookies, for example. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;* If you need to scale, then protocol independence is not a viable option. The idea that you can "just go P2P" inherently means abandoning things like eTags and cache control that are important for some apps. Maybe not for yours, though. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;* It's trivial to design systems for transactions without having to resort to WS-*. What about HTTP makes you use two POSTs? Unless they're two different businesses, and then frankly you have a whole host of different problems that have nothing to do with technology. Also, I have a hard time thinking of a real world scenario where this would actually come up. When it does (e.g. banking), then WS-* is probably the right approach. I don't write apps like that, though. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;* Tooling is somewhat of a concern, but frankly having spent the last five years working inside the scope of the tooling, I have found that it makes simple things simple and hard things hard. Which means I'm going to be reasonably well off doing it myself a lot of the time. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But I'm not trying to say that *you* don't need WCF and WS-*. Maybe you do - it certainly has its uses. Just like COM+ did and still does. Just that I think they're a lot fewer and farther between than I used to. To the point where I can't think of anything I've done that actually needs it.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="47891"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>47978</id><published>2007-07-11T20:18:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-07-11T20:18:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">WSDL and XML Schema make it fail</title><content type="html">I think that the biggest problem with SOAP are two of it's pillars: WSDL and XML Schema.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;XML Schema isn't so bad, it's the validation contraints that make it cumbersome. Schematron is the best tool for Doc-Literal validation, and RelaxNG is a decent alternative.

&lt;br /&gt;In that sense, I believe it failed to live up to the promise that many marketed it as having. I was one of the many who were out there promoting SOAP, so I certainly take my share of responsibility on that count. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you thought I was trying to prove more than that, well, sorry. :) The title was as much a play on the title of a previous post as it was a comment on the success of SOAP: taken together, the two parts showed how one guy (me) wrote a very successful SOAP service and yet found the technology ultimately lacking compared to a simpler alternative.

If nothing else, it keeps me from getting bored. You might think I'd choose Ruby, as that's pretty hot right now (in certain circles). And in truth I'm interested. I've even read some of &lt;a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/"&gt;The Pickaxe Book&lt;/a&gt;. But the language I've decided to devote my time to is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp"&gt;Common Lisp&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There are a number of reasons for this. I won't go into all of them, but here are a few: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol type="1" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've been meaning to really learn a Lisp for a long time. Probably since I took &lt;a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/"&gt;SICP&lt;/a&gt; as a freshman. (One of the more intimidating moments of my life: having &lt;a href="http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~hal/"&gt;Hal Abelson&lt;/a&gt; as a student in a class I taught. Really nice guy, fortunately.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do a lot of work where I turn set-based data (from a database) into hierarchical data (XML). A language based on lists and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons"&gt;conses&lt;/a&gt; seems worth investigating. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lisp has a pretty interesting reputation as "the most powerful and elegant programming language". That's quite a claim, and begs to be investigated. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every new feature that C# has sprouted has been available in Lisp for decades. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I read &lt;a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and was intrigued. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Of course, I'm going to continue to do my paying work in C#, if for no other reason than that no one in their right mind would pay me to write production Lisp code right now. But starting now, I'm going to make an effort to write all the code that I can in Lisp. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;If you're interested in getting started yourself, it's as easy as going to download an implementation. I'm using &lt;a href="http://clisp.cons.org/"&gt;CLISP&lt;/a&gt;, as it's free and seems to be pretty mature and broadly supported.  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But your analysis doesn't quite ring true for me. First, there's a big difference between the goals of a startup and those of a big company like Yahoo. So it might make perfect sense to write an app in Lisp (or something) for a few years, then port it to C++. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Second, any comment about "making a billion dollars" is irrelevant. Few if any will see this sort of money, so it's not useful analysis, even if there were some sort of linear causal relationship. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Third, GC is a very valuable technology because it frees developers from worrying about memory allocation, a source of many, many, many bugs. I speak as a guy who has written a lot of them. :) Does that mean that GC should be used everywhere? Of course not: but it should be used when it's appropriate. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;That's really what it's about, actually: knowing the tradeoffs and how to optimize. Lisp will necessarily be better at some things than C++, and vice versa. The trick is knowing when to pick what.

&lt;br /&gt;Lastminute.com was a start up. One that caused a market downturn, because a "digerati" like its directar was "a brilliant business man and technologist". Ahm, they actually "made it", and it was the slowest site on the planet and least technical company in the world.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I dig point 1, and the reason why I will join in, on the same journey for fun, and web helps it. Completely agree the implementation language is irrelevant but that other thing (you know not the iterator, not the container) is. And Msje ViaTheWeb has no Space Shuttle there whatsoever.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Also, another example, FeedBurner got 100 million for a "business rush" reason (nothing to do with technology), and if you ever do manage that with Lisp my advice to anyone would be avoid that kind of Eric fame and "I was first" or "look I am BuySpy popular" or "GIF popular" hunt.

&lt;br /&gt;All Graham did was there is make money, not enable some new technical or academic or computing revolution (which is what should drives most 'hackers' I presume).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Do you see how easy you can knock that store up today (with hindsight or not) and do you see any universal or much intellectual value in 'Shopping Store Manager'? 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I bet you could slam it with your tools in 5 days max, and better than I ever would.  However it would probably not be your best career achievement would it? It wouldn't win a PhD either.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;It is all about making money for some, and it surely helps, but I agree it can be irrelevant and reason why we give 16 hours a day to these abstract machines.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;My point was he hyped his company and 'his royal firstness', and Lisp because of the money (and it is nothing in comparison to 99% of buyouts and technical or other achievements out there).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So just putting in context why you might not want to read too much into any (including my own, naturally) *preach* that has no viable, proven, or even academic, backing. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And as you say, you are not reading it like that which is a great trait.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I do follow your response here, thanks again.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;More importantly though, some of the most succesful technical/'hacker' achievements (in monetary terms) are always kept secret because of their money-generating (I refuse to use the term 'monetizing', damn I just did it again Spears-celebrities ), value. It is real, and it is one of the highest paid computing/programming/engineering skills segments on the planet, purely because of innovation in *computation*.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So I agree it is irrelevant but you would not read it or notice it unless he hyped his string-concatinating 'achievement'. That is the 'linear causal' relationship.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I agree GC is very valuable, environments and tools or languages aimed at it allow for a cleaner initial (or refactored) model to many problems. In practice I have not seen it last too long and I did round-trip back and forth to see if it holds.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;After all, I sincerely hope we are always aware a good design can always be implemented in many languages (especially with the quality of libraries today), and thus we ought to be able to realise best of both worlds. It is highly desirable (wish .NET zealots realised that), and I wish people recognise Bjarne and friends for that.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Scalable, widespread, enabling PC boot, and most efficient infrastructure cannot be build, handled or scaled (money-wise too, forget WCF and OS licences ) in any environment remotely looking like Lisp or C#. I hope you can see that by loading that British Library WPF example.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Many factors here, like device and hardware reality, readability, maintainance, performance, cost of ownership and a lot more. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Of course, some manage to do it high level, and I am all up for productivity. Hats off to them for cheating the system, but technically it often reminds me of recent 5 year Hunt and Thomas crowd following (I like some of it, dislike the rest).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Re memory allocation problem, it has been largely solved in most 'frameworks' aiming at computation field, so in many libraries, some of those GC languages never ever so. Hence I do not subscribe it is an issue especially not these days. I went from the camp that pointers are evil and great, back and forth around 10 times. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Besides you are able to plug a GC and committee might even adopt that abomination.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So sure, GC has its purpose, and I will use it when it makes sense to. Eventually it seems to me it is just means to an end (but CLI/C++ only a mother could love, what a waste of money).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And I completely agree with you that the 'trick is knowing when to pick what'. That is why we all should go back and forth with all sorts of languages and DSLs etc. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;But, my only point was, that does not preclude metal targets in any sense of the word.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, in hindsight or not, bottom-up, up-bottom etc, you get instructions and computer architecture as the floor and build up from there.
&lt;br /&gt;

Major differences from Beta 1 include: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL Server once again supported as a store. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved SPAM protection via optional CAPTCHA requirements. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added ability to require HTTPS on a namespace-by-namespace basis. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple bug fixes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There's other good stuff in there, too - the &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?group_id=113273&amp;amp;release_id=529414"&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt; detail everything. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The major remaining issue is performance: 2.0 Beta 2 is significantly slower than the latest released version of &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; 1.8, although still usable. Performance work is ongoing, and significant improvements are expected before 2.0 is released, but for now production deployment is not recommended. That said, we're running it at &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/wiki"&gt;http://www.pluralsight.com/wiki&lt;/a&gt; because for us the new security features outweigh the slowness. And perf aside, I feel good about the stability of the code, and others have echoed that it seems pretty solid. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'm very pleased by how quickly we've moved from Beta 1 to Beta 2, and even more happy about the fact that developer activity has picked up - Beta 2 sports input not just from me, but from Derek Lakin, John Davidson, and Keith Brown (apologies if I've forgotten anyone). I'd also like to thank all the users that gave us feedback on Beta 1 and the interim builds - we fixed a pretty good number of bugs thanks to their input. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Beta 2 is likely to be the last Beta before release. I'm currently working on the last major thing that I think needs to go into a full-up 2.0 release: reimplementing caching. My hope is that I can quickly implement a reasonable story there that will bring us back to &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; 1.8 levels of performance. There will be a few cleanup things to do after that, but really, that's the bulk of the work. I won't be so stupid as to give a timeline for when I think that will happen - even if perf work were easy to estimate there's the fact that I've missed every estimate I've given for this project - but I will say that I'm pretty motivated to get this done. Devoting nearly three years of spare time to something will do that. :) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Anyway, download and enjoy, and watch for RC1 in the not-too-distant future! &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>48501</id><published>2007-09-18T16:11:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-09-18T16:11:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: FlexWiki 2.0 Beta 2 Released</title><content type="html">Any update on the performance improvements?

For me, learning a new technology usually starts with reading about it for a while, trying to form a mental model of the landscape. It took a bit of searching, but with some help, I was able to find three resources that were just what I needed. I thought I'd post them here for anyone else interested in the language. All three of these are free and available online in their entirety.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol type="1" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www-cgi.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/dst/www/LispBook/index.html"&gt;Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation&lt;/a&gt;. A really excellent beginner's book. Extremely approachable, good narrative style, describes the important bits and leaves out the advanced stuff. Highly recommended. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html"&gt;Common Lisp the Language, 2nd Edition&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;Lisp book. The style is rather dense, but once you've got the basics, that's just what you want. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm"&gt;Common Lisp HyperSpec&lt;/a&gt;. As you might suspect, this is the spec. Always useful to know where the spec is. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'd suggest reading the first, skimming the second with dives into areas that you think you might need, and browsing the third as appropriate. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As for me, I've got an interesting idea for a utility that I want to write. There's nothing like trying to solve a real problem to fill in the gaps academic exercises like reading a book leave. I'm sure you'll hear more about it here when I'm done. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>9</thr:total></entry><entry><id>48137</id><published>2007-08-03T07:05:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-08-03T07:05:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: How To (Start to) Learn Lisp in 21 Days</title><content type="html">#2 on your list is an outdated version of #3.

(Whether it's the correct way for &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; to do so is an entirely separate question.) Part of my experimentation in this space has been to embrace the idea that "XHTML is the new XML". That is, that data should be encoded using standard XHTML tags rather than custom XML grammars wherever possible. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The idea has enormous potential due not least to the fact that it makes your browser a debugging environment for your web services. However, browsers aren't the real target: custom web service clients are. And in the .NET space, there hasn't been a great API for consuming XHTML as an object graph. Oh, you could use XPath, but that's a bit messy. XmlSerializer would be preferable, but unfortunately it's no good at deserializing based on things like the value of a class attribute of a tag. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Now, however, we have Linq. So given a document like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;html xmlns="xhtml namespace"&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;ul class="alternates"&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;5&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;we can do things like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;XNamespace xhtmlns = "&lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&lt;/a&gt;"; &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;var alternates = from ul in document.Element(xhtmlns + "html").Element(xhtmlns + "body").Element(xhtmlns + "ul")&lt;br /&gt;where ul.Attribute("class").Value == "alternates"&lt;br /&gt;select from li in ul.Elements("li") select li.Value; 
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;which is extremely damn cool. Of course, I can do something even more useful and initialize objects with the results of my query doing something like this instead: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;var alternates = from ul&lt;br /&gt;   in document.Element(xhtmlns + "html").Element(xhtmlns + "body").Elements(xhtmlns + "ul")&lt;br /&gt;   where ul.Attribute("class").Value == "alternates"&lt;br /&gt;   select &lt;br /&gt;     from li &lt;br /&gt;     in ul.Elements("li") &lt;br /&gt;     select new Alternate { Value = li.Value } ;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;where Alternate is a class I've defined with a public property called Value. I imagine you can get it to work with an anonymous type, too, but so far that hasn't worked for me. Anyway, it's wicked cool nonetheless. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>48394</id><published>2007-09-08T14:06:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-09-08T14:06:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: I Am &amp;amp;quot;using System.Xml.Linq;&amp;amp;quot;</title><content type="html">Try this:

The other day someone wrote me up asking me "What are the odds that exactly three people in a room of 19 have the same birthday?" Apparently his wife had challenged him with this one and it was bugging him. I suppose he must have found me via &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2003/04/25/682.aspx"&gt;my post about the Birthday Problem&lt;/a&gt;. His problem was a bit different - the code I wrote will calculate the odds that at least two people in a room have the same birthday, not that exactly three do. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The way I approached the problem was to break it down. I realized that it's fairly easy to calculate the odds that the &lt;strong&gt;first three &lt;/strong&gt;people in a room of 19 have the same birthday: it's just the odds that the first three have some birthday times the odds that everyone else has a different birthday. The odds that the first three people have the same birthday is (1/365)^2, since it doesn't matter what the first person's birthday is, and then the other two have to have the same birthday. The odds that the rest of them have a different birthday is (364/365 * 363/365 * … * (365-16)/365). &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;That tells us what the odds of the &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; three people having the same birthday and everyone else having the same birthday is. To compute the odds of &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; three people having the same birthday, we just need to figure out how many ways there are to arrange 3 people out of 19, without regard to order (i.e. we don’t care if it's Steve, Bob, and Alice or Alice, Bob and Steve). But that's just the combination operation, occasionally notated C(n, k), and it's just n!/(k! * (n-k)!). The odds for any three people are just the odds for the first three times C(19, 3). &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As you know, I've been learning Lisp, and I figured this would be a great problem to get a little experience with. And it was. Here's the code: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;(defun fact (n)&lt;br /&gt;  "Compute the factorial of n"&lt;br /&gt;  (if (= n 1) &lt;br /&gt;      1 &lt;br /&gt;      (* n (fact (- n 1)))))&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;(defun combin (n k)&lt;br /&gt;  "The combination of n things taken k ways"&lt;br /&gt;  (/ (fact n) (* (fact k) (fact (- n k)))))&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;(defun odds-of-others (n)&lt;br /&gt;  "The odds that the other n-3 people in the room have some other birthday"&lt;br /&gt;  (* (/ (fact 364) (fact (- 364 (- n 3))) (expt 365 (- n 3)))))&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;(defun odds-of-first-three (n)&lt;br /&gt;  "The odds that the first three people in the room have the same birthday, &lt;br /&gt;and that everyone else has a different birthday"&lt;br /&gt;  (* 1/365 1/365 (odds-of-others n)))&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;(float (* (odds-of-first-three 19) (combin 19 3)))&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;To my eye, this is a lovely, compact way to express the solution. Others may feel differently. :) Also, I've made no attempt to optimize the code. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;If you're not familiar with Lisp, there are a few interesting things to point out here. First, note that the second line of each function definition (defun &lt;strong&gt;def&lt;/strong&gt;ines a &lt;strong&gt;fun&lt;/strong&gt;ction) is an optional documentation string. I just love that that sort of thing is built in to the language. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Second, one of the great things about using Lisp for this application is that it supports both rational numbers and big integers natively. That is, when you compute something like (/ 1 365) - the integer one divided by the integer 365 - the result is the rational number 1/365. If you multiply rationals, it continues to maintain the result as a rational. Plus, really large integers are also supported natively, including as the components of a rational. Which means that the expression &lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;(* (odds-of-first-three 19) (combin 19 3)) &lt;/font&gt;returns this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;105393858057485882391608381135063049633792/21153953378595625024923538729098931884765625&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Which is pleasingly precise, but you can see why I cast it to a float. :) It's about 0.5%, in case you were wondering.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I should note that strictly speaking this calculates the odds that exactly three people in a room have the same birthday and that everyone else has a different birthday &lt;strong&gt;from everyone else&lt;/strong&gt;. If you only care that three people have the same birthday and that no one else has the same birthday &lt;strong&gt;as them&lt;/strong&gt;, the odds will be slightly higher, as we have to include the case where (for example) the first three were born on March 1st, and everyone else was born on March 2nd. That just means switching the term that looks like (364/365 * 363/365 * … * (365-16)/365) to one that looks like (364/365)^(n-3). That pushes the odds up to about 0.7%. The only code change we have to make to do that calculation is this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;(defun odds-of-first-three (n)&lt;br /&gt;"The odds that the first three people in the room have the same birthday, &lt;br /&gt;and that everyone else has a different birthday"&lt;br /&gt;  (* 1/365 1/365 (expt 364/365 (- n 3)))) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Anyway, it was a fun problem, particularly to stretch my (nascent) Lisp muscles. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Oh, and I should warn you that although I think I've gotten this right, there's every chance someone who's much better than I at probability and/or Lisp will find a mistake. Hopefully if so, they'll leave a comment. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>48421</id><published>2007-09-11T06:27:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-09-11T06:27:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Birthday Problem Variation - In Lisp</title><content type="html">Well done!</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="48420"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>48472</id><published>2007-09-15T05:42:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-09-15T05:42:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Birthday Problem Variation - In Lisp</title><content type="html">Distribution of birthdays in the USA for 1978:

&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In a previous post, I talked about how I'm hoping to be able to use Linq for XML to allow me to process XHTML, my current favorite data serialization format. At the end of that post, I wrote code more or less like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;var alternates = from ul&lt;br /&gt;   in document.Element(xhtmlns + "html").Element(xhtmlns + "body").Elements(xhtmlns + "ul")&lt;br /&gt;   where ul.Attribute("class").Value == "alternates"&lt;br /&gt;   select &lt;br /&gt;     from li &lt;br /&gt;     in ul.Elements(xhtmlns + "li") &lt;br /&gt;     select li.Value;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The idea was to be able to pull the values out of a bunch of XHTML list items. The problem with this code is that it doesn't really give me what I want. If you were to look at the type of the object referred to by alternates, you'd discover that it's a &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;System.Linq.Enumerable.SelectIterator&amp;lt;System.Xml.Linq.XElement,System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Which - if you can read that expression without going blind - indicates that what I've got is essentially "a sequence of a sequence of strings". No, that's not a typo: it's a sequence of sequences, and iterating over it with a nested loop is sort of annoying.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Fortunately, it appears that &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox"&gt;Don Box&lt;/a&gt; reads this blog, or at least read that post. :) He's the co-author of the rather excellent article found &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308959.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and had I read it I would have known the solution. But even though I hadn't (I have now - you should, too), he was kind enough to drop by with a &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2007/09/06/48385.aspx#48394"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; that made everything work. Here's the code I'm using now: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;var alternates =&lt;br /&gt;    from ul&lt;br /&gt;    in document.Element(Xhtml.Tag("html")).Element(Xhtml.Tag("body")).Elements(Xhtml.Tag("ul"))&lt;br /&gt;    where ul.IsOfClass("alternates")&lt;br /&gt;    from li&lt;br /&gt;    in ul.Elements(Xhtml.Tag("li"))&lt;br /&gt;    where li.IsOfClass("alternate")&lt;br /&gt;    select li.Value;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I've made a few changes beyond just the Linq bits, but I'll explain those in a minute. The key to making the query work was removing the first "select". Having the second "from" clause follow without an intervening "select" results in a SelectMany method call (all the Linq keywords like select, from, where, etc. are just shorthand for method calls). And that's exactly what we want: SelectMany collapses the query to a single dimension. Read &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308959.aspx"&gt;the article&lt;/a&gt; for a better explanation. With this change, the query now returns something we can iterate directly over with a "foreach (string alternate in alternates)". Nice. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As for the other changes, there were a couple. One was to create a class called Xhtml with a static method called Tag that creates my XNames. This just cleans up the code a little bit from all that "xhtmlns +" stuff I had before. I also created this extension method: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;public static bool IsOfClass(this XElement element, string className)&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    // TODO: this should really account for the fact that the class &lt;br /&gt;    // attribute is multivalued - i.e. it's legal to have&lt;br /&gt;    // class="foo bar quux", and we should return true for any of &lt;br /&gt;    // foo, bar, or quux. &lt;br /&gt;    return element.Attribute("class").Value.Equals(className); &lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;to let me use IsOfClass on an XElement - I just think the syntax is cleaner, and as I do more and more XHTML processing, stuff like this should help contribute to my goal of a reasonable syntax. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>48449</id><published>2007-09-12T15:32:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-09-12T15:32:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Linqing to Xhtml - Part 2</title><content type="html">A couple of untested options for your IsOfClass method ... this assumes the full class string in `classAttributeValue'.

Lambdas and object initialization syntax - particularly collection initialization syntax - are extremely handy. Of course, I'm intentionally using them all I possibly can to find out where the cracks are. No doubt with experience I'll look at my current patterns as gross overuse. Nonetheless, it's fun. :) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I was writing some test code today in Visual Studio 2008 when I hit a good use case for lambdas. I wanted to execute a statement and compare the result to an expected value, but only if the expected value wasn't null. In that case I don't want to execute the statement at all, because it has unwanted side effects (specifically, it asserts something I know will be false). &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I could have thrown a crateload of "if" statements in to check for null, but that wouldn't be very &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself"&gt;DRY&lt;/a&gt;. The solution I hit on was to use a parameterless lambda instead. It's passed to a method that evaluates the lambda if the thing it's being compared to isn't null. It works well. What I wanted to blog here was the syntax, because it wasn't immediately obvious to me, and it didn't really turn up anything in a few moments of Googling. So here it is for the record: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;AssertEqualIfApplicable(&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  expected,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  () =&amp;gt; SomeMethodWithSideEffects(foo, bar))&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;private void AssertEqualIfApplicable(object expected, Func&amp;lt;object&amp;gt; actual)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;{&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;    if (expected != null)&lt;br /&gt;    {&lt;br /&gt;         Assert.AreEqual(actual()); &lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So it's the "() =&amp;gt;" that defines a parameterless lambda. The syntax is a bit awkward, but not painfully so, IMO. The thing I especially like about this is that the lambda allows me to use lexical closures. Which is a fancy way of saying that foo and bar in my example above can be local variables, and their values will still be accessible when the lambda is invoked. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I must not have studied enough Lisp yet, because my reaction to this is "cool!" rather than "pfagh! Lisp has had that since 1827". Oh, and &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/keith"&gt;Keith&lt;/a&gt;, yes, &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/archive/2007/04/11/46715.aspx"&gt;I realize you are laughing at me, right now&lt;/a&gt;. :)&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>48510</id><published>2007-09-19T11:46:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-09-19T11:46:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Parameterless Lambdas in C#</title><content type="html">C# has had support for closures with anonymous delegates since 2.0. And not all Lisps have closures (elisp, for example).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you really want to get lambdarific, you could make this more generic by making your null condition a predicate argument.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;    static void AssertEqual&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(T expected, Predicate&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; condition, Func&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; expression) {
&lt;br /&gt;        if (condition(expected)) {
&lt;br /&gt;            Assert.AreEqual(expected, expression);
&lt;br /&gt;        }
&lt;br /&gt;    }
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Then you could define your original method in terms of this variation, or you could have other less common conditions (expected != 0, expected != DateTime.MinValue, etc).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;    static void AssertIfNonNull&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(T expected, Func&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; expression) {

&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: &lt;/strong&gt;Fixed typo - HashSet does not allow duplicate members, just as you'd expect.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I was poking around the other day and I noticed System.Collections.Generics.HashSet&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;. Sure enough, it's a collection class with the semantics of a set: there are no duplicates no matter how many times you add an item to the set, it is unordered, and it supports intersection, union, and subset operations. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It's part of .NET &lt;strike&gt;3.0&lt;/strike&gt; 3.5, so it's &lt;strike&gt;been around for a little while&lt;/strike&gt; not quite out yet. I doubt I'm the last (although I'm even more sure I'm not the first :) to hear of it, though. Go check it out, because a set is one of those data structures that gets used all the time. If you've ever instantiated a Dictionary&amp;lt;T, bool&amp;gt; just to keep track of if you've seen something, you know what I mean. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I assume you meant "no duplicates". I hope so.. cause if duplicates are allowed then I might have to go change some code.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Also, this has been in the fx since 3.5 not 3.0.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I love your REST thinking. I too am not digging WCF's "REST Support". It kind of feels like putting makeup on a sloth.

&lt;br /&gt;As far as 3.0 vs. 3.5, the documentation says it's in both. I haven't verified it. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Dave: I'm having a good time living my version of the REST lifestyle. I've wound up rolling my own framework but it has been pretty easy, and the obvious benefit is total control over what goes out on the wire.

Who knew? Other than the people that commented, of course. Certainly not me. :) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update #2: &lt;/strong&gt;So, the "organize usings" menu item that I happened to show in the screenshot alphabetizes the using statements. Also very nice, although I'd like it better if it didn't remove the line breaks I put between groupings. Still, nice. You can also remove unused using statements. Here's the menu: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pluralsight.com/craig/images/organize-usings.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/jfland/default.aspx"&gt;Jon Flanders&lt;/a&gt; showed this to me the other day. In Visual Studio 2008, if you've just added a class for which you haven't yet added the corresponding using statement to bring the namespace into scope, you can hit control-dot, and up pops the following menu: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pluralsight.com/craig/images/using-control-dot.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;And sure it enough it pops a "using System.Collections;" in up at the top of the file. Very nice. Better still if it would put it in alphabetical order, but I seem to recall that the order of using statements is significant when Linq is in play, so maybe they couldn't do that. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;You can also access it via the right-click menu: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;using (Foo f = new Foo())

&lt;br /&gt;  using (Foo g = new Foo())

So far, anyway - maybe someone out there can tell me where I'm going wrong. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;You may know that in the Orcas version of C#, they've added support for initializing collections via the funky new object initialization syntax. You can read about it &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/03/08/new-c-orcas-language-features-automatic-properties-object-initializers-and-collection-initializers.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The issue that I'm running into has to do with the fact that I'd like to initialize a collection in an object initialization expression, but I'm using XLinq to do it, and as a result I'm getting a compiler error. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;See, I can get this to work: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Person craig = new Person&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;{&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  Name = "Craig", &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  Age = 35&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  Children = &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  { &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;     new Person&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;     {&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;        Name = "Ellen", &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;        Age = 2.9&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;     }, &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;     new Person&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;     {&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;        Name = "TBD", &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;        Age = -0.4&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;     }&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  } &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;But because this is just a simple example and in my real code I don't know the collection items at compile time, what I really want to do something is like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Person craig = new Person&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;{&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  Name = "Craig", &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  Age = 35, &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  Children = &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  {&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;     GetProgeny("Craig Andera")&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  }&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Where the Person class is the obvious implementation, and GetProgeny returns IEnumerable&amp;lt;Person&amp;gt;. Without doing anything else, I get a compiler error saying that Collection&amp;lt;Person&amp;gt; does not contain an overload of Add that accepts an IEnumerable&amp;lt;Person&amp;gt;, which makes perfect sense given that the collection initialization syntax is just shorthand for a bunch of calls to Add. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The part that sucks is that I can't get this to compose with extension methods to get what I want. That is, I'd like it if I were able to define an extension method like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;public static void Add(this ICollection&amp;lt;Person&amp;gt; collection, IEnumerable&amp;lt;Person&amp;gt; items)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;{&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;   foreach (Person item in items) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;   { &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;      collection.Add(item); &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;   }&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;But that doesn't work. I'm not sure why, but here's the list of things I hope it is, in decreasing order of desirability: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol type="1" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm doing something wrong. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn't work and there's a good reason. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn't work and there's no good reason. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Anyone have any idea which it is? &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: &lt;/strong&gt;I should have said right up front that Children is a &lt;em&gt;read-only&lt;/em&gt; property of Person. I always make my collections read-only, and would prefer to do so in this case as well. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>48741</id><published>2007-10-11T11:08:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-10-11T11:08:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: How to Improve Collection Initializers</title><content type="html">Not sure if I'm understanding this correctly, but I don't see a need for an extension method.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you're absolutely committed to doing this in a single line with an extension method, you'd need to do something silly like this:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;    static T AddToMyCollectionAndReturnMe&amp;lt;T, C&amp;gt;(this T o,
&lt;br /&gt;                                                Converter&amp;lt;T, ICollection&amp;lt;C&amp;gt;&amp;gt; getCollection,
&lt;br /&gt;                                                IEnumerable&amp;lt;C&amp;gt; items) {
&lt;br /&gt;        items.ForEach(getCollection(o).Add);
&lt;br /&gt;        return o;
&lt;br /&gt;    }
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Invoked as:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;    var derek = new Person { Name = "Derek", Age = 27 }.AddToMyCollectionAndReturnMe(p =&amp;gt; p.Children, GetProgeny());
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;That's hilariously bad, IMHO. I would think it nicer to extend to two lines, or just write a utility GetPerson() type method rather than abuse extension methods like that.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;    var derek = new Person { Name = "Derek", Age = 27 };

&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, that super sucks. I wouldn't even consider doing that. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The latter approach is similar to what I have, but it's not what I *want*. :)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;It's actually worse than I've shown, because the collection I want to populate is several levels deep in the object initialization expression, so going back and iterating is a PITA. 
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;He reminded me that a lot of ancient and primitive (ahem) cultures held (or hold) the belief that if they don't know a person's name, then they don't have any power over them.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I found that remarkably profound, not least because I'm a programmer and "names" are a big deal for me.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I guess little TBD's spirit is still free.

&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;foobar *.foo *.bar foo*bar&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;which is to say, "run foobar against files that end with .foo, end with .bar, or that start with foo and end with bar." This is a fairly familiar thing for command-line apps to do. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One way to approach this is to interpret things like "*.foo" as regular expressions. I don't particularly like this solution, since a) it makes people learn regular expressions to use my app effectively, and b) the common patterns like *.foo don't really work like you want them to - "*.foo" is a regular expression meaning "anything that contains 'foo'" rather than "anything that ends with '.foo'". &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Another way to deal with this is to use Directory.GetFiles. If you read the documentation, however, there are two issues. The first is that the caveats called out in the notes make the behavior pretty weird. For example, "*1*.txt" matches "LongFileNameHere.txt". Ick. The other issue is that this approach doesn't allow multiple patterns, so I have to scan the directory multiple times and merge the results to do the "*.foo *.bar foo*bar" example above. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I hit what I think is a fairly elegant solution, and I wanted to share it with you. The basic idea is to use string.Split, string.Join, and Regex.Escape to create a regular expression that supports exactly one "operator": the asterisk, which matches zero or more of any character. Here's the code: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;internal static bool IsMatch(string name, string pattern)
{&lt;br /&gt;  // Short-circuit common cases
  if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(pattern)) {
    return false; 
  }
  if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(name)) {
    return false; 
  }
  if (pattern.Equals("*")) {
    return true; 
  }
  if (pattern.Equals(name, StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase)) {
    return true; 
  }
&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  // Bust the pattern apart at the asterisks&lt;br /&gt;  string[] parts = pattern.Split('*');
  List&lt;STRING&gt;&lt;/STRING&gt; patternParts = new List&lt;STRING&gt;&lt;/STRING&gt;(); 
  foreach (string part in parts) {
   patternParts.Add(Regex.Escape(part)); 
  }
  // Then put it back together with .*, which matches&lt;br /&gt;  // any sequence of characters, and surround it with &lt;br /&gt;  // the start-of-string (^) and end-of-string ($) patterns&lt;br /&gt;  // so we don't match on things that only start or end &lt;br /&gt;  // with what we're after. &lt;br /&gt;  string newPattern = "^" + string.Join(".*", patternParts.ToArray()) + "$";
  Regex expression = new Regex(newPattern, RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);
  return expression.IsMatch(name); 
}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Which, I think, is pretty nice, if I do say so myself. Best of all, it has semantics that make it match what I expect file patterns to do. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Using it is a simple matter of calling Directory.GetFiles to get all the files in the directory, and then filtering it via a looped call to this method. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;You'll note that I haven't put in support for the ? operator (match exactly one character), because a) I hardly ever use this myself, and b) it would be pretty simple to bodge in if I ever needed to. It would just take a second call to Split/Join over each patternPart. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Hope this helps someone.

The list of problems is extensive, but I'll quote a bit of it here: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-LEFT: 50px"&gt;You have to turn off your pop up blocker. "You will also need to allow pop-ups (at least temporarily)." - and they REALLY mean turn it off. You can't ctrl-click. You can't wait for the yellow bar and then say allow it because the site does multiple redirects and so you never get to see the page with the yellow bar. Remember that pop up blocker is ON by default in IE. You would think MS could make this a little easier in their own browser.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-LEFT: 50px"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I rarely use IE myself (preferring Firefox), but I do know a few people on the MSDN team, so I made them aware of it. One of them posted this little workaround on ZMan's blog in response, but I think ZMan has comment moderation turned on and hasn't gotten around to approving the comment yet, so I'll put it here in case it saves someone some grief: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-LEFT: 50px"&gt;From your comments, it sounds like you are running IE7 on Vista.  If this is the case, to temporarily bypass the pop-up blocking functionality of IE7, you need to hold down Ctrl-Alt and click the link (Ctrl-click was how IE6 behaved).  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-LEFT: 50px"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;ZMan also had some issues with download location - read the rest of his post for the details. I'll reprint the response to that part here as well. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-LEFT: 50px"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-LEFT: 50px"&gt;The second issue you had regarding the controlling of where downloads can be saved by an ActiveX control and the message prompts you received is a feature of IE7’s protected mode.  You can adjust these settings by clicking on the “Protected Mode” text in the lower right area of IE7.  Finally, to draw attention to the fact that downloads are being launched with a pop-up, our content team bolded the text on the download control to ensure it stands out a little better.&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>49255</id><published>2007-11-21T05:13:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-11-21T05:13:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Temporarily Bypass Popup Blocking in IE7</title><content type="html">Why Microsft dont't have a javascript on the onclientclick to alert the user about the popup???

Ironically, I did this while trying to fix the Content-Type. Anyway, it should be working again. Sorry! &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;(For the impatient: &lt;a href="http://pluralsight-free.s3.amazonaws.com/craig-andera/design-and-implementation/001-REST.mp3"&gt;link to episode 1 (MP3)&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;For a long time now, &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald"&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt; and I have called each other up on the phone whenever we have an interesting or difficult technological decision to make. The conversations have often been very interesting, and are in a large part responsible for the way I think about software. A while back, I was thinking to myself, "Man, we should record these - I bet other people would be interested in this stuff as well." &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So we did. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Announcing the first episode of "Design and Implementation", a podcast by Craig Andera and Tim Ewald. You can grab the MP3 &lt;a href="http://pluralsight-free.s3.amazonaws.com/craig-andera/design-and-implementation/001-REST.mp3"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In our inaugural episode, we explore the topic of web service architectural styles, such as REST, SOAP, RPC, and Resource-Orientation. If you read our blogs, you'll know it's something we've both been thinking a lot about recently. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;At some point in the future, we'll get a proper landing page together, with a feed and everything, but until then just watch here or on &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald"&gt;Tim's blog&lt;/a&gt; for announcement of new episodes. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We've already got a few more shows planned out, but with two and a half kids between us and the usual demands of life, I don't think we're going to be able to post more often than once a month. After all, (apparently unlike &lt;a href="http://www.hanselman.com/"&gt;Scott Hansel(Super)man&lt;/a&gt;), I need to sleep. :) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We had a great time doing the first show, and I think you'll enjoy it. That said, I know we have a lot to learn about recording and producing a show, so if you have any advice/compliments/complaints, please drop a comment here! &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I listened to the podcast and enjoyed it a lot!  I hope you continue them!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;From listening I guess I am still grappling with the whole "transaction" as a first class citizen in the REST world.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I think my major malfunction comes from having trouble breaking free of the "RPC" paradigm in the case of complex writes.  REST makes a lot of sense to me in read and CRUD oriented systems however getting into the state transitioning and complex writes still hurts my head some.  I can't wait to hear you guys talk more about it.
&lt;br /&gt;

Well, unlike certain software companies I could name, when we say "Release Candidate", we mean it: we couldn't find anything majorly wrong with that version, so today I slapped a new label on it and sent it off into the world as &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; 2.0 Released to Web (RTW) version. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So if you've been waiting for &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; to shed its beta and RC monikers, go forth and &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=113273&amp;amp;package_id=130752&amp;amp;release_id=567643"&gt;download it from the project website&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Thanks again to Derek, John, and Nathan for their contributions, as well as to those others who have contributed since the &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; 1.8 days (sadly, I don't have a list handy). &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

Not very quickly at times, but I do at least try to put in around an hour every day. For quite a while now, that hour has become more a chore than something I look forward to. But I was committed to completing the tasks I said I would take on, so I kept going. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It’s in a good place technically, we’ve got some very competent developers still doing great work on the app, and more and more it’s someone besides me answering user emails. I feel absolutely great about the people that remain being able to maintain and improve the product. There are, of course, any number of things that I’d love to fix or add to &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt;, but the truth is that I’m just burned out. Plus, our second child is due to arrive in a few weeks, and I think it would be foolish to assume even my limited free time is going to survive that. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0in; MARGIN-TOP: 0in; PADDING-LEFT: 0in; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"&gt;&lt;font face="Calibri"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

And you've probably also noticed that as part of that experience, &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2007/07/02/47891.aspx"&gt;I learned a lot about SOAP and REST&lt;/a&gt;. Well, those lessons weren't just academic; for the last few months I've been working on the next generation of MTPS web services, and this time, they're RESTian! &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As of today, you can go out to &lt;a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/restapistubs/"&gt;http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/restapistubs/&lt;/a&gt; and see for yourself. That URL is the root of a prototype REST API that exposes basically everything that the SOAP API does, plus a bunch of other pieces of information. Over the coming months, we'll be adding more functionality to it, too, as we try out some of our ideas for MTPS web services V.next. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Before going any further, I'd like to stress that this service is a &lt;strong&gt;prototype&lt;/strong&gt;. You've probably noticed the "lab" part of the domain name in the URL. Well, we're serious: we &lt;strong&gt;will &lt;/strong&gt;be updating and modifying the service over the coming weeks. Don't count on piece of data to stay in the same place, to stay in the same format, or even to work at any given time. That said, we expect a trajectory towards increasing functionality and stability. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There are a few notable things about the new service. Aside from the obvious fact that it's REST, not SOAP, perhaps the most significant thing is that the data format is fundamentally different. Specifically, 99% of the returned data is XHTML rather than the XML custom grammars that the SOAP service returns. Do a "view source" on something like &lt;a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/restapistubs/content/b8a5e1s5/en-us;vs.90"&gt;the page for System.Xml.XmlReader&lt;/a&gt;, and you'll see what I mean. Basically, instead of using custom elements like &amp;lt;locale&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;, we've gone with things like &amp;lt;span class="locale"&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;div id="version"&amp;gt; instead. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This approach has two major benefits. The first is that you can use the service from a web browser. It won't look pretty  - the format is designed primarily to carry structured data, and only secondarily to be viewable - but you won't need to write any client software to get a pretty good idea of how the service is set up. My experience writing the service is that this is actually a &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; useful attribute. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The other benefit of this approach is that it's, well, XHTML. That is, there are certain things about the grammar that are already understood by any person or automated tool that knows XHTML. So if you see &amp;lt;a href="some/url"&amp;gt; in the data, you know right there that the item you're looking at and the one linked to have a relationship. Not only that, but you know how to retrieve it. You could achieve the same thing with a custom XML grammar, but a) why reinvent the wheel, and b) you'd probably never be able to teach existing web tools (think search engines) what your custom grammar meant. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;On the downside, XHTML is currently a little harder to work with from a client standpoint than an XML grammar designed to deserialize to an object graph. In my opinion, that has changed somewhat with .NET 3.5, and specifically System.Xml.Linq. I've written a bit about that already &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2007/09/06/48385.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2007/09/12/48439.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and may have a bit more to say about it in a future post. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'd like to call out two features that are unique to the new version of the service: tag and annotation info. If you visit &lt;a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/restapistubs/community"&gt;http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/restapistubs/community&lt;/a&gt;, you'll see links to these two sections of the website. This is data reflects a feature that's been on the MSDN website for quite some time, but that seemingly not a lot of people know about - you can tag and/or annotate items in the documentation with your own tags and comments. Check out &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.codedom.codethrowexceptionstatement.tothrow.aspx#CommunityContent"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; as one example of community-added content. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Right now, the tag and annotation data available through the REST API is "fake". That is, it's just a bunch of placeholder information, and doesn't reflect the contents of the MTPS database. That's just because we're still running with the version I developed on my laptop as we iron out the last issues with connecting the service to the live database. But it should be hooked up to the real annotations and tags before long, and you'll hear about it here when it is. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;OK, I think that's enough info for now. I'll post more before long. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>50032</id><published>2008-01-23T12:19:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-01-23T12:19:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Announcing the MTPS REST API</title><content type="html">Freaking awesome.

In this episode, we discuss &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2008/01/23/50030.aspx"&gt;the newly-launched MTPS REST API&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;

And we did. A bunch of things have changed. Mostly, I've added new functionality. I did, however, change the way one thing works in a fairly significant way, but it just makes for a good opportunity to talk a bit about how the service works. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;If you visit &lt;a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/restapistubs/content"&gt;the content section&lt;/a&gt; of the service, you'll be given a list of all the content item IDs in the system. (A content item is an atom of information - for example the documentation for one of the overloads of System.Xml.XmlReader.Read.) Right now that list is very short, because we're still not hooked up to the live database, so the bits that I can't get from &lt;a href="http://services.msdn.microsoft.com/ContentServices/ContentService.asmx"&gt;the MTPS SOAP service&lt;/a&gt;, I just make up. You can tell because they all have "fake" somewhere in the URL. Eventually, we'll list all the content items here. Not because I think that a list of all the content items is inherently useful in and of itself (although you never know), but rather because I believe that every URL in the system ought to be reachable by traversing links from the service root. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Clicking on the only non-fake content item ID takes you &lt;a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/restapistubs/content/b8a5e1s5"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This is what we call the alternates list for the content item, which happens to be the System.Xml.XmlReader content item. "Alternates" because it lists all of the available versions/locales pairs. See, every content item can exist in multiple versions and in multiple languages. So you can click &lt;a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/restapistubs/content/b8a5e1s5/de-de;vs.80"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to get the German, .NET 2.0 version of the System.Xml.XmlReader content item, or you can click &lt;a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/restapistubs/content/b8a5e1s5/en-us;vs.90"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to get the US English, .NET 3.5 version of the same document. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Once you click one of those links, you arrive at the content item page. (You can always tell what type of page you're on by examining the class of the &amp;lt;body&amp;gt; tag.) Here, you get links to all the various pieces of information that make up the content item. One of the most interesting is the Mtps.Xhtml primary document. This document contains most (but not all) of the information you're used to seeing on &lt;a href="http://msdn2.com"&gt;the MSDN2 website&lt;/a&gt; when you look up a class or method. And here's where one of the changes came in. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In the first version of the service that I posted, if you were to look at an Mtps.Xhtml document (for example, &lt;a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/restapistubs/content/b8a5e1s5/en-us;vs.90/primary/mtps.xhtml"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;), you'd find that clicking in the links it contains would jump you to the other Mtps.Xhtml documents. At first blush, this is a fairly natural thing to do, as it mirrors what happens on the MSDN2 website. However, there was a subtle problem lurking that came up, and now the service no longer behaves that way. Now, if one content item links to another in the Mtps.Xhtml document, that link takes you to the list of alternates for the target document. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This has a number of implications. First of all, it means that if you want to use the MTPS REST API as a (really ugly) documentation browser, you're going to do a lot more clicking. To navigate from one Mtps.Xhtml document to another, you're going to have to click once to get to the list of alternates, again to pick a particular version/locale combo, and then again to get to the Mtps.Xhtml primary document. Not optimal from a human standpoint it's worth mentioning that the REST API is not designd to be navigated by a human…except developers who want to get an idea of how it works. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;No, there's a good reason for this change. You see, it turns out that the underlying MTPS database doesn't actually contain version or locale information. You can see this if you use the SOAP service - that document that comes back is linked solely via something called an asset ID, which is basically like the "b8a5e1s5" (we call that form a "short ID") part of the URL for a content item. In the initial release, I actually wound up just using the locale and version of the linking document to synthesize a link to the target document. Obviously, this would break if the target document happens to be of a different locale and/or version. And it did. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;But that's not the reason we changed it. The real reason is that it's not clear that the service should be defining what the correct behavior should be. Should we always send links to the latest version? To the same version? If you think you know the answer for your scenario, let me assure you that someone else will have a different one. On the MSDN2 website, we can make assumptions about which way it should go because &lt;em&gt;it's not an API, it's an application.&lt;/em&gt; But the REST interface &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; an API. So we have to leave it to the client, which means linking to the alternates page, so the client can implement whatever policy they want - pick the latest, pop up a dialog, whatever. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I mention this because to me, it's really characteristic of the RESTian nature of the interface in two ways. First, we leverage links, rather than expecting clients to synthesize URLs based on knowledge of how the system works. It emphasizes the view of the system as a directed graph of linked resources. That has more of the "&lt;strong&gt;of&lt;/strong&gt; the web, not just &lt;strong&gt;on &lt;/strong&gt;the web" flavor that (IMO) characterizes good REST interfaces. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The other thing that it brings home is that the REST API is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a website in the traditional sense. That is, it's not that I've just built a website and decided that all my .aspx pages now have .xml siblings or whatever: the system is fundamentally designed in a different way - to expose as much of the information available in the database as possible, not to present it for human consumption. Which goes part way towards explaining my decision not to include stylesheet links in the head, too. (A post for another day, perhaps.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So this has turned into a somewhat long (and perhaps somewhat rambling) post about a service that - as far as I know - no one is using yet (tell me if you are). But as the first major REST system that I've implemented "for real", I've found the issues that come up to be enormously helpful towards my understanding of the advantages and limitations of REST. Hopefully some of you will, too. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I hope to occasionally post more information about the design and implementation of the MTPS REST API, and about the things I'm learning from it, as we move forward. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>50255</id><published>2008-02-15T05:34:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-02-15T05:34:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: MTPS REST API Updates</title><content type="html">Craig, this is great stuff and just outlines why the REST style is so great.

Details and an updated version &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2008/03/11/50418.aspx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. The download link in this entry is no longer active. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I've been a fan of the F-16 combat flight simulator &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_4"&gt;Falcon 4&lt;/a&gt; for a long time. As with most flight simulators, situational awareness (SA) can be a bit of a challenge - flying a flight simulator where your only view is the computer screen has been described as like trying to drive while looking through a drinking straw. Well, when I finished &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com" title="FlexWiki"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt;, as a reward to myself I bought a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackir"&gt;TrackIr&lt;/a&gt;. It's a head-tracking device that lets me change the view by simply moving my head. It's very intuitive and freakin' awesome - it's hard to imagine flying without it anymore. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The problem with using TrackIr is that you start living in the 3D view. That's a problem because in &lt;a href="http://www.lead-pursuit.com/products.htm"&gt;Falcon 4: Allied Force&lt;/a&gt; (F4AF), many of the gauges don't work in the 3D view. The biggest problem, though, is that the cockpit isn't clickable. So you wind up bouncing back to the 2D view all the time to toggle this or that with the mouse, which is slightly annoying. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I thought about building some sort of USB device (this sort of activity is called "cockpit building", and people spend literally tens of thousands of dollars on it), or maybe buying something, but everything I could find was either a bit on the expensive side or was going to stretch my extremely rusty electronics skills. And was going to take a hell of a lot of time. But wait! I'm a pretty good programmer! I can solve this with software. Hence were born F4Panel and KeyServer. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The basic idea I had was to transform my ancient PDA (it runs Pocket PC 2002 to give you some idea) into a touchscreen device that would emulate the major instrument panels in the F-16. It's not an original idea - you can buy a much nicer-looking version of what I wrote for $30 at &lt;a href="http://www.pocketmfp.com/default.htm"&gt;http://www.pocketmfp.com/default.htm&lt;/a&gt;. But it requires Pocket PC 2003, and my device is so old it doesn't support that. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;To make a long story short, I wrote my own. Here are some pictures of it:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://pluralsight.com/craig/images/f4panel-mfd.jpg" alt="F4Panel MFD" /&gt; &lt;img src="http://pluralsight.com/craig/images/f4panel-icp.jpg" alt="F4Panel ICP" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It works great, and I thought other people might like to make use of it, so I've posted a zipfile &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/craig/download/f4panel-keyserver-r1.zip"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There are two parts: F4Panel runs on the PDA, and KeyServer runs on the PC. Install F4Panel on the PDA by copying the appropriate F4Panel.cab file to your PDA and clicking it. KeyServer doesn't need to be installed - just run KeyServer.exe. When KeyServer starts, it'll put a very boring icon in the system tray. Right click it and choose "Load Profile". I've included a profile for F4AF, but the syntax is pretty simple and you should be able to figure out how to change it. Once you've got the profile loaded, go to the PDA and run F4Panel. Click Tools-&amp;gt;Connect and enter the name of the computer where KeyServer is running. You'll obviously need to the PDA to be connected to the same network as the PC somehow - I just keep mine in its USB docking station. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The two programs communicate by means of a very simple HTTP-like protocol: F4Panel sends something like "CLICK ICP1" and KeyServer looks in a profile file for a command called ICP1 to figure out what keys to send to the foreground application. If it sends them okay, it returns "200 OK". I mention this, because I intended KeyServer to be general enough to be used with other games (or whatever) - you'd just need to write the PDA bit that sends "CLICK &amp;lt;commandname&amp;gt;" and the appropriate profile file that maps &amp;lt;commandname&amp;gt; to some sort of key sequence. The socket code is extremely simple - you can look at the F4Panel source to see it. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Because this was a fun-time project, and because quite honestly I'm momentarily burned out on full-scale open source projects, the zipfile is just a dump of the source and binaries. I'm sure you can cope. :) Consider it MIT-licensed, so feel free to go forth and improve it. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The term "KeyServer" is a registered trademark, so I had to rename mine.

&lt;div&gt;I just got done mixing the first part of the third episode of Design and Implementation, the occasional podcast that &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/tewald"&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt; and I do. This time, we interviewed &lt;a href="http://www.iunknown.com/"&gt;John Lam&lt;/a&gt;, who is a Product Manager at Microsoft on the DLR team. John has been working on &lt;a href="http://www.ironruby.net/"&gt;IronRuby&lt;/a&gt;, an implementation of the Ruby language on the .NET platform. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Tim has been big into Ruby lately, so we had a good time talking to John. So good, in fact, that we ran fairly long. So I've split the episode in two - the first part is now ready. When I get done mixing the second part, I'll put that up too. Sorry to be a tease. :)&lt;/div&gt;

You mention the possibility of using ASP.Net MVC for your REST service... at my blog (http://www.shouldersofgiants.co.uk/Blog) I put together a sample that uses ASP.Net MVC to provide a RESTful service along the lines defined by Sam Ruby and Leonard Richardson in their RESTful Web Service book. I chooose MVC over WCF because it had the MVC support and multiple representations built in. The service I ended up with supports XHTML (easy), XML, JSON and a HELP representation. XML required my own XsltResult class. To add "connectedness" to JSON required custom serializers. HELP is a representation that returns the XHTML representation plus some extra documentation and a javascript test harness. I thought this was a good way to allow developers to explore how the service works / reacts more fully than the plain XHTML representation. Skip to entry 16 for a version that works with MVC 1.0. Just going to listen to the dynamic language bits now!</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="50317"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>50392</id><published>2008-03-07T06:58:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-03-07T06:58:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">DebuggerStepThroughAttribute</title><content type="html">&lt;div&gt;Here's a good one I was reminded of the other day. I was writing some code of the form we've all seen a thousand times before: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;public Foo Bar { &lt;br /&gt;  get { return _bar; }&lt;br /&gt;  set { _bar = value; }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Even with automatic properties in the latest version of C#, you still wind up writing code like this a lot. Unless you're fortunate enough to be writing code in a more advanced language…like Lisp. :) (Sorry, had to.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Normally this is no big deal, but there is one time where this construct can get really annoying: when you're debugging and the property is frequently accessed as the means to get somewhere else. In my code that will often look like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;public SomethingProvider SomethingProvider { &lt;br /&gt;  get { return _somethingProvider; }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;when I have some service that I've abstracted, maybe to make testing easier. As a result, my code has lots of calls in it like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;SomethingProvider.PerformOperation(arg1, arg2, …); &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;When I hit that line, I want to debug into it, but of course when I hit "step into" I wind up on the property accessor. It's even worse when there are multiple properties involved, as for example in code like this: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;SomethingProvider.PerformOperation(OtherProvider.RetrieveValue(), YetAnotherProvider.Calculate()); &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;By the time I've finished stepping in and out of that, I'm all, "Aargh! Just take me to the code!" Luckily, there's an attribute that lets you skip all these piddly statements: DebuggerStepThroughAttribute. You use it like any other attribute - apply it to a method, a whole class, or a property accessor. Note that you &lt;strong&gt;can't&lt;/strong&gt; apply it to a property as a whole - it has to go on the individual getters or settors, like so: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;public SomethingProvider SomethingProvider { &lt;br /&gt;  [DebuggerStepThrough]&lt;br /&gt;  get { return _somethingProvider; }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Put enough of these in and stepping in to a compound expression becomes much less tedious. Yay! &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I don't think I'd recommend generally putting this attribute on anything but simple one-line properties of the form I've shown here, and even then you want to be careful: debugging is complicated, and I know I can screw up even simple property access - sometimes stepping into those things is actually useful, as it shows you that you cut and pasted one too many times and wound up returning the wrong value. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;That said, you can still set breakpoints on code you've applied the attribute to, and the breakpoints will still fire. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>50396</id><published>2008-03-07T10:08:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-03-07T10:08:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: DebuggerStepThroughAttribute</title><content type="html">I'm using Resharper, so what I usually do, is Ctrl-B to get to the function that I'm interested in, and then Ctrl-F10, to run the code upto the line the cursor is on.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="50392"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>50397</id><published>2008-03-07T10:50:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-03-07T10:50:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: DebuggerStepThroughAttribute</title><content type="html">I don't think you need resharper for that.

&lt;br /&gt;I didn't much care for Resharper when I used it - it was too invasive and painfully slow. Plus, I understand they don't support VS2008 yet, which is my primary dev environment.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, thanks for this tip!  During debugging it's easy to hit several trivial getters on a single code line before anything interesting happens, and it's driving me insane.

&lt;br /&gt;they all seem to suggest that you could "step over" code in the affected method.

They were just one of those spare-time, throwaway things most programmers do from time to time, so I didn't put a ton of thought into them. Well, last week, I got a phone call from a marketing guy at &lt;a href="http://www.sassafras.com/"&gt;Sassafras Software&lt;/a&gt;…it seems I should have put a bit more though into at least the names. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;See, one of the bits I published, I called KeyServer. I called it that because it's a little TCP listener that receives events and sends keystrokes to the active application. Of course, it's also &lt;a href="http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;amp;state=k7lokf.2.1"&gt;a registered trademark of Sassafras Software&lt;/a&gt;. Oopsie. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The marketing guy was pretty nice about it. He never said anything about legal action. But here's the thing: US Trademark law says you have to actively defend a trademark, or you lose it. That means that if you &lt;strong&gt;don't&lt;/strong&gt; sue the people who use your trademark, a competitor can come along and point to that behavior as proof that you don't want your trademark and that it should be taken away. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;On the one hand, it was somewhat shortsighted of me to name my software "KeyServer". I mean, that was practically guaranteed to be trademarked. On the other hand - subjectively and emotionally - it's never fun to be threatened with legal action, even when it's done politely and when you know that the person delivering the news has no choice about it. Lesson learned, I guess. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;On the bright side, it was good motivation to add a few features that I've been meaning to get around to. So I'm re-releasing the software under the name "Keylay" (it's a &lt;em&gt;keystroke relayer&lt;/em&gt; - get it?). Here are the new features: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A name that won't get me sued!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a less-boring tray icon that changes colors based on whether or not a profile is loaded, whether or not a client is connected, and animates when keystrokes are being relayed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Takes a command-line argument that is the path to a profile to be loaded at startup. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;While I was at it, I also updated F4Panel a bit. In addition to the ICP and the MFDs, I also added an "Aux1" panel that gives access to touchscreen controls of a few miscellaneous things like landing gear, the autopilot, the ECM and RWR, the laser, and the master arm switch. In addition, I made it remember the last address it connected to, since that was driving me nuts. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;You can download the updated binaries and the source &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/craig/download/f4panel-keylay-r2.zip"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>50419</id><published>2008-03-11T06:26:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-03-11T06:26:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: My First Trademark Violation</title><content type="html">FWIW - Keylay is a better name ... pretty cool, even!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The most concise way I've heard trademark law described is that it gives the trademark holder OFFENSIVE rights. A trademark doesn't DEFEND you against anything ... it merely gives you the right to go after people who use it. And as you mentioned, if you don't go after those people, you will ultimately lose those offensive rights.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And of course ...

And if you continue to use this name, I bet you would receive additional calls....

Don't be fooled, deciding not to formally defend your trademark in court will not cause you to lose a trademark.  Not defending a trademark at all will cause you to lose it.

I would suggest that the phone call could be pointed to in court as an initial effort to request that you cease and desist from using the registered trademark, if it ever actually went to court on your challenge to use the Trademark.....

Susan tipped the scales at a hefty 8 pounds, 14 ounces (4.03kg), and she and her mother are both doing extremely well. Big sister Ellen is very happy and proud as well. &lt;/div&gt;

There were a pair of "the new replaces the old" moments. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The first event was the one Larry Jordan amusingly subtitles "&lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/innovation/archive/2008/04/29/msdn-highlander-there-will-be-only-one.aspx"&gt;There will be only one!&lt;/a&gt;" What happened was, the old MSDN finally got turned off - the MTPS-based version of MSDN is now the only version running. &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com"&gt;http://msdn2.microsoft.com&lt;/a&gt; now redirects to &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com&lt;/a&gt;. That means no more fun URLs like &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/programmersguide/shell_basics/shell_basics_extending/fileassociations/fileassoc.asp" title="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/programmersguide/shell_basics/shell_basics_extending/fileassociations/fileassoc.asp"&gt;&lt;font face="Verdana"&gt;https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/programmersguide/shell_basics/shell_basics_extending/fileassociations/fileassoc.asp&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Now it's &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb776847.aspx" title="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb776847.aspx"&gt;http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb776847.aspx&lt;/a&gt;. Ahh - that's better. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Since I helped write the Microsoft/TechNet Publishing System (MTPS), which sits behind the new, one-and-only MSDN website (and the TechNet and Expression websites, for that matter), it was sort of cool to see it "take over". &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The other thing we did yesterday was to update &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2008/01/23/50030.aspx"&gt;the MTPS REST API&lt;/a&gt;. It's still very much a prototype (i.e. things are broken) but we wanted to push a version out there that has some of our latest thinking in it. Most notably, this release sketches out what we think we want to do for writes. That's right - we intend to support community-authored changes to MSDN (the website supports that now in the form of tags and wiki-like annotations, in case you didn't know). &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Although I should point out that the writes aren't implemented yet in the REST API because we haven't fleshed out the story for authentication.  But you can see the idea. For example, to add a new tag to an item you'll be able to PUT to &lt;a href="http://labs.msdn.microsoft.com/restapi/content/b8a5e1s5/en-us;vs.90/tags/add-tag"&gt;http://labs.msdn.microsoft.com/restapi/content/b8a5e1s5/en-us;vs.90/tags/add-tag&lt;/a&gt;. And to delete a the foo tag added by user candera you'd DELETE &lt;a href="http://labs.msdn.microsoft.com/restapi/content/b8a5e1s5/en-us;vs.90/tags/foo/users/candera"&gt;http://labs.msdn.microsoft.com/restapi/content/b8a5e1s5/en-us;vs.90/tags/foo/users/candera&lt;/a&gt;. For convenience, we're also planning to support POST to those endpoints with a hidden form parameter of _method, which is set to PUT or DELETE as appropriate. It's just too convenient to be able to drive the service from a browser during development not to do that. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Another big change is what lives at &lt;a href="http://labs.msdn.microsoft.com/restapi/content"&gt;~/content&lt;/a&gt;. In this release it's a link to the &lt;a href="http://labs.msdn.microsoft.com/restapi/sites"&gt;~/sites&lt;/a&gt; part of the API. In MTPS parlance, a "site" is the host part of a URL (e.g. the "msdn" in &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com&lt;/a&gt;). Underneath those are "iroots", which is a lot like a vdir (e.g. the "academic" in &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/academic"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/academic&lt;/a&gt;). The reason ~/content links to ~/sites is that via ~/sites you can find your way into the TOC tree of any of the content in MTPS…or at least you could if it were hooked up properly everywhere. Still, you can see the idea. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;That said, we've decided that the link to ~/sites is ugly and we hate it. :) So we'll have to figure something else out there. Maybe a set of virtual TOC nodes that unifies all the TOCs - one node to bring them all and in the API bind them. Or something - we're still noodling on that one. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Other changes: we've added ETags and Expires headers to all resources (currently everything is hardcoded to expire 24 hours in the future), fixed some of the encoding problems, added an XHTML DTD where appropriate, and of course there are the obligatory bunch of minor bugfixes. We've also done some slight reorganization of the URLs to fit our evolving understanding of the model, but most things have remained unchanged. I'm curious to hear if anyone has played with the service at all - if you have any questions or feedback, do feel free to &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/contact.aspx"&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>50815</id><published>2008-04-30T19:25:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-04-30T19:25:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: MSDN Updates</title><content type="html">Your use of PUT to .../tags/add-tags is broken.

&lt;br /&gt;I also like the idea of using /tags as the add endpoint, although I need to think through whether there are any issues with that. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;/tags/{tag-name} isn't an option because I'm not sure that the tag the user chooses is going to be the ID we wind up using the the URL. Happens to be now, of course.

I can't say I've figured out what &lt;a href="http://altdotnet.org"&gt;ALT.NET&lt;/a&gt; is supposed to mean, but the DC version appears to equate to smart people talking about interesting things, so that's good enough for me. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Anyway, I shot off my mouth (big surprise!) about how cool I think Lisp is at the last couple of meetings, so I figured it might not be a bad idea to offer to do a somewhat more structured talk about it some time. I don't really do much public speaking any more, but I happen to have a little presentation ready about what I've learned about (and from) Lisp, so I offered to give it and they accepted.

One of my more successful efforts in that area has been &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig/HoboCopy.html"&gt;Hobocopy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Like most (really, all) software, it's not done. There are any number of things I'd like to add to it, and I still get occasional requests from people for enhancements or bugfixes. But, due to one thing and another, I just haven't been able to get around to doing any work on it for months. So I'm asking you, dear &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lazyweb"&gt;LazyWeb&lt;/a&gt;, if you know of anyone who would be interested in adopting this poor, neglected, digital offspring of mine. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'm open to whatever arrangement that maintains the MIT nature of the license, so if you'd rather move the code somewhere else or transfer the copyright, that's cool with me. Or we can keep it where it is and I can set you up as a contributor. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Hobocopy is written in C++. Not very good C++, mind you, but C++ skills are still required. Although with sufficient work, we could probably factor out the bit that needs to be in C++ and rewrite everything else in C#. I'm happy to help with design direction via email, I just don't have time to hack. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Anyway, let me know if you're interested. It's a good tool and I'd love to see someone pick it up and move it forward. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>19</thr:total></entry><entry><id>52230</id><published>2008-07-26T12:24:16.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-07-26T12:24:16.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Hobocopy Needs a New Daddy (or Mommy)</title><content type="html">How does this work?

Hobocopy has no GUI, and as such isn't really intended to be used by simply double-clicking on it. 

Yes, the documentation sucks. Sorry about that. To get started, try firing up cmd.exe and doing something like this: 

hobocopy /r C:\directory\I\want\to\copy\from C:\directory\I\want\to\copy\to 

Obviously, replace those fake directories with the ones you want to use.

IIRC, there's a bug in Hobocopy around dealing with paths with spaces in them. A workaround is to use subst or linkd to create an alias to the directory you want to back up. E.g.

Another easy solution is to use DOS like alias names reducing long names to 6 characteres + "~1" (as "1" the sequence of similar names). 
I.e. instead "C:\documents and settings", use "C:\docume~1\..."
instead "C:\Program Files\Apple Software\...", use "C:\Progra~1\AppleS~1\...

Here a full example:

hobocopy /recursive /incremental /statefile=C:\Backup\LastBackup.dat /verbosity=0 /y /skipdenied C:\Progra~1\HIMSA\NOAHSy~1\Database C:\Backup\DataBackup\Noah

Note that you might need to install the 64-bit C runtime (vcredist_x64) in order to get it to work. Both the updated binaries and vcredist_x64 are available at &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=117783&amp;amp;package_id=204974"&gt;the SourceForge download page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Enjoy! Of course, if you &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; like hobocopy, maybe you'd &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2008/05/23/51041.aspx"&gt;consider becoming the maintainer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author></entry><entry><id>51219</id><published>2008-06-26T10:17:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-06-26T10:17:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">MSDN Low-Bandwidth Rendering Option</title><content type="html">&lt;div&gt;One of the common complaints with &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com"&gt;the MSDN website&lt;/a&gt; is the fact that the pages are pretty fat. The team has done a lot to make this better, but there's still some stuff in there that not everyone needs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;If you're interested in an extremely skinny version of the MSDN docs, give the new LOBAND rendering format a try. To use it, stick (loband) - inlcuding the parens - at the end of an MSDN URL, before the .aspx. For example, the documentation for System.Xml.XmlReader is normally at &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xmlreader.aspx"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xmlreader.aspx&lt;/a&gt;. But if you surf instead to &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xmlreader(loband).aspx"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xmlreader(loband).aspx&lt;/a&gt;, you'll get the new, low-bandwidth rendering of the page. There's a link at the top of the LOBAND rendering that lets you make it permanent via a cookie (you can turn it off later via a similar link). &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It makes quite a difference. On my machine, I see the regular version at about 98KB, and the LOBAND version at just over 18KB - and the 98KB doesn't count the TOC tree, which doesn't render in the LOBAND version. Not a huge deal for those on high-bandwidth connections in the US, perhaps, but there are lots of people who don't fit that description. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Note that the team already has planned improvements for the next regular update of the site. But don't let that stop you from letting them know if you have any ideas about how to make it better. You can drop a comment here or &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/contact.aspx"&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt; - I'll make sure it gets sent on. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;And no, I didn't have anything to do with implementing this - I'm just blogging it. :) &lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>48</thr:total></entry><entry><id>51220</id><published>2008-06-26T21:08:58.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-06-26T21:08:58.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: MSDN Low-Bandwidth Rendering Option</title><content type="html">You mean "those on high-bandwidth connections in South Korea".

type="html">&lt;p&gt;You’ve seen me talk here before about the fact that I have been lately fascinated with Lisp. Sadly, I haven’t been able to spend the time I’d like with it, but I continue to read and think about it. And I’d really, really like to put in some serious time writing a real app (better: several) in Lisp. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So it was with great interest that I read &lt;a href="http://www.lispcast.com/drupal/node/54"&gt;Lisp, too, is mainstream&lt;/a&gt;. I like pretty much everything that &lt;a href="http://www.lispcast.com/drupal/blog/1"&gt;Eric&lt;/a&gt; has written, and &lt;a href="http://www.lispcast.com/drupal/node/3"&gt;his LispCast screencasts&lt;/a&gt; are good, too. This article starts with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_Tenth_Rule"&gt;Greenspun’s Tenth Rule&lt;/a&gt; (“Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp”) and extends it to a rather different conclusion: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;My point is that it may be too late to start with Lisp so you don't have to reimplement all of its features. Because all of those new languages have already implemented them. At least what most people consider the important ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;                                        &lt;p&gt;Or put another way: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I guess my point, through all this meandering, is that other languages did borrow a lot from Lisp. About half of it. And now those features are out there, in the world. And in the meantime, while they were borrowing, they got some new features of their own. Features like giant user bases, gazilions of libraries, corporate support, standards bodies. So Lisp has half of the features of Python. Java and Python are far from my ideal language---but so is Common Lisp. The idea that I would have to implement so much of Lisp on my own is a little overblown these days. And speaking of reimplementation: How much of Python's standard library does a complex Lisp program reimplement? How much of Python would you have to reimplement before you regret choosing Common Lisp?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And speaking specifically to macros, which I currently see as the single biggest weakness of C# when compared to Lisp: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Macros let you subsume more code into less code. Macros let you write more functionality with fewer lines. Macros let you abstract away boilerplate into new syntax.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;But the corporate manager will say: if everyone writes their own syntax, my programmers can't read each other's code. So instead of having to learn a language once, they will have to learn a new language each time they approach a program for the first time. And the value of macros is lessened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s enough to take the wind out of an aspiring Lisper’s sails. :) However, I haven’t given up yet. I have two questions that I still need to answer for myself before I draw any conclusions of my own. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Is the value proposition of macros (i.e. custom syntax/DSLs) different for small teams? And particularly for stuff I read and write only for myself? Because I’ve got a lot of code that falls into those categories. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Is the library situation really so dire? I find that I don’t actually wind up using third-party libraries all that much in C#, so either the BCL is extremely complete or the types of problems I’m solving are just naturally self-sufficient. Or I’m doing something wrong. :) Besides, when I cruise the Lisp sites, I actually see &lt;strong&gt;lots&lt;/strong&gt; of libraries I could use. But maybe there’s some critical functionality that I’d have to write myself that would take a long time.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, the answers to these questions are inherently highly subjective. Like pretty much any question touching on programming tools. If I can find a way to go write a fair amount of Lisp, I’ll get my answers. They will, however, be &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; answers. I’ll share them with you if I ever get there, but don’t expect them to help &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; much. :) &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>51710</id><published>2008-07-10T05:00:55.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-07-10T05:00:55.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Lisp, Too, Is Mainstream at  A Better Half</title><content type="html">Pingback from  Lisp, Too, Is Mainstream at  A Better Half</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="51609"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>51790</id><published>2008-07-10T21:52:06.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-07-10T21:52:06.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Lisp, Too, Is Mainstream</title><content type="html">My understanding is that the biggest problem with Lisp libraries is the lack of portability.

1. Yes. I don't use macros much per se, but I do use a lot of 'dynamic code generation'. I.e. create terse populated data-structures (w/ functions if that's useful) describing your model and then process that to return a more functional model and then operate with that.

2. No. You need file system and db connectivity. And maybe mail, http and xml. FSO, ADO, CDO, XmlHttp and MSXML. And office automation. Done!

Not really.  I've worked on Python in large teams, and had all kinds of problems (when programmers don't run unit tests, or don't even write them).  Don't be misled by the fact that macros+functions are more powerful than functions.  "Why can't I apply #'AND and #'OR?" is a Lisp FAQ, i.e., even some Lisp programmers don't realize when they're using a macro or a function.

If your macros are so poorly-conceived that somebody reading your code can't understand anything, then chances are your functions are similarly poorly-designed.  (If you're truly lost, just run MACROEXPAND on the sucker!  Functions can't even do that.)  I guess macros make a convenient scapegoat.

2. As always, it's not as bad as you fear, but not as great as you hope.  Some Common Lisp libraries I've used are so awesome they have no equal in any language on any platform.  Others are worse, and all the way down to "awful".  It's not really any different than any other language -- there's just a different set of strengths and weaknesses spanned by the set of libraries.

And I don't think I've ever used a Lisp library that didn't work equally well in CLISP and SBCL, and claim to also work in several others, so I don't know what portability issues Eric is referring to.  I'm sure there are concerns around the edges, but it's certainly not common.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="51609"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>54137</id><published>2008-10-29T05:33:12.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-10-29T05:33:12.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Lisp, Too, Is Mainstream</title><content type="html">Thanks for your comments: as always, the situation as reported by someone who has actually worked with Lisp seems quite different than the perceptions of those who have not.

Right now the most interesting Lisp to me (indeed, the most interesting language) is Clojure. Since it runs on the JVM, and is a single language rather than a language family, platform issues are essentially nonexistent.

In fact, this is one of the (very, very) few things I miss about C++. Of course, Lisp does it in a much more powerful way using something called generic functions. See &lt;a href="http://gigamonkeys.com/book/object-reorientation-generic-functions.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://gigamonkeys.com/book/object-reorientation-classes.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a great description of generic functions in Common Lisp – it’s one of the cooler parts of Lisp, in my opinion, especially for someone like me who has come from a C++/C#/Java OO background. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although not a tool for every occasion, and somewhat against the spirit of &lt;a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/post/Inherit-to-Be-Reused2c-Not-to-Reuse.aspx"&gt;Inherit to Be Reused, Not to Reuse&lt;/a&gt;, mixins are nonetheless handy at times. Since mixins are generally implemented via multiple inheritance, they haven’t really been an option in C#…until extension methods came along. Now you can do something like this: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;using System; &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;public interface TellNameMixin      &lt;br /&gt;{       &lt;br /&gt;    string Name { get; }       &lt;br /&gt;} &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;public static class MixinImplementation      &lt;br /&gt;{       &lt;br /&gt;    public static void TellName(this TellNameMixin subject, string prefix)       &lt;br /&gt;    {       &lt;br /&gt;        Console.WriteLine("My name is: {0}{1}", prefix, subject.Name);       &lt;br /&gt;    }       &lt;br /&gt;} &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What we’ve done is to define an interface type and a corresponding extension method that adds functionality to that interface. Since any number of interfaces can be implemented on a type, we can apply our mixin to classes that have no other type relationship, or that already have a base class. Like this: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;public class Craig : MarshalByRefObject, TellNameMixin      &lt;br /&gt;{       &lt;br /&gt;  public string Name { get { return "Craig"; } }       &lt;br /&gt;} &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;public class Program      &lt;br /&gt;{       &lt;br /&gt;  public static void Main()       &lt;br /&gt;  {       &lt;br /&gt;     Craig craig = new Craig();       &lt;br /&gt;     craig.TellName("Mr. "); // Prints “Mr. Craig”      &lt;br /&gt;  }       &lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;                        &lt;p&gt;The best part about this is – as with all reuse mechanisms – there’s only one place where I have to change how TellName works. Obviously, if the Craig class was the only class I was extending, I could skip the mixin class and just use extension methods directly. But if I have additional types that I want to add this functionality to, and if those classes have no other type relationship (a situation I found myself in just today) then this might be handy. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyway, it’s not something you’ll use every day, but it’s worth knowing about. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>12</thr:total></entry><entry><id>51677</id><published>2008-07-09T10:17:25.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-07-09T10:17:25.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: C# Mixins</title><content type="html">Just a minor nit...in Common Lisp, they're called generic functions.

For example, storing state on a per-instance basis is difficult - you need to use a dictionary-based approach, but deal with WeakReferences and stuff to avoid keeping objects alive. Mixins based on extension methods cannot introduce additional interfaces to a class. In contrast to C++ mixins, they cannot override base class methods, and target classes cannot override mxin methods. And they can only access public (interface) members of the mixed type, not protected ones.

So, mixins based on extension methods are definitely nice, and especially the compiler support is awesome. However, there are quite a few features they are missing, which is why we are working on a library called re:motion mixins here at my company. We did a presentation about it at Lang.NET in January [1], and there is a homepage: http://www.re-motion.org/. The latter is, however, terribly out of date, since we are working very hard on getting our first open source release of the framework out of the door. But at least one can download a preview version.

While I’m recovering (and hoping I’ll be well soon enough for me to be able to race), I’ve got to do something to keep in shape. One of the things I do is to ride my bike on a stationary trainer in front of the computer. While that works well, it’s a pain to unlock the screen if the screensaver kicks in while I’m pedaling, as it sometimes does. So I wrote InhibitSS, which runs in the tray and will prevent the screensaver from running, and therefore the screen from locking. Here’s what it looks like when it starts up: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/craig/inhibit_2D00_ss_2D00_1.jpg" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;                              &lt;p&gt;Then, if you double-click it, it looks like this: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/craig/inhibit_2D00_ss_2D00_3.jpg" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The red X indicates that the screensaver is inhibited. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m sure there are a dozen apps just like this. But this one has the feature that I had fun writing it. :) &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>52647</id><published>2008-08-20T23:36:14.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-08-20T23:36:14.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Link Listing - August 20, 2008</title><content type="html">ASP.NET Easily build powerful client-side AJAX paging, using jQuery [Via: DotNet Kicks ] Sharepoint...</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="52630"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>52648</id><published>2008-08-20T23:37:13.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-08-20T23:37:13.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Link Listing - August 20, 2008</title><content type="html">Link Listing - August 20, 2008</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="52630"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>52917</id><published>2008-09-09T08:55:41.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-09-09T08:55:41.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Announcing Sudo for Windows</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’ve used a Unix much, I’m sure you’re familiar with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo"&gt;sudo&lt;/a&gt;, a command-line utility that lets you run things as the superuser. Not only it is very handy, but it is the basis for &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/149/"&gt;one of the better XKCD strips&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sudo is one of those things I find myself wishing for in Windows, especially given the new(ish) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control"&gt;UAC&lt;/a&gt; features in Vista/Windows 2008. There are lots of times when I just want to run something as administrator, dammit. Typing “sudo notepad2 C:\somewhere\foo.txt” would fit the bill. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I tried &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sudowin"&gt;Sudo for Windows&lt;/a&gt;, but it made me type my password. That seemed silly, given that I don’t need to type my password anywhere else to run things elevated. There are probably other implementations of this out there, but it literally took less time to write my own than it would to crawl through all of them looking for the one I like best. All it does is execute whatever arguments get passed to it, but the program itself has the “require administrator” bit in the manifest, so the target program winds up running elevated as well. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyway, it’s in my arsenal. Visit &lt;a href="http://alt.pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig/SuDo.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to get it in yours, too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>52932</id><published>2008-09-10T03:46:05.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-09-10T03:46:05.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Announcing Sudo for Windows</title><content type="html">I don't know how your version of sudo works but if it just starts an application with the administrator bit set then it still has the UAC popup so this is good.

The only difference with linux is that when you have used sudo in the shell and authenticated then successive usage of the command prevents entering the password everytime which is not the behaviour of your tool and cannot be done either because of the way the Vista commandshell works.

The only workaround is: sudo cmd.exe and that is what I have running here. I have a shortcut that just launches a commandprompt with the run as administrator flag set.

But still a nice addition to my commandline tools.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="52917"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>53646</id><published>2008-09-25T03:27:57.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-09-25T03:27:57.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Announcing Sudo for Windows</title><content type="html">Here's my sudo batch file solution:

runas /env /savecred /user:localhost\Administrator "%*"

Use /savecred so you don't have to type password every time(only the first time). Don't forget to specify "localhost" otherwise it runs much slower.

Put the batch file into both system folder(or somewhere in your path) and start menu folder, so typing "sudo xxx" works both on the run dialog an the start menu search box.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="52917"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>53649</id><published>2008-09-25T06:39:04.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-09-25T06:39:04.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Announcing Sudo for Windows</title><content type="html">Nice - I like it.

More on that some other time, though. Anyway, I’m always looking for an excuse to write code in Lisp – any Lisp. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As I was writing some prose in emacs this morning, I got into a real flow. I started to wonder how fast I was typing…and there was my excuse! About an hour later, I had written the code below. It’s an emacs minor mode that displays your typing speed (defined as the number of times self-insert-command has been run in the last five seconds, times twelve) in the mode-line. So you can watch your typing speed go up and down in real time. Note that you can customize a few things about it, like changing the default five-second window.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My emacs-fu (and my Lisp-fu) is not all that it could be, so the code is likely suboptimal in several ways, but it seems to work, and I always hate it when people say, “I’ll post the code once I get a chance to clean it up.” To hell with that: enjoy my code for the garbage it is :).  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Courier New"&gt;;;; typing-speed.el --- Minor mode which displays your typing speed &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Courier New"&gt;;; Copyright (C) 2008 Wangdera Corporation &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Courier New"&gt;;; Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person        &lt;br /&gt;;; obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation         &lt;br /&gt;;; files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without         &lt;br /&gt;;; restriction, including without limitation the rights to use,         &lt;br /&gt;;; copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell         &lt;br /&gt;;; copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the         &lt;br /&gt;;; Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following         &lt;br /&gt;;; conditions: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Courier New"&gt;;; The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be        &lt;br /&gt;;; included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3" face="Courier New"&gt;;; THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,        &lt;br /&gt;;; EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES         &lt;br /&gt;;; OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND         &lt;br /&gt;;; NONINFRINGEMENT.

My entry in this event was so full of drama, it belongs in a figure skating vignette. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The whole thing started a little over a year ago. I’d taken a fairly long break from running, and had hit the magic weight I’d set for myself that meant I had to start again. I’m a moderately serious runner, having done it since high school. At around the same time I was starting up, my neighbor Steve was talking about starting an exercise program. I convinced him to come out with me, despite the fact that he had never really run regularly before, and certainly not seriously. It was selfish, really: a running partner a few doors down is a precious resource. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over the next few months, we slowly built up the mileage, doing first six miles, then seven, then longer and longer runs. With each one, Steve would exclaim at how he couldn’t believe he’d just run ten or twelve or whatever miles, and at how the slightly shorter one we’d done last week now seemed like an easy distance. Major credit to Steve: he stayed with it, even when we were running through the January sleet at 6AM. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cut to six years earlier. I’d just finished running &lt;a href="http://www.grandmasmarathon.com/"&gt;Grandma’s Marathon&lt;/a&gt; in a fairly reasonable time of 3:33. My oldest friend, &lt;a href="http://rengberg.blogspot.com/"&gt;Rob Engberg&lt;/a&gt;, had run the race as well, in a very respectable 3:48. I did the marathon “just to do one”, and was feeling beat up enough at the end of it to comment to Rob that I’d run one again if he beat my time. Rob is faster than me all other things being equal, but he is a self-admitted slacker, and I figured he’d never get motivated enough to train to the point where he could take down my time. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As these things do, this one sort of took on a life of its own. The years slid by and &lt;a href="http://rengberg.blogspot.com/2008/09/marathons-past.html"&gt;Rob ran a few more marathons&lt;/a&gt; but never repeated even &lt;strong&gt;his&lt;/strong&gt; old time, let alone mine. And as also so often happens, the years erased the memory of pain and I started to contemplate doing another one. Plus, I figured it wasn’t fair for Rob at 40 to be chasing a time that I ran when I was about 30. So I told him we’d reset the clock every five years. And to make it interesting, we made it more of a bet: the loser has to post a picture of himself on his blog wearing a t-shirt of the winner’s design. In a public place. (Design suggestions welcome, BTW.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So now that we’re both between 35 and 40, we’re into the second round. Rob ran a 4:07:03 this year, and that became my time to beat. So I convinced neighbor Steve to run the Marine Corps Marathon with me (and more importantly, to train for it with me). We signed up, and started an 18-week training program that culminated with the race today. That’s where the drama comes in. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Steve and I were running well. We had a &lt;a href="http://www.marathontraining.com/marathon/m_sch_2.html"&gt;good program&lt;/a&gt; and we followed it faithfully. After working out a few kinks (hint: over about 13 miles, you need to eat &lt;em&gt;during&lt;/em&gt; a run), we were even blasting through our long runs in excellent form. Then came the 18-miler. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Running the 18 miles itself was fine. We ran on Sunday morning, and I didn’t even need to take a nap like I did after some of the previous long runs. When I saw Steve across the courtyard the next day, we traded a round of, “How you feeling? Great!” Then that evening I sat down next to my daughter to read her a story, and when I got up five minutes later, I felt like someone had shoved a stack of coins under the ball of my left foot. It happened that suddenly. I immediately went online and ordered new shoes, which I’d been meaning to do anyway, and went to bed. The next day, it was just as bad if not worse, and there was some bruising on my foot. I took Tuesday off of running, but came back at it Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And the same damn thing happened – I was fine after the run, and the next day, it suddenly started hurting again. Only this time it didn’t get better. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To make a long story slightly shorter, I wound up having to take about eight weeks off of running. Several (rather expensive) visits to the doctor later, we had a tentative diagnosis of metatarsal capsulitis, which is Latin for “you hurt your foot”. I hit the stationary bike faithfully five times a week for an hour or two at a time, trying to keep up with my running. But as the weeks rolled by and I still couldn’t walk in regular shoes without limping, my hopes for competing dwindled. Meanwhile, Steve was plowing through the training by himself, including three runs of 20 miles or longer. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, finally, my foot started to feel better. Just in time, too: I was able to resume my training with about a month to go before the race. If it had taken any longer, I probably would have given up, as running 26.2 miles takes a certain amount of preparation. I was doubly glad of the timing, because I got better just in time to compete in the &lt;a href="http://www.armytenmiler.com/"&gt;Army Ten-Miler&lt;/a&gt;, which Steve and I had signed up for as a sort of warm-up race/workout. In fact, it was going to be our first longish run together. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More drama. As I walked out to meet up with Steve at 6AM on race morning, he told me that he couldn’t compete. The reason? “Dude, it feels like someone shoved a stack of coins under the ball of my foot.” Injury! Maybe even the same one! &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So now, as it were, the shoe was on the other foot. I was left training by myself, and Steve was left wondering if he was going to recover in time for the marathon. It sucks, by the way, to not know. Both of us experienced the thought that if someone could just tell us we couldn’t run, that would have been better than just not knowing one way or the other. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, race day saw us both ready to run. Unfortunately, a major miscommunication before the start meant that we never linked up during the race. So after all that, we both wound up running separately! But even that may have been for the best, as Steve ran with another neighbor of ours, and I was able to run a bit faster than I might have if I’d run with him, important because the only reason I was running the race was to screw over by buddy Rob. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The race itself sort of sucked. The weather was perfect, and it’s cool that the marathon winds through the various monuments in Washington DC, but I have to say that the course was completely inadequate to the number of people running on it. I’m not sure who thought it was a good idea to route 30,000 runners down two-lane roads, but I spent the first &lt;strong&gt;ten miles&lt;/strong&gt; dodging around and between other runners, or getting pissed at being boxed in for the fiftieth time. Fortunately, it opened up after about ten and I was able to run a bit faster, but for the first hour and a half, I was sure I wasn’t even going to beat Rob’s 4:07, let alone run the sub-4:00 marathon I wanted to. The Marine Corps Marathon gets a C-minus – definitely &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; recommended. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So after all that, what was my time? Three hours, fifty minutes, eight seconds (a pace of 8:47 per mile). Rob, who lives in New Zealand, is running his marathon in about two weeks. It sounds like he’s actually be training for this one, but that time is only two minutes short of his best ever, which he ran when we were barely 30, not nearly 40. So it should be interesting. Me? I’m hoping he runs a 3:50:09. Because it would add to the drama. :) &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>54096</id><published>2008-10-27T15:46:27.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-10-27T15:46:27.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: MCM 2008 (Or, “Take That, Engberg”)</title><content type="html">Well done!

My race is actually this coming weekend (2 Nov 2008).  I'm also running with a friend who's doing a first marathon.  He's been training hard, so I think we'll be able to run sub 3:50 pace together.  

I think I'll be writing splits for 3:45 down my arm, and motivating myself with thoughts of T-Shirt designs on those last few kilometers.  ;-) </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="54076"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>54097</id><published>2008-10-27T15:50:34.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-10-27T15:50:34.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: MCM 2008 (Or, “Take That, Engberg”)</title><content type="html">I used one of these:

Lately, that has meant &lt;a href="http://clojure.org"&gt;Clojure&lt;/a&gt;. Clojure is a new Lisp dialect that runs on top of the JVM. That means it has the power of Lisp (macros, dynamic typing, etc.) combined with the power of the JVM. The synergy reminds me of an old bumper sticker I saw years ago: “C: combining the speed of assembly with the power of assembly.” We’ve moved on a bit since then, but still. :) &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyway, you should check out Clojure. It is easily the most exciting technology I’ve seen in years…probably since I first saw .NET in June of 2000. Even beyond just being a Lisp that actually has vast libraries (one of the main complaints against Lisps of the past) is the fact that there are some truly brilliant features of the language above and beyond what other Lisps sport. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the cool things I’d heard was that Clojure will run on top of &lt;a href="ikvm.net"&gt;IKVM.NET&lt;/a&gt;, which is a .NET implementation of the JVM. I figured that if there were a reasonable story for .NET interop, I’d be able to use Clojure to drive .NET code in a REPL. A REPL is a Read-Eval-Print Loop, which is a fancy way of saying “an interactive programming command line”. It’s like the immediate window in the Visual Studio debugger on steroids, and its absence is one of the increasing number of things that makes C# painful to use as I gain proficiency in more advanced languages. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yes, I said it: C# is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; an advanced language. If you think it is, then in my opinion you don’t know enough programming languages yet. :)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Intentionally provocative statements aside, here’s how you do it: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Download and unzip ikvm.net. No installer required. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Download Clojure. I recommend grabbing the head of &lt;a href="https://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=137961"&gt;the Subversion tree&lt;/a&gt; rather than the release that’s on the website. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Build Clojure by running “ant jar” in the clojure directory. You’ll have to install &lt;a href="http://ant.apache.org"&gt;Ant&lt;/a&gt; to do this if you haven’t already. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Run “ikvmstub mscorlib.dll” to create mscorlib.jar, which will create the Java wrapper classes for the stuff in mscorlib. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Launch a Clojure REPL via “ikvm –cp \path\to\clojure.jar;\path\to\mscorlib.jar clojure.lang.Repl”. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now you have a working REPL, in which all the types in mscorlib are available to be driven by Clojure, which is most &lt;strong&gt;definitely&lt;/strong&gt; an advanced language. Here’s a very simple example (the results of running the commands are indicated by =&amp;gt;): &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;(import '(cli.System DateTime))     &lt;br /&gt;=&amp;gt; nil      &lt;br /&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;(new DateTime)      &lt;br /&gt;=&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;DateTime 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM&amp;gt;      &lt;br /&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;(.get_Now DateTime)      &lt;br /&gt;=&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;DateTime 11/19/2008 2:31:02 PM&amp;gt;      &lt;br /&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;(.ToString (new DateTime) "R")      &lt;br /&gt;=&amp;gt; "Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 GMT"&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;You get the idea. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course this is probably only useful as an exploratory tool: if I were writing Clojure for real, I’d write it against the JVM, not against IKVM.NET. But I use the excellent &lt;a href="http://www.sliver.com/dotnet/SnippetCompiler/"&gt;SnippetCompiler&lt;/a&gt; all the time now, but it’s still not the quite same thing as a real REPL, so I’m excited to have a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; REPL available. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And really, the reason I’m posting this is that I’m hoping it will be a sort of gateway drug for you, and that what this will really do is kick off your interest in Clojure itself. The &lt;a href="http://clojure.org"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; is a pretty good source of information, but you can also check out Stu Halloway’s &lt;em&gt;Programming Clojure&lt;/em&gt; book. It’s available in Beta form &lt;a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve been tech reviewing it, and even the early beta looks pretty good. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>18</thr:total></entry><entry><id>55018</id><published>2008-11-19T13:03:01.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-19T13:03:01.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: A C# REPL (in Clojure)</title><content type="html">By the way, you can omit the ikvmstub step for mscorlib.

What can you do in Clojure that you can't do in C#? Macros. Super powerful, don't exist in C#. Ditto multimethods. Ditto (convenient) dynamic binding.

Macros."

Macros are great, really, and I miss them in any language without them, but it's usually better to have the feature you add via macros present in the language directly, if it's reasonable to do so.  In Common Lisp, probably 80% of macros are written to make one or more parameters lazy, whereas in Scala you can do it by changing the type of the parameter from, say, "Int" to "=&amp;gt; Int".

"Ditto multimethods."

I don't believe in object-oriented programming.  However, you can achieve the same results through the visitor pattern, or a Dictionary&lt;Type somedelegate="somedelegate" dictionarytype="dictionarytype"&gt;&amp;gt;, etc.

"Ditto (convenient) dynamic binding."

Dynamic binding is useful for novices and for working around type system limitations.  As such it's hopefully something we don't have to use much, but anyway, it's to be added in C# 4 via the 'dynamic' keyword.

"Ditto full-featured lambdas"

C# lambdas can't return from the method they're in, or cause surrounding loops to break or continue, or goto surrounding labels.  Are these the points that make them not full-featured?

"Also, dynamic typing does not equal no typing."

Lisp is a programming-language encoding of the untyped lambda calculus.  If the untyped lambda calculus is typed, I'm a monkey in a tree.

"However, it does generally equal less "typing", as in the sort you do with your fingers."

C# isn't great at this, but does have local variable type inference and limited type parameter inference.

"Check out Clojure and/or Haskell and/or Ruby"

I like and use Haskell.  I am competent with Common Lisp, Scheme and employed programming Java, so Clojure is probably not any different to how I would expect.

I prefer typed languages to untyped ones, because I think in types.  That said, some typed languages are better than others.  I'd prefer an untyped language to a typed language without generics.

"I'll still respect you if you learn one or more of those and still prefer C#. :)"

Don't forget: 

- In Lisp data and programs are equal. You can apply data to programs and vice versa with the same syntax.

- Lisp's syntax is extensible while C# has a fixed syntax. AFAIK Perl 6 is only modern development that supports syntax extension as well.

- Lisp functions can be recompiled at runtime. It is even possible to stop at a breakpoint, fix the problem and just continue.

It' s amazing that the 50 year old language Common Lisp is still as powerful as (or even more than) the most modern languages today. They still learn and copy features from Lisp :-)</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="55016"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>55034</id><published>2008-11-20T06:57:32.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-20T06:57:32.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: A C# REPL (in Clojure)</title><content type="html">To be fair, this is more a CLR REPL than a C# REPL...</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="55016"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>55035</id><published>2008-11-20T08:11:01.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-20T08:11:01.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: A C# REPL (in Clojure)</title><content type="html">@Ricky: So, you've obviously done your homework, and come down on a different side of the issue than I have. I can respect that: you've made an informed value judgment. I like to think I've done the same. 

To your specific points: 

"it's usually better to have the feature you add via macros present in the language directly, if it's reasonable to do so."

Agreed. However, the difference between a language like Lisp and one like C# is that I don't have to wait for the folks at Microsoft to introduce said language feature. C# will eventually get macros, or more probably a crippled version of them, but I'll have to wait years for that. Plus, it'll add more syntax to a language that already has a hell of a lot of it. 

"I don't believe in object-oriented programming.  However, you can achieve the same results through the visitor pattern, or a Dictionary&lt;Type somedelegate="somedelegate" dictionarytype="dictionarytype"&gt;&amp;gt;, etc."

Sort of. Specialization on values (e.g. null) is still a nice, expressive thing to be able to do. And generics of generics of generics is extremely awkward IMO - Clojure particularly shines here due to support of map, set, list, and array literals - an example of where the language has introduced extra syntax (over and above the extremely minimal syntax of most Lisps) where it makes practical sense to do so. 

"C# lambdas can't return from the method they're in, or cause surrounding loops to break or continue, or goto surrounding labels.  Are these the points that make them not full-featured?" 

Not really - that sort of non-obvious control flow isn't something I find myself wanting very often. I guess my complaint is more with the constraints imposed by the type system rather than with lambdas per se. E.g. you can't do this: 

object o = a =&amp;gt; Process(a);

And that's occasionally handy. 

Note that the dynamic keyword they're adding won't help with this at all. 

"Lisp is a programming-language encoding of the untyped lambda calculus.  If the untyped lambda calculus is typed, I'm a monkey in a tree."

This one probably comes down to a definition of "typed". Lisp objects have a type - variables don't, a la the var keyword in C#, albeit without the type inference, which I find to be a hindrance more often than a help. 

"C# isn't great at this, but does have local variable type inference and limited type parameter inference."

Right. And the "isn't great" and "limited" parts of that are where reasonable people can come down on different sides of the issue. 

"I prefer typed languages to untyped ones, because I think in types.  That said, some typed languages are better than others.  I'd prefer an untyped language to a typed language without generics."

And for me, I find that types are often overhead. 

You really ought to check out Clojure: as I mentioned, it has support for map, set, list (of course) and vector literals, which sets it aside from most other Lisps and (IMO) removes the needs for most types. You don't get static type checking, of course, and that may be a deal breaker for you. It isn't for me. 

Also, Clojure is functional, objects are immutable (and compare by value), and has built-in support for STM. Those things might appeal to a Haskell guy. &lt;/Type&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="55016"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>55036</id><published>2008-11-20T08:13:53.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-20T08:13:53.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: A C# REPL (in Clojure)</title><content type="html">@Tim: fair enough. Worse yet, I haven't yet tried to work with generics, but it's probably truly awful to do so given the type name mangling that goes on. And I have no idea what the mapping via IKVM even looks like...

But it's still sort of handy to have this sort of thing once in a while. And @Chuck: sorry, but I've just never been able to like PowerShell. If I did, though, it would probably make a more convenient REPL than Clojure.

To whit: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I blogged a lot less this year. There are a number of reasons for that. The main one is that I’m just not as interested in blogging as once I was. I think that comes with the increasing “inward focus” my career has taken. I just find that more and more, what matters to me is what matters to &lt;strong&gt;me&lt;/strong&gt;, not what matters to everyone else. That’s not a judgement or a boast, just an observation. It’s quite liberating: for example, I can go look at weird languages (see below) and not worry about it too much. :) &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you really can’t get enough Craig, you can always try me in appetizer size over on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/craigandera"&gt;my Twitter stream&lt;/a&gt;. I seem better able to post a few dozen characters than a few paragraphs these days. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Career-wise, 2008 continued the shift I started in 2007 away from lots of small projects towards one big one. If I remember right, by the end of 2006 I’d worked on about seven different open source and proprietary projects, at a max of something like five simultaneously. That was too much, and I was feeling burned out. These days, pretty much all my professional time goes to a contract at Microsoft, where I’m working on the next version of Visual Studio. That has been very interesting for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that it’s related to the work I’ve done on &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/craig/archive/2008/01/23/50030.aspx"&gt;the MSDN REST Web Service&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, the most significant event of 2008 had nothing to do with web services: it was &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/craig/archive/2008/03/17/50494.aspx"&gt;the birth of our second child&lt;/a&gt;, daughter Susan. She was a cranky newborn, but has since turned into a charming and active baby. Needless to say, having two kids has really changed my life. I’m still coming to terms with giving up my free time – a painful process for me. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not that I have &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; free time, of course. If I had none, I wouldn’t have been able to train for and run a &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/craig/archive/2008/10/26/mcm-2008-or-take-that-engberg.aspx"&gt;marathon&lt;/a&gt;. But maybe I shouldn’t have talked so much smack in that post – &lt;a href="http://rengberg.blogspot.com/2008/11/auckland-marathon-2008.html"&gt;Engberg whupped me good&lt;/a&gt;, and now I have to run another one. I think maybe this time I’ll make qualifying for Boston my stretch goal. Along the way, I’d also like to run a sub-20:00 5K. That’s much more my type of thing – I’m a fast runner, not an endurance runner. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This year saw my fascination with Lisp continue and even deepen, as is obvious from a &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/craig/archive/2008/05/19/50982.aspx"&gt;variety&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/craig/archive/2008/07/08/lisp-too-is-mainstream.aspx"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/craig/archive/2008/10/07/typing-speed-mode-emacs-minor-mode.aspx"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/craig/archive/2008/11/19/a-c-repl-in-clojure.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. My latest interest on the parentheses front is &lt;a href="http://clojure.org"&gt;Clojure&lt;/a&gt;. I made one (sort-of) provocative &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/craig/archive/2008/11/19/a-c-repl-in-clojure.aspx"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about it, promised to say more, and never did. Well, given how not into blogging I am lately, I’m not sure whether I ever will live up to that promise. So go check it out for yourself: it really is an awesome language. &lt;a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure"&gt;Stu’s book&lt;/a&gt; is a good way to get started. &lt;/p&gt;                              &lt;p&gt;Here at the cusp of the new year, I don’t really know what 2009 will hold for me. I have a pretty good idea that the Microsoft work will continue for a while, but of course as an independent there’s always an increased level of uncertainty. But I like to think that it’s a rare problem that doesn’t yield an opportunity, so I’m optimistic. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the family front, obviously we’re looking forward to watching both kids continue to grow and flourish. 2009 will be Ellen’s last full year of preschool, and of course Susan will likely start walking, talking, and doing all sorts of things. We hope to take family trips to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Alaska, too. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the professional front, I really want to spend more time working with Clojure. I’ve got some ideas for some real apps I can write, since that is, after all, the only true way to learn a language or platform. Plus it gives me a chance to run Ubuntu regularly, which I’ve been enjoying as a departure from the ordinary. (Clojure runs on Windows just fine, BTW.)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;In the personal realm there are the running goals I mentioned earlier. I also hope to continue to fly &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_4.0"&gt;Falcon&lt;/a&gt;, and maybe even &lt;a href="http://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/"&gt;DCS: Black Shark&lt;/a&gt;, which looks really sweet. If I somehow magically find extra time, and the basement finally gets finished, maybe I’ll even start playing bass and/or drums again. &lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;Wishing you all the best in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>56030</id><published>2009-01-01T10:59:17.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-01-01T10:59:17.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Interesting Finds: January 1, 2009</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="56009"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>74214</id><published>2010-01-05T06:04:37.0-05:00</published><updated>2010-01-05T06:04:37.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">2009 – The Year in Review</title><content type="html">With only six posts the entire year, 2009 was my lightest ever for blogging, although I continue to be</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="56009"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>56067</id><published>2009-01-05T11:30:33.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-01-05T11:30:33.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">What Is All the Fuss About How You Can Write DSLs in Lisp?</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=2230"&gt;Chris’s recent post&lt;/a&gt;, and felt compelled to respond, despite the fact that I’m pretty sure I’m going to regret it. :) &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here’s what he says, abridged: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(when (and (&amp;lt; time 20:00)       &lt;br /&gt;                   (timing-is-right))        &lt;br /&gt;      (trade (make-shares 100 x)))&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;IMO, that's not a DSL -- that's just a set of function calls in an existing language.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;                    &lt;p&gt;The short version of my response to this is: “Yes! Exactly! That’s a feature, not a bug!” On to the longer version.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This argument, as a question of semantics, is fundamentally doomed to remain unresolved, unless someone can magically provide an exact definition of DSL that a) has no imprecision, and b) everyone agrees with. I’ll just pass on waiting for that to happen, and make my own observation: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A set of function calls in an existing language is generally preferable to a completely separate language. Particularly if it’s the language that you’re using to write the rest of your system. Sure, there are cases where using a specialized language is the thing to do, but over the last few years I’ve come to have a lot more - what’s the word? respect? fear? caution? – anyway hesitance around introducing additional languages into the development process. It’s not rare to see C#, SQL, XSLT, XPath, NAnt XML, regular expressions, and four or five other grammars floating around in the development lifecycle of a single process, and it’s got a real price. If nothing else, it means that not everyone can work on every part of the system. Throw in the fact that some of those are hard to debug, or have conflicting metaphors, or different performance characteristics, and it adds up. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So yes, one of the reasons that I’m excited about Clojure is that it’s a Lisp, and as a Lisp it is flexible enough to adapt to the point where I often don’t need a DSL.

You are blinded by your imperative mindset. 

The truth is Lisp makes it harder to tell if you are using code or data, because the two ideas are seamless.

In this particular case, Lisp provides several ways of interpreting this DSL, only one of which is regular function calls:

Second, This could also be quoted data.

Third, The DSL can also be macro-expanded into code or other data.

Not only are there multiple ways of interpreting this data, but you can combine ways, too. 

The quoted data, for instance, has the option of later being "EVAL"uated as code or it could be processed by code. If it is evaluated, you can also include other LISP operators in the DSL.

So what's the bright line between "internal" and "external" DSLs? Presumably it's the syntax. What are the units of syntax? :) 

Not that *you're* saying this, but this seems to be to be the "Lisp looks weird" argument. That's an old one, and I'm not going to try to change anyone's mind on it, despite my personal opinion that it is completely wrong. I will say that I haven't heard this one from anyone who's actually *tried* Lisp, and that it's pretty funny to hear it from anyone who doesn't also complain about XML. Again, that comment is not aimed at you. 

BTW, if you don't like that particular "DSL", there's nothing stopping you from using Lisp to express it as this: 

(when (&amp;lt; time 20:00) and timing-is-right then 
      (trade (make-shares 100 x)))

Or even 

(when time &amp;lt; 20:00 and timing-is-right then trade 100 shares)

or whatever. (See the loop macro in Common Lisp for a really interesting demonstration of this sort of thing.) As you progress towards the latter, you move closer and closer towards writing a parser/lexer, and farther and farther from the beauty of using a homoiconic language. </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="56067"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>56099</id><published>2009-01-08T06:51:22.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-01-08T06:51:22.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: What Is All the Fuss About How You Can Write DSLs in Lisp?</title><content type="html">I think all that Chris was trying to say is that using an external DSL, it is easier to make a language that is readable to a business person.

I think the idea that we're somehow going to come up with a language that is easy for a person with no programming experience to write is laughable - businesses can't even define their requirements in English, and whatever the DSL looks like, it's not going to be English. It's going to be a programming language, with variables, flow control, etc. etc. You can reduce the amount of repetition and provide convenient libraries to make it more tractable than, say, Perl, but at the end of the day you cannot abstract away the fact that you're specifying a protocol. 

Real example: SQL is a DSL. Do we generally let business users write it directly? 

Also, I don't see that external DSLs are inherently better at avoiding injection attacks. That depends entirely on the implementation. </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="56067"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>56712</id><published>2009-02-13T07:05:06.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-02-13T07:05:06.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Hard Links in Windows Do Not Update Immediately</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was pretty excited when I saw &lt;a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc753194.aspx"&gt;mklink&lt;/a&gt; appear. Filesystem links can solve a lot of annoying problems, which is why you see them used all over the place in Unixy systems. Although, like salt, the key is to use them sparingly. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Which is why I’m so annoyed that the Windows version is pretty much completely useless. Soft links are only recognized in some contexts, but hard links are the real offender. Try this from an elevated command prompt: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; cd C:\temp     &lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; echo foo &amp;gt; a.txt      &lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; mklink /h C:\temp\hard-a.txt C:\temp\a.txt      &lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; more hard-a.txt      &lt;br /&gt;foo&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So far, so good. Now try this: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; echo more &amp;gt;&amp;gt; a.txt     &lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; more hard-a.txt      &lt;br /&gt;foo      &lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; more a.txt      &lt;br /&gt;foo      &lt;br /&gt;more      &lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; more hard-a.txt      &lt;br /&gt;foo      &lt;br /&gt;more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;WTF? My hard link doesn’t update immediately? That sucks! &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From experimentation, it seems that it only updates after you’ve actually accessed the link once. Since one of the things I’d like to do is hardlink files into my &lt;a href="http://www.getdropbox.com/"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; synchronization directory, this is pretty much a non-starter – they’ll never appear to be updated, and therefore will never sync. Unless I visit every file, which is pointless, because if I was going to do that, I could just copy them. Which is what I’m trying to avoid. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m more than willing to believe I’m missing something here, but if so I don’t know what it is. My best guess is that this is a bug in the filesystem caching code (I’m on Windows 2008). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Days like this make me want to switch full-time to my Ubuntu machine. Also not perfect, but at least the novelty makes me less sensitive to its shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>56714</id><published>2009-02-13T09:06:02.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-02-13T09:06:02.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Hard Links in Windows Do Not Update Immediately</title><content type="html">Wow, weird.

I tried to understand what more.com does via Process Monitor, but I'm not sure I understand what's going on. According to procmon, more doesn't even read the file? It only does a QueryDirectory, CreateFile, QueryStandardInformationFile, and CloseFile.

Type, on the other hand, causes cmd.exe to do a ReadFile (in addition), How does more.com get the file contents without a ReadFile operation?

We were defining some extension methods on XElement and friends that make it easier to work work XHTML. Something like this: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;doc.Html().Div(“foo”).Div(“bar”).Value&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Which would pull out the text content of a div with a class of “bar” that was a descendant of a div with a class of “foo”. All well and good, but one of the problems we were trying to address is that we didn’t want to proceed if there was no div of class “foo”. A NullReferenceException would be thrown, but we wanted something more specific. So we came up with this: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="courier new"&gt;public static T OrThrow&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(this T obj, Exception e) {       &lt;br /&gt;    if (obj == null) {         &lt;br /&gt;        throw e;  &lt;br /&gt;    }  &lt;br /&gt;    return obj;         &lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="courier new"&gt;&lt;font face="Segoe UI"&gt;Which in turn allowed us to write this: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;doc.Html().Div(“foo”).OrThrow(new MyException(“no foo”)).Div(“bar”).Value&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The clever bit is that the OrThrow extension method is generic on the type it’s invoked on, and it returns that type, so you can insert it into a chained expression and you don’t lose any intellisense. And because of type inference, you don’t actually have to specify the type (you don’t have to type OrThrow&amp;lt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;XElement&amp;gt;&amp;gt;), which cleans up the expression a bit. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This approach is more general than just XHTML, of course. Really, it allows you to insert arbitrary assertions/checks into a series of chained calls using a fairly natural syntax (for some value of “natural”). Nothing you can’t do other ways, but we liked the way this came out enough to want to share it. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>57810</id><published>2009-03-18T08:32:38.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-03-18T08:32:38.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Using Extension Methods to Verify Assumptions</title><content type="html">Cool idea, thanks!

I haven't compiled this, but you get the idea. Define something similar for body, span, and whatever other tags you want, and you're off and running. You'll probably also want one that's an extension of IEnumerable&lt;XElement&gt; but does basically the same thing.

I realize that as more "smarts" are added to the loband pages, they will become less and less loband, but I sure wish they had (sticky) language filtering.  I really don't want to see long code samples in VB, C++, and J#.

Mostly I update on Twitter now (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/craigandera"&gt;http://twitter.com/craigandera&lt;/a&gt;) – it’s just easier to hurl a 140-character tidbit out than it is to write one of these posts. And I’m nothing if not lazy. But a reader posted a comment over &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/craig/archive/2009/04/02/msdn-loband-rocks.aspx#comments"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; about MSDN Lightweight Mode. I checked it out, and it’s pretty cool, so I thought I would share it here on the blog, since I know not everyone watches my Twitter feed. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyway, have a look at &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.x509certificates(lightweight).aspx"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.x509certificates(lightweight).aspx&lt;/a&gt; (for example) and see what you think. I like it. I particularly like the fact that I can view just C# code (or just VB, or just whatever), as the noise generated by seeing all the languages is probably my only complaint with the loband view, which I still love and use as my primary interface to the MSDN website.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I have no idea if this is an official thing, or an alpha that will disappear tomorrow, or what. Although I’m still doing work for MSDN, I only heard about this via the comment that Robert dropped on my blog. So hopefully I won’t get in trouble for sharing it, since I found out about it in public. :) &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Check it out and see what you think. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>71488</id><published>2009-08-06T05:23:32.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-08-06T05:23:32.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Interesting Finds: August 6, 2009</title><content type="html">Interesting Finds: August 6, 2009</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="71474"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>72222</id><published>2009-08-31T14:04:21.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-08-31T14:04:21.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: MSDN Lightweight Mode</title><content type="html">The best thing is that it remembers your language tab selection between requests.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="71474"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>73107</id><published>2009-10-11T17:08:48.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-10-11T17:08:48.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: MSDN Lightweight Mode</title><content type="html">Perfect work!, </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="71474"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>73122</id><published>2009-10-12T07:57:35.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-10-12T07:57:35.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: MSDN Lightweight Mode</title><content type="html">Very interesting site.

I don’t see that changing in 2010. Still, as is my custom, I post herewith a review of 2009, both personal and professional. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Looking back on &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/craig/archive/2008/12/31/2008-the-year-in-review.aspx"&gt;my review of 2008&lt;/a&gt;, it seems that 2009 was a year of relative stability for me. I continued to work on pretty much the same stuff: primarily MSDN, but a few side projects whenever I could wedge in some free time. And outside of work, family consumes the bulk of my time, although I still manage to run and to occasionally do something else fun (like &lt;a href="http://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/"&gt;fly the Black Shark&lt;/a&gt; – ping me if you want to join us!). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The MSDN work has remained interesting, particularly in giving me the chance to work on Visual Studio 2010 itself. That’s right, I have code that will ship in the box! Specifically in the bit that supports offline help. It was quite an experience to work on so large a project, and I’m definitely looking forward to installing the final bits when they are released later this year. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A few random highlights from the year: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;I bought an iPod Touch, which I totally love. I use it constantly, and if it ever broke I’d buy another on in a heartbeat. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://clojure.org/"&gt;Clojure&lt;/a&gt; remains the most interesting programming language I know. I &lt;a href="http://clojure.org/funding"&gt;donated&lt;/a&gt; twice in 2009, and would encourage you to do the same (donating just once would be fine). Even if you don’t care about Clojure - although any serious programmer owes it to themselves to check it out - I assure you that Rich is doing a lot to advance the state of the art in concurrent programming and is worthy of your support. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;I read &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hobbit-Illustrated-Fantasy-Classic/dp/0345445600/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1262695197&amp;amp;sr=8-2"&gt;a graphic novel version&lt;/a&gt; of “The Hobbit” to my five-year-old…four times. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;We made some progress on the basement, but am still (somewhat depressingly) not done. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;I started using &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/"&gt;git&lt;/a&gt; seriously, and think it’s pretty cool.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;I ran in a track meet for the first time since college. And didn’t suck…as much as I thought I would. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;I started playing bass again. Badly, but I don’t care. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;I saw four movies in an actual theater: Earth, Terminator, Harry Potter, Star Trek. That’s roughly four more than I usually see, at least since the kids were born. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;We did lots and lots of travel: I was away from home for a cumulative total of over two months last year, including one trip to Asia. Alice and the girls were away for around &lt;strong&gt;three &lt;/strong&gt;months if you add it up, including a second trip to Asia without me. Crazy. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As for what 2010 holds, I’m honestly not sure. On the personal front, it would be great to finish the basement. But bigger than that by far looms the shadow of Kindergarten, which our older daughter will enter in the fall. I’m sure it’ll be a big transition for everyone around here, particularly in the mornings, which tend to run on the late side most days. But we’ll handle it like we handle everything else. And I’m sure we’ll keep traveling, but hopefully not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; as much. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the work front I really have no idea. I’m continuing to work with MSDN, and that will go on for at least a bit longer, but the life of an independent contractor is filled with uncertainty, and there’s the distinct possibility I’ll have to do a fairly serious (and possibly lengthy) search for work at some point. But as I’ve said before, it’s the rare challenge that doesn’t pose an opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Good luck to you in 2010!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>74221</id><published>2010-01-05T13:50:21.0-05:00</published><updated>2010-01-05T13:50:21.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: 2009 – The Year in Review</title><content type="html">I can't believe meeting me wasn't in one of your random highlights from 2009. :)

For my purposes, I’ve found it to be adequate, and it has the benefit that I don’t need to include any additional libraries. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I recently came across one use of it, however, that took me some time to figure out. Primarily because the documentation on this feature sucks pretty bad. It’s the TestPropertyAttribute, and it’s useful enough to be worth knowing about. So I thought I would share. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you read &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.visualstudio.testtools.unittesting.testpropertyattribute(VS.80).aspx"&gt;the documentation for TestPropertyAttribute&lt;/a&gt;, your first reaction might well be the same as mine was: “Huh? That looks like it adds precisely &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; value over any other custom attribute I might write.” Because the docs show that to retrieve the value, you reflect against the test method it’s defined on, which is pretty silly. However, in experimenting, I found that there’s &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.visualstudio.testtools.unittesting.testcontext.properties(VS.80).aspx"&gt;an equally poorly documented property on the TestContext class&lt;/a&gt; called Properties that you can use to get the value of this attribute. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, if you only need a value within the TestMethod itself, there’s not much value in it, as it’s no better than just hardcoding the value within the body of the test. Where TestProperty shines, though, is that the properties for the current test are also available during the TestInitialize method. That means you can bung a whole bunch of common setup code into your TestInitialize method, and parameterize its behavior based on properties defined on the tests themselves. A little code might help demonstrate what I mean: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="widows: 2; text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; border-collapse: separate; font: medium 'Times New Roman'; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; letter-spacing: normal; color: rgb(0,0,0); word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: none; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: consolas, 'Courier New', courier, monospace; font-size: small"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;pre class="alt" style="background-color: rgb(244,244,244); margin: 0em; width: 1248px; font-family: consolas, 'Courier New', courier, monospace; color: black; font-size: small"&gt;&lt;span class="lnum" style="color: rgb(96,96,96)"&gt;&lt;br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd" style="color: rgb(0,0,255)"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; System;&lt;/pre&gt;

  Basically, we’ve got a field _thing that we usually want to leave at the default value of “default”, but in some tests we want to override to some other value. Moreover, we want to override it in the Initialize method, since that’s where we’re doing our setup that’s common across tests. – maybe we have fairly complicated setup that needs to differ only slightly in some tests. So we use the TestProperty attribute to set a property named “thing” to whatever we like. Then, in the Initialize method, we can use TestContext.Properties to check for the presence of that value and take appropriate action. 

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made the code intentionally trivial to more easily demonstrate the concept, but I’m sure you can visualize more realistic scenarios where this might come in handy. For example, I’ve used it to customize which directory my Initialize method operates on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>75264</id><published>2010-02-24T07:33:47.0-05:00</published><updated>2010-02-24T07:33:47.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: On the Utility of TestPropertyAttribute</title><content type="html">I find it hard to fathom that someone who has ever used xunit.net or any other non NUnit-family based test system in anger and tried to do without 57 attributes for doing tests couldnt find a cleaner way of expressing such variances in a test that's easier for someone who hasnt digged into the intricacies of all this stuff to grok.

And the fact that its included OOTB is balanced by having to install VS on your build server (which is supposed to stop in 2010 but not if you need to do a mstest /publish from what I've seen recently).

Are you using the Shadow task (Private Accessors) on a build server?

And the build machine is actually my dev box. Like I said in the article: this turns out to be a good setup for me, based on the constraints and conveniences of this particular project. 

I have to say I still tend to like something like NUnit better overall, but again, it made more sense for this particular project to use what Microsoft has provided. At the same time, I don't understand your characterization of this as particularly hacky. That's a fair cop for some of the other crap in the VS testing stuff, but this one isn't too heinous from where I sit. Can you explain what you mean - I'm curious to hear your perspective. 

I'm not using the Shadow task, but again, my build "server" has VS installed on it. Which I 100% agree sucks as a general solution. 

Of course, I find pretty much everything in the C# world heinously hacky compared to my latest love, Clojure. :) </content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="75262"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>75266</id><published>2010-02-24T08:31:59.0-05:00</published><updated>2010-02-24T08:31:59.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: On the Utility of TestPropertyAttribute</title><content type="html">I listen to PSCast (and its earlier aborted predecessor!) so am well aware of your sensibilities and depth of thought.

Tests as described in the Osherove book (for all its faults) and the Meszaros book (which is excellent) and many other places should be as short as possible and rely on as little out-of-band trickery as possible.

Attributes are the very epitomy of OOBT. Arguably NUnit went too far with them. MBUnit and NUnit defintely did. xunit.net rolls back a lot of this "oh, just read about these 53 attributes and 20 helper bits (SyntaxHelpers.Is, TestClassInitialize vs TestInitialize, Assert.Ignore, Assert.Fail) and you'll be ready to write your first test.

Having to put

  // Note that we have to have a TestContext, and it must
  // be named TestContext
   public TestContext TestContext { get; set; }

in a part of your code that is as important as any other part of your codebase is a Bad Thing as people have to understand what it is and dumping auto-generated junk in a #region is not free - there is a tax for it being there in terms of having to skip over it (or understand it before deleting it when you port to xunit.net :P)

Thus I'd favour an explicit call to SetThingNonDefault instead of something that leans on:
- adding yet another attribute and the tax it represents to the overall set of thing you have to understand before writing tests
- strings
- hard-wired names
- comments to justify stupid things like hard wired names
- 20 lines of code including lots of stuff that can fall out of sync (comments, strings)
On the plus side, there's a lot to be said for declarative things over imperative in general.

Adding something like this makes it massively over-engineered.

I'm not disputing that this is a cool trick to be aware of if you're on the road to MSTest nirvana.

But, like some of the stuff in WinForms. the fact that this sort of trickery and magic is considered a good idea is a Bad Smell. It breeds people thinking there must be a magic answer if only they could find the Bingoogle keyword for it.

I'm confident I dont need to explain why the Shadow task (testing privates) is bad news. I just wanted to point out that in addition to being bad news in general, it specifically falls over on build servers randomly and very frustratingly.

I dont know if you've spent a lot of time with xunit.net, but its a seriosly nice piece of kit and I realised that pretty quickly (before reading Meszaros, Osherove and the PragProgs Unit Testing book -- all of which allude to reasons why).

In xunit.net, if you had a need of this nature, you'd build a custom FactAttribute if this was indeed a real widespread need which was making your test code ugly and hard to fathiom in many places. The diff is that xunit.net wouldnt have got any more complex to grok and your test code wouldnt be as long and ugly at the end of the exercise.

First, you're right about the magic TestContext property sucking. I hate it, and the comment is there because my first instinct was to name it Context, which didn't work. 

I also agree that a method like SetNonDefaultValue would be preferable. And I would have used that approach, but it wasn't actually possible in the case that sent me down this road: the custom value is used smack in the middle of the initialization code. And for better or for worse, we have been taking the approach that [TestInitialize] is preferable to calling Initialize() at the beginning of each TestMethod. I can definitely see both sides of that debate, however, and may well swing back the other way, which has been my historical preference. 

What sucks is, I'd love to be able to show y'all the code to see if you agree with my design choices in the face of the constraints I'm operating under - absent those it becomes very difficult to debate the merits of an approach. But this thing I'm working on is going open source in a month or two, so maybe we can revisit it then. And I'd love to hear then whether you think I could have improved on my approach at all. 

That said, I do agree with your sentiments. I have yet to read the books you mention (currently in the middle of "On Lisp", "Clojure in Action" and "Thinking in Clojure", so you can sort of see where my brain is), and I've never used xUnit for real, but I look forward to doing so. 

Thanks again for your insight - always very valuable to me!

The Osherove books gets you thinking (but definitely needs a pinch of salt in the same way as MSTest does).

I have no doubt that in your context this is perfectly valid. And once you've settled on a tool, I'd generally support using features and idioms of the tool in preference to finding a way of routing around it for no good reason. Point is that xunit wouldnt give you something like this to use unless there was a real demonstrated requirement for this that 
a) doesnt have workarounds 
b) justifies the tax of introducing the feature
c) is going to be widely used

The sheer number of Attributes and tricks in NUnit/MSTest/MBUnit just isnt funny anymore and luckily a latecomer like xUnit.net can dump some stuff and then be agressive about not putting new stuff in willy nilly.

Mention of TestInitalize raises the debate about the undue of conflation of fixture and testclass stuff in [MN][SB]?Unit - but you'd need to read Mesxaros for that.

I wouldnt have seen any of this without porting a suite of MSTests over to xUnit.net and reading the books.

I look forward to seeing your *real* source and am confident I'll learn from it and not be slewing ranty comments in its direction!

  //Use ClassInitialize to run code before running the first test in the class
        [ClassInitialize()]
        public static void MyClassInitialize(TestContext testContext)

            testContext.Propert.Add("mykey", 1 ) ;

Above will happily work and erase all but "offical" keys as soon as it leaves the method ?!
So if you thought this method has a TestContext instance so that one can actualy save some class wide testing value, you are wrong.

Strange thinking beyond belief ...

The difference is that you get a lazy sequence of File objects, not paths. Hooray for "batteries included"!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was playing around with Clojure this morning, attempting to write a little photo viewer application. As part of this, I wound up writing a function that produces a lazy sequence of all the files that are descendants of a given directory. I was pretty happy with how it turned out, so I thought I’d share it. Here’s the code in its entirety: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(import [java.io File])

(defn dir-descendants [dir]
  (let [children (.listFiles (File. dir))]
    (lazy-cat 
     (map (memfn getPath) (filter (memfn isFile) children)) 
     (mapcat dir-descendants 
      (map (memfn getPath) (filter (memfn isDirectory) children))))))
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The key bit here is the lazy-cat, which returns a lazy sequence – it doesn’t evaluate the second expression (in which I walk into the children of the current directory) until someone asks for the next element in the sequence. In other words, even though this function looks recursive, it’s not. Because lazy-cat returns right away, the “nested” call to  dir-descendants happens after the stack has been popped. This is totally awesome, because it means I can call dir-descendants and it’ll return right away. So I can start displaying pictures without having to wait for the entire directory tree to be enumerated. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Two things struck me about writing this code. The first is that it’s really, really compact. It would be even smaller if it weren’t for the calls to memfn, which is just there so I can use a Java method as if it were a Clojure function. The second is that it was a bit of a mind-bender to write, although having written it I find it fairly easy to read. But I suspect both of those things would also be true if I attempted to write the equivalent C# (including the laziness, probably via a “yield return” implementation of IEnumerable somewhere), although it would almost certainly be at least somewhat more verbose. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Java's listFiles returns an String[], so although your Closure wrapper may be lazy, you'll still block if the directory contains a lot of files. 

In C# 4, this is:

Here’s the code again: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;pre&gt;(import [java.io File])

(defn dir-descendants [dir]
  (let [children (.listFiles (File. dir))]
    (lazy-cat 
     (map (memfn getPath) (filter (memfn isFile) children)) 
     (mapcat dir-descendants 
      (map (memfn getPath) (filter (memfn isDirectory) children))))))&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the post, I tossed off a somewhat off-hand comment: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Two things struck me about writing this code. The first is that it’s really, really compact. It would be even smaller if it weren’t for the calls to memfn, which is just there so I can use a Java method as if it were a Clojure function. The second is that it was a bit of a mind-bender to write, although having written it I find it fairly easy to read. But I suspect both of those things would also be true if I attempted to write the equivalent C# (including the laziness, probably via a “yield return” implementation of IEnumerable somewhere), although it would almost certainly be at least somewhat more verbose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=2334"&gt;Chris Sells called me on that one&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s the equivalent C# code he came up with: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;using System.IO;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace ConsoleApplication1 {
    class Program {
        static IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; GetDirectoryDecendants(string path) {
            foreach (var file in Directory.GetFiles(path)) { yield return file; }
            foreach (var directory in Directory.GetDirectories(path)) {
                foreach (var file in GetDirectoryDecendants(directory)) { yield return file; }
            }
        }
    }
}&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think quantitative comparisons of code terseness are generally pretty silly, but - subjectively - when I look at that it seems just as compact as the Clojure version. So I stand corrected on that one. A few other observations: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chris included namespace and class statements. Clojure has equivalents for these, but I omitted them. Omitting them from the C# version would make it even shorter. &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;The C# version can actually be made &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; lazy than the Clojure one because of the CLR’s Directory.EnumerateFiles method, as pointed out by John &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net/community/blogs/craig/archive/2010/03/09/creating-a-lazy-sequence-of-directory-descendants-in-clojure.aspx#comments"&gt;in the comments to yesterday’s post&lt;/a&gt;. That’s pretty cool. I could, however, take advantage of this if I used &lt;a href="http://wiki.github.com/richhickey/clojure-clr/"&gt;ClojureCLR&lt;/a&gt; instead of the JVM-based Clojure. &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;I said that writing the Clojure version was a bit of a mind-bender. To clarify, the bendiness came from the behavior of lazy-cat, and I think primarily because I’m relatively new to Clojure. The “yield return” in the C# code – which is the key to the laziness – gave me similar pause when I first encountered it years ago. And although I’m comfortable enough with it now, the two yield return statements in Chris’s code made me pause for a moment to convince myself it would work without consuming stack. So I think there’s probably some inherent complexity in the laziness that – like many things – is no big barrier once you internalize it in either language. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I haven’t proven anything to anyone, not even myself. That said, having worked with Clojure a bit and C# a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt;, I’m still left with the impression that Clojure is generally more compact. It will be a few years before I can say whether that’s a good thing or not (or even whether it’s true), since I tend to think working with a language on that time scale is the only way to really get to know it. I will do two things, however. The first is to show you another bit of code in both Clojure and C#. First, the C#: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;private static IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; Fibs()
{
    yield return 0; 
    yield return 1; 
	
    int a = 0; 
    int b = 1; 
    while (true)
    {
        int temp = a + b; 
        a = b; 
        b = temp; 
        yield return b; 
    }
}&lt;/int&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the Clojure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;(def fibs (lazy-cat [0 1] (map + fibs (rest fibs))))&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully it’s obvious from at least one of these that they’re meant to compute the Fibonacci sequence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe someone can come up with ways to make the C# more compact: I would welcome such suggestions. And I’m not trying to have a Clojure-versus-C# contest here – those are stupid, like saying, “Which is better: a hammer or a drill press?” But language comparisons are still interesting in that you generally wind up learning something you didn’t know about at least one of the languages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing I’m going to do is to implement my slideshow app (the thing that had me writing the directory recursion function in the first place) in both languages and post them here.

It was an interesting exercise, the more so because I’m not entirely sure what conclusions to draw. I may have more to say about this at some point in the future, but for now I thought I’d just put up the code and share some general observations. So, you can find the C# version &lt;a href="http://gist.github.com/335331"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the Clojure version &lt;a href="http://gist.github.com/335332"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app is pretty simple. It starts a low-priority thread that lazily populates a list of filenames that are descendants of a particular directory. Meanwhile, a timer procedure randomly selects one of the filenames out of the ones that have been found so far and invalidates the screen. The repaint simply draws the image centered on a fullscreen window with a black background. If no images have been found yet, then it prints “Working…” on the screen instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Clojure version isn’t really an app, because I wrote all this code really quickly and didn’t bother giving it a main() function, but other than that they’re about as similar as I could make them, given that one is running against Swing on the JVM and the other against Windows Forms on the CLR. I suppose I could have written the Clojure one against Windows Forms as well using &lt;a href="http://github.com/richhickey/clojure-clr"&gt;ClojureCLR&lt;/a&gt;, but honestly it was simply more interesting to me to use Swing, as I’m not familiar with it. And this is anything but a scientific experiment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the C# version, I eschewed the Forms designer to keep it closer to the spirit of the Clojure one. And for something like this, where I’m just blasting raw pixels at the screen, I think that was a reasonable choice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote the Clojure version first. Perhaps that was a bad choice, since it meant I spent a lot more time on the Clojure one, since I had to figure out all the little details, like how to center an image in a region. It certainly made the C# version a lot easier to write, since I was pretty much just translating. But the C# version probably would have been easier for to write in any event, since I’ve been writing C# professionally for almost 10 years, and Clojure in my spare time for less than two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that surprised me a bit is that the Clojure version turned out to be not much shorter than the C# version. Indeed, if I had put closing braces on the same line as the statement they close (which is like the Clojure style I use), I’d bet they’re about the same. I had expected it to be quite a bit more compact, since, as I’ve said before, my experience with Clojure has been that it generally lets you be more concise. In this case, I suspect it has to do with the fact that I had a lot of Swing-related code, which doesn’t lend itself strongly to the sorts of concision that Clojure supports. Or it could be the fact that I’m a Clojure n00b, and just don’t know how to structure the code to hit a good balance of terseness with readability. Certainly, I could make it a bit shorter by inlining calls to things like make-frame. Other recommendations as to how better to write either version would be more than welcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both versions of the code are pretty rough, as I wrote them essentially while I was waiting for stuff to install on a VM. I’d definitely clean them up more if I were going to do anything with them, but I figured it was better to get it up here than to wait potentially forever to get it polished. Really, I’m just trying to point out that not all my code looks this crappy. :) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll note that in the Clojure version, I use an atom to store the list of filenames. That’s not because I’m taking advantage of Clojure’s awesome concurrency support, it’s because it was a convenient thing to do. Note that the C# version doesn’t bother with synchronization at all, since I’ve only got two threads, and one is only reading, and one is only appending. If I wanted to get fancier with the threads (e.g. have another thread doing look-ahead loading of the next image), then I might have to start doing synchronization. I’d be in good shape on the Clojure side then, since not much would have to change, and the fact that Clojure values are immutable really helps. I don’t think the C# version wouldn’t need too much work, but I’d have to think about it more to be sure, and it would depend on exactly what I was trying to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s apropos of nothing, but it made me smile that the C# version required PInvoke to get a fullscreen window, and the Swing one just supported it out-of-the-box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being familiar with Visual Studio was a definite benefit when working with the C# code. I’m not very facile with the debugging capabilities of Emacs/SLIME, which is what I use to develop Clojure, and when I had problems it took me a little longer to figure them out. That said, having the REPL was really awesome, and it really makes me hate the Immediate Window in Visual Studio by comparison. It would be interesting to try &lt;a href="http://www.bestinclass.dk/index.php/2010/03/clojure-ides-the-grand-tour-getting-started/"&gt;some of the other Clojure IDEs&lt;/a&gt; to see how they stack up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither version of the code has much in the way of comments. Sorry about that. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that’s my pile of unstructured thoughts. Hope it’s of interest, if not value, to at least some of you. And as I said, further discussion, rewrites, comments, and criticism are wholly welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

First of all I think you did a very very job stepping into Clojure. Though in a few places it shows that you're used to C#.

For instance do you define the sequence using a loop with side-effects, it takes an extra line to implement it in a purely functional lazy sequence, but I think its worth it. Secondly I see you add a lot of named variables which in more than a few cases isn't necessary or helpful. 

I rewrote your code to address those two issues, which brought the code-size down to about 95 lines. Then it dawned on me, that you don't need another mutable construct to determine a 'currentimage', since all you need is a randomly selected index. In addition I don't see why exactly you'd want a timer, since a future would have the exact same effect. 

So with the above in mind I added a macro to simplify some of the repetive Java interop and that brought the code down to 85 lines without loosing anything (I hope), so we're coming up on 50% of the C# code. You can read the code here:

http://gist.github.com/335511

Hope to see more from you in the near future,

Thanks for taking the time to have a look. I really like the props macro, and the rest of the cleanup you did makes sense to me, too. The idea of using a future with sleep is also nice - as you say, the timer introduces unnecessary complexity. 

Your use of when-let is an obvious "duh" now that I see it - I suppose I should always be on the lookout for an "if" where one of the clauses evaluates to nil. As you say, my C# background is showing here - like others I've found that it's not the switch to Clojure so much as the switch to functional that's difficult. 

An interesting experiment for me would be to see if some of these changes would survive the translation to C#. 

The named variables were generally there as leftovers from debugging - pasted in from intermediate steps in the REPL. Along the same lines, the C# version actually squishes compute-bounds and fit-to together, as I've got a repeated calculation in there. That would make it even shorter and (hopefully) clearer. 

All in all, it has been an interesting experiment.

Np - Fun task.

Regarding gensym then you can simply try changing to the # format and run (macroexpand-1 '(props img .getHeight .getWidth)) to see the results. You'll notice that a different gensym is generated for each iteration of the for-loop. This is intentional, though not optimal for a job such as this.

If you're interested in how the macro came to be, you can check out this thread, as a Microsoft guy I suppose you'll like it :)

I use it all the time in my C# code. But it's a relatively big library, and I've never studied it exhaustively, so from time to time I come across some neat corner of it I've never seen before. In fact, that happened just the other day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that I'll frequently write test code that looks like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assert.AreEqual(0, collection.Count()); &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or the inverse: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assert.AreNotEqual(0, collection.Count()); &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've done it often enough that I have thought I ought to write a pair of extension methods on Assert called IsEmpty and IsNotEmpty. That's probably still a good idea, but it also turns out that the Linq extension method Any (normally used to test if at least one element of an enumeration meets some criteria) also has a zero-overload method that simply returns true if the enumeration has any elements at all. So I could rewrite the above tests as: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assert.IsFalse(collection.Any());&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assert.IsTrue(collection.Any());&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;respectively. While having Assert.IsEmpty and Assert.IsNotEmpty extension methods would be better (perhaps your test framework already provides them), this is still a handy little thing to know about. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>75881</id><published>2010-04-03T17:04:26.0-05:00</published><updated>2010-04-03T17:04:26.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: The Zero-Argument Overload of Any</title><content type="html">"While having Assert.IsEmpty and Assert.IsNotEmpty extension methods would be better"?!?

Just click the download button by each module. Also, the refs module is now up. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A while back, I wrote up some slides on concurrent programming in &lt;a href="http://clojure.org/"&gt;Clojure&lt;/a&gt; that I used at &lt;a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/matthew.podwysocki/archive/2010/01/14/ann-dc-alt-net-1-27-2010-clojure.aspx"&gt;a DC ALT.NET presentation&lt;/a&gt;.

So I have. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m happy to announce the immediate availability of the first four parts of my six-part Clojure concurrency tutorial, a screencast. You can find it &lt;a href="http://link.pluralsight.com/clojure"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It is freely available, and no registration is required. The final two parts will be available in less than a week. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I wrote the tutorial from the perspective of a .NET programmer who is new to Clojure. I don’t focus on the language itself, but rather the concurrency support in it. However, I don’t assume any prior knowledge of Clojure, so we start by covering just enough language syntax to get us through the demos. From there we dive into vars, atoms, agents, refs, promises, futures, and all sorts of good stuff. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you’ve been reading my blog, you’ll know I’m a big fan of Clojure. One of the reasons for this - but not the only reason - is its fantastic support for concurrent programming. I like to say that it provides “sanity in the face of concurrency”.

Also, I find it heartening that Peter is 70% of the way to his donation goal. Thanks to those that contributed.]&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don’t blog much any more. Partly that’s just blog fatigue (I started in 2003), and partly that’s having two little kids (one of whom just started Kindergarten), a new gig (at &lt;a href="http://thinkrelevance.com"&gt;Relevance&lt;/a&gt;! Doing &lt;a href="http://clojure.org"&gt;Clojure&lt;/a&gt;!), and having just moved to a new house. But I came across something that’s a pretty interesting, and a bit too long to do full justice to on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/craigandera"&gt;my Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, in a small way, &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net/community/blogs/craig/archive/2005/01/14/4958.aspx"&gt;I helped a guy make an awesome Halloween&lt;/a&gt;. He emailed me the other day to let me know about his latest project, which is even crazier and more amazing. Check out the picture of what he’s going to try to do: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.socalhalloween.com/Images/2010/Revised_Drill_in_Driveway_PL_PM_640x480.jpg" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But he needs some help raising funds. In his own words: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Craig,&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It's me again, the guy who likes Halloween more than most humans! This was the post you did on your blog: &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/craig/archive/2008/10/01/you-think-you-like-halloween.aspx"&gt;http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/craig/archive/2008/10/01/you-think-you-like-halloween.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;If you don't remember me [&lt;em&gt;Ed: how could I forget?!&lt;/em&gt;], check out the quoted material at the bottom of this email.  I noticed that you're not blogging much lately, but you are using Twitter. I was hoping you could blog and/or tweet about a project I'm trying to do this year. I'm trying to get the word out about my fund raising efforts to build this giant steampunk drilling machine prop (see attached photo) for Halloween this year.  Someone who had emailed me on my site (&lt;a href="http://www.socalhalloween.com/"&gt;www.SoCalHalloween.com&lt;/a&gt; ) a couple of years ago created this entry on his blog:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://superpunch.blogspot.com/2010/09/help-fund-building-of-giant-steampunk.html"&gt;http://superpunch.blogspot.com/2010/09/help-fund-building-of-giant-steampunk.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;A plug on your blog (or a tweet) would really help.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;I'm using a site called "Kickstarter", which is designed to help do fund raising for any sort of creative project, using Amazon for payments. The rules are really simple: If you make or exceed your funding goal by the specified deadline, you get the money. If you don't make the goal, you get nothing.  In my case, my deadline is October 14, so there are 21 days to raise the money.  Also, people get gifts to thank them for pitching in. Any amount is helpful.  $10? Sounds great.  $20?  Even better.  $50? Say, you *do* care!&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;Please go to my Kickstarter page for Halloween 2010 to get more information, see how the fund raising works, and (hopefully) donate if you're so inclined: &lt;a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1163328321/halloween-2010-journey-from-the-center-of-the-eart"&gt;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1163328321/halloween-2010-journey-from-the-center-of-the-eart&lt;/a&gt;       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;If there are any problems with line wrapping, here's a shortened URL that will take you to the same page: &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/2879mqk"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/2879mqk&lt;/a&gt;       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I have also modified the main page of the SoCalHalloween website to carry the video, a link to the Kickstarter page, and some pictures.  It also has all the rest of the video and pictures that are always available: &lt;a href="http://www.socalhalloween.com"&gt;http://www.socalhalloween.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So if, like I do, you think this is a really great idea, consider helping Peter out with a few bucks.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forgive me, Internet, for I have sinned. It has been way too long since my last blog post. But I like to have an end-of-year post (here's &lt;a href="/community/blogs/craig/archive/2010/01/05/2009-the-year-in-review.aspx"&gt;last year's&lt;/a&gt;), so here at the end of 2010 seems an appropriate time to toss out something about what's been going on. This past year was ridiculously full, both from a personal and a professional standpoint. Any one of several of things that happened would have made the year notable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, we bought a new house and moved into it in June. I love the new place, but of course moving is always difficult, and months later we still have a significant amount of unpacking to do. By itself, moving would have been enough, but my wife and I seem to have a propensity for doubling (or tripling, or quadrupling) down. So at the same time we were moving, we did a major renovation of and rented out our old place, helped my wife's parents move, and took a cruise to Alaska. Right after that, my oldest daughter started Kindergarten, which was quite a shock to the daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously with the move, I finished up at MSDN, having helped to ship VS2010. Having spent almost all of the last decade working in .NET, it made it a great time to make a major change. None of you who read this blog will be surprised that I wanted that change to involve doing &lt;a href="http://clojure.org"&gt;Clojure&lt;/a&gt;. Clojure is a really interesting language, but also a very new one. We're seeing lots of growth right now, but of course it's a small market compared to what we hope it will be in a year or three. So I was fortunate that I was able to find some Clojure consulting work at &lt;a href="http://thinkrelevance.com"&gt;Relevance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relevance is a fascinating place. Even aside from the opportunity to do Clojure on a daily basis, I find it to be truly different from anywhere else I've ever worked. They take Agile seriously and (IMO) do it right. And where they don't do it right, well, they have a process for changing the process. It quite literally took me weeks to get used to the pace at which they get stuff done: it is a high-intensity, hard-core, hacker (in the best sense of that word) culture where they also manage to keep doing the right thing by the customer a top priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why I am pleased to announce that I will be starting there as a full-time employee on January 3rd. See, I told you that 2010 was a big year: among all the other stuff, it also marks the end of an eleven-year span of being an independent consultant. It was a great run, but I'm genuinely excited about the opportunity to work at Relevance in a full-time capacity. I simply could not pass up the chance to participate in the unique combination of culture, technology, and people. And the people include, of course, my good friend &lt;a href="/community/blogs/tewald/"&gt;Tim Ewald&lt;/a&gt;, who started at Relevance last month. This marks the fourth time we have worked together at one company or another, but the first time we've ever both been employees at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So 2010 was a year of big changes for me and my family, almost all of them good. What will 2011 bring? I have no idea, but I'm going into it in a pretty good mood. :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to believe it has already been almost over four years since I wrote 
a little tool called hobocopy. The name was a pun on the truly-awesome &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy"&gt;robocopy&lt;/a&gt;, which does a great 
many things and is a truly useful tool. Hobocopy doesn’t do a tenth what 
robocopy does, but it &lt;strong&gt;does&lt;/strong&gt; do one thing that robocopy can’t: 
copy files that are currently in use. It does that by using the Volume Shadow 
Service, which is the same facility Windows uses to create Restore Points. You 
can read more about hobocopy &lt;a href="/community/blogs/craig/archive/2006/09/20/38362.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; 
and &lt;a href="/community/blogs/craig/archive/2007/01/08/45624.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked on hobocopy for a while, but as often happens, I got pulled onto 
other things. I tried to see if someone else would pick up the torch, but was 
unable to find anyone. Still, at least some people were able to get some use out 
of it: there have been something like 100,000 downloads from SourceForge as of 
this writing, and I get regular but infrequent questions about its use. So I 
felt bad that I had let development languish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, now I work for &lt;a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/"&gt;Relevance&lt;/a&gt;, and 
they have &lt;a href="http://howwework.thinkrelevance.com/developer_narrative.html#open_source_fridays"&gt;a 
very progressive policy on open source work&lt;/a&gt;. Of course I have far more 
projects I want to tackle than I could do in a decade of Fridays, but still, I 
figured that hobocopy deserves some love. So I’ve been spending a bit of time on 
it lately. I've created the &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hobocopy"&gt;hobocopy Google group&lt;/a&gt;, and I've moved the code to &lt;a href="http://candera.github.com/hobocopy"&gt;its 
new home on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might imagine, there’s still a lot to do, but I’ll be 
chipping away at it as I’m able to. Help of any sort (including bug reports!) 
is, of course, welcome. &lt;/p&gt;

I definitely would like to get Hobocopy lib'd up - it's been on my mental list for a long time. I can think of at least three good reasons to do it. Mind making a feature request on the GitHub project page? I'd like to see how that process works for people other than me.

I guess you have to do this yourself which seems logical...

Then, of course you did publish some nice stuff over the years.
I liked the lazy enumeration of directory descendants in C#.

Note that I could easily take a couple of more posts coming from you, no offense thus said ;)

I've been spending mine on various open-source projects, like &lt;a href="https://github.com/candera/artifact"&gt;Artifact&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.logic"&gt;core.logic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/candera/reasoned-schemer"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;amp;tid=10663"&gt;The Reasoned Schemer&lt;/a&gt;. But I haven't forgotten my Windows roots entirely. One of the things I've been trying to do is to continue to improve &lt;a href="https://github.com/candera/hobocopy"&gt;hobocopy&lt;/a&gt;, the open-source backup tool I wrote that can copy in-use files. I initially released it about five years ago, and in that time it has been downloaded something like 100,000 times. In the half year since I &lt;a href="/community/blogs/craig/archive/2011/01/28/hobocopy-lives.aspx"&gt;re-launched it on github&lt;/a&gt;, it has been downloaded around 15,000 times. So clearly, people are using it, and this is a reasonably successful open source project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the project has picked up steam again I've noticed that the things people want tend to fall into two categories: 1) fixes for mysterious issues with the Volume Shadow Service that I can't do much about, and 2) feature requests around the copying part of hobocopy. I'm sort of stuck on #1, but on #2 I could actually roll up my sleeves and implement copying of streams, or correctly enabling the SE_BACKUP privilege, or any one of the myriad other things that go into correctly copying a file from point A to point B; it's a surprising complex problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or I could cheat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time now, I've been contemplating an alternate approach. Rather than have a piece of software that would make a shadow copy of a volume and then make copies out of it, I thought it would be handy to have a piece of software that would simply make a shadow copy, temporarily make it available on some drive letter, and then run an arbitrary command [1].  If that arbitrary command happens to be &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy"&gt;Robocopy&lt;/a&gt;, then you've got all the advanced copying ability you could ever want. But you could just as easily use notepad if all you wanted to do was look at a file that was locked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus was born &lt;a href="https://github.com/candera/shadowspawn"&gt;ShadowSpawn&lt;/a&gt;. I worked with the ever-excellent &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/kwolk/"&gt;Kim Wolk&lt;/a&gt;, and this last Friday we got everything to the point where it works reasonably well. We've slapped a 0.1.0 version label on it and made it available for &lt;a href="https://github.com/candera/shadowspawn/downloads"&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not using it in my nightly backups at home yet, the way I do with hobocopy (I plan to make the switch soon), so consider it to be beta: we expect issues, but it should generally work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a simple example of how to use it: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;shadowspawn C:\some\directory Q: robocopy Q: D:\some\other\directory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would snapshot your C: drive, mount the snapshotted version of C:\some\directory at Q:, run the robocopy command against it, and remove the Q: mapping when robocopy finished. More details are available at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/candera/shadowspawn"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we hope you find it useful. Feel free to ask for help on &lt;a href="mailto:shadowspawn-tool@googlegroups.com"&gt;the mailing list&lt;/a&gt;, or to make a feature request or bug report on &lt;a href="https://github.com/candera/shadowspawn/issues"&gt;the issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] Indeed, a tool called &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb530726(v=vs.85).aspx"&gt;VShadow&lt;/a&gt; lets you do exactly that, albeit in a slightly different way. But I had additional reasons for wanting to take on this project. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>craig-andera</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>101434</id><published>2011-07-27T05:35:49.0-05:00</published><updated>2011-07-27T05:35:49.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Announcing ShadowSpawn</title><content type="html">Nice.
