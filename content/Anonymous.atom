You know that. But I'm the first to admit that it hasn't been the easiest thing for developers to use. I think the main usability issue stems from not being able to visualize what happens to a message as it enters, passes through, and leaves the system. There are numerous moving parts that come into play such as ports, adapters, pipelines, maps, subscriptions, etc, and they're configured across different controls and dialogs. This makes it difficult to approach a particular system and figure out what's going on without spelunking around the different UI's and stitching the overall configuration together in your head. Enter the BizTalk Solution Designer. This BizTalk Solution Designer gives you precisely what was missing before: a higher-level graphical view showing how messages pass through the system from start to finish. I heard this was in the works several months ago and have been dying to see it ever since. They unveiled it at PDC and also produced this Channel 9 video to give everyone a taste of what's coming. I'm impressed…check it out.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>15376</id><published>2005-10-06T19:37:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-10-06T19:37:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: BizTalk Solution Designer: A First Look</title><content type="html">This was a first look circa 2003 - any chance of some BTS 2006 functionality?</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="15371"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>19335</id><published>2006-02-28T13:15:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-02-28T13:15:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Live from Campsight</title><content type="html">Here's another test.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author></entry><entry><id>72496</id><published>2009-08-26T11:38:16.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-08-26T11:38:16.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Code Cast 30 – Story Teller with Jeremy Miller</title><content type="html">The venerable Jeremy Miller joined us to talk about YAIJMOSP (Yet Another Impressive Jeremy Miller Open Source Project).

It isn’t exciting. It isn’t very fulfilling. It just costs time and money. 
Also, it is something that needs to be done.
So, can we make exception logging as frictionless as possible?

Roll your own logging library.
Repeat the same code a lot in your application calling your library.
