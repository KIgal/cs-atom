&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;netsh int ip set addr lo static 192.168.0.23 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.1 1&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;netsh int ip set dns lo static 4.2.2.4 primary&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;netsh int ip set addr lo dhcp&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;netsh int ip set dns lo dhcp&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I use have a set of batch files that use commands like these for commonly used ip addresses).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...but did you know that when you're having problems with your IP address, the diags mode in NETSH.EXE simply rocks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;netsh diag ping gateway&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;netsh diag ping dns&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;netsh diag ping mail&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you're ever on a box and want to ping the gateway, don't bother looking it up with ipconfig and then typing it manually. Just pull out NETSH.EXE and rock on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>435</id><published>2004-06-20T02:32:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-06-20T02:32:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: shh! netsh</title><content type="html">dicussion of netsh and an alternative can be found here :)

It's been hitting closer to home: I've heard horror stories from students, and even some of my aquaintences have been hit. Stats I've seen indicate that one out of six people have been victimized. That's a shockingly large number.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;During my search, I surfed to Equifax and Transunion's websites and found that for only $40, I could get all three of my credit reports, instantly! What's up with that? I thought I was allowed to get a free copy of my credit report every year. Well, they sure don't advertise that option. They are also offering insurance against ID theft. For the low cost of 10 bucks per month, they will notify me when new stuff gets added to my credit report. How kind of them! Given that it's my information to begin with, and that I'd really rather they weren't keeping that data in the first place, this really seems to add insult to injury.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So I chatted with one of the other security MVPs who seemed to have some first hand knowledge of the issue. He agreed that the 10 bucks a month plan was ludicrous, and so I asked him just what *he* thinks one should do to protect one's identity. Here's the list he gave me:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1. Look at every CC and bank statement.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;2. Lock your mailbox and only put outgoing mail with checks and personal info in the post office internal mailboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;3. Fight tooth and nail everyone except your employer and institutions that pay you taxable income who asks for your SSN.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;4. Get the name of the individual who is requiring your SSN and let them know that you will be holding them personally responsible. They get more careful when they get nervous.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;5. Shred (get a cross-shredder) everything with your name and other information on it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;6. Teach your family secure behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;7. Pray, or sacrifice a goat as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We do (1) regularly, and (2) our mailbox is locked and we usually pay bills online. I've always been really picky about (3), although I've never done (4). We have an industrial strength shredder (5) that we use for any paper that even remotely identifies us or our friends. My wife has listened to me bitch enough about security that (6) is pretty much covered. I'm not a religious guy, so I guess I'll be buying a goat for (7) ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A bit of googling brought me to a really informative government site[1] that goes even further, suggesting novel ideas like giving out a password instead of your mother's maiden name, etc. A particularly good FAQ can be found there at [2].&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I've been fortunate that my family has never been attacked in this way, and if you're reading this, consider what actions you can take today to secure your family from this nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;One of the most compelling reasons (I thought) for getting people to do unit testing progressively as they write new code is that it's simply more efficient. I will spend much less time today writing a unit test for the code I'm working on today than I would at the end of the project when I need to go back and relearn that code in order to properly test it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The focus on boundary conditions also should help with documentation. Thinking â€o will I test this?â€bfore jumping in and hacking together a class or method naturally leads you to ask â€ut what the hell is this code supposed to do, anyway?â€Ad that tends to lead to better factored code: code that does one thing well, and that one thing is easier to document now that you have thought carefully about what you're trying to achieve, and the boundary conditions you're willing to accept (is it OK to pass an empty array or a null reference for parameter X, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Writing secure code is 90% about simply writing &lt;em&gt;robust&lt;/em&gt; code (well, throw in a heap of distrust for user input), and unit testing is a great tool for achieving these goals.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thanks to authors Hunt and Thomas for their good work, and thanks to the &lt;a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/cgi-local/pragprog?DenverPractitioners"&gt;Denver Pragmatic Practitioners&lt;/a&gt; for pointing it out to me in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;a href="http://www.iunknown.com"&gt;John Lam&lt;/a&gt; introduced me to Mark Miller, Chief Architect  of &lt;a href="http://www.devexpress.com"&gt;Developer Express&lt;/a&gt;, and he gave me a tour of their product, &lt;a href="http://www.devexpress.com/?section=/Products/NET/CodeRush"&gt;CodeRush&lt;/a&gt; (apparently the company used to be called &lt;a href="http://www.eagle-software.com/main.htm"&gt;Eagle Software&lt;/a&gt;, and this was a tool popular in the Delphi space). Anyway, CodeRush is now a Visual Studio .NET plugin that makes writing code a ton more fun, and really increases your productivity (I've been using EMACS lately but this might just switch me back). Their smart use of graphic elements like things so simple as a little imploding circle that draws your attention to where the cursor is whenever they move it for you really brings the world of text and graphics together in a way I've never seen before. It's very impressive. Because I was a speaker, I got a free copy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here's the problem. The product doesn't run properly unless you're an &lt;a href="book/html/lifestyle.html"&gt;administrator&lt;/a&gt;. Bah! I've sent mail to Mark and hopefully he can get the problems resolved, because I'd love to give this product a try. Sadly I can't say how good this product is because it's pretty much unusable for me at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

Seems like everyone we talk to is very excited about our new venture, and I've even lined up some work for us already.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;My preconference session on writing secure code (Sunday) was a big hit according to the evals - thanks to all who attended (click &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/events/teched_2004/PRC007"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the demos).

Turns out the security lecture was the last talk of the day, and I got there just in time to tag-team it with Ted. Damn that was fun - brought back great memories of teaching Guerrilla Windows with Ted and Mike and Fritz, years ago for DevelopMentor. I even got to heckle him ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent a lot of time talking about the difference between an impersonation/delegation model for authorization versus a trusted subsystem model. There are definitely pros and cons of each, and if you're interested in learning more about the issues, check out the &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/book/html/whatis_delegation.html"&gt;“What is delegation” item in my book&lt;/a&gt;. Somebody then asked about dealing with custom authentication front ends, where you end up storing Windows account names and passwords in the middle tier so you can connect to back end servers using Windows authentication, even though on the front end you're using something else (Kerb doesn't work well over the Internet due to typical firewall configurations). So that got me talking about &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/book/html/whatis_protocoltransition.html"&gt;protocol transition&lt;/a&gt;. I think the class really had fun - I so love talking about security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And heck, I even learned something about Sharepoint while I was there!

What a whirlwind trip we had - we talked to a bunch of different product groups, including the Indigo guys and the PAG team. Jim Newkirk was kind enough to give me a complimentary copy of his TDD book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone we met up there was really excited about Pluralsight, and were very supportive of our initiatives.

He was wondering why sometimes when he surfs to an internal website he is prompted for credentials, when the site is configured for integrated authentication. “Shouldn't it just happen automatically?” he asked. Apparently after he types in his Windows user name and password (the same account he's logged in with, by the way), things work great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever see one of those popups and you're surprised like Joe was, glance down at the status bar (you may have to turn the stupid thing on again if it's been turned off on you, but that's another post). Look and see what &lt;strong&gt;zone&lt;/strong&gt; that website is in. If it's the Internet zone, you're most likely just running into a security &lt;strong&gt;feature&lt;/strong&gt; that IE implements to help protect your anonymity when surfing the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring up the Internet Options dialog and flip to the Security tab. Select the Internet zone, then press “Custom Level...” to see the details of the protections IE provides you when surfing Internet sites. If you scroll down a bit, you'll probably see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/pluralsight_com/keith/25/r_auto_logon.PNG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why would a website inside of Joe's company be lumped in the “Internet” zone? Probably because Joe accessed it via a DNS name that had a dot in it (for example, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/"&gt;http://www.pluralsight.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;a href="http://192.168.0.22/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://192.168.0.22&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as opposed to &lt;a href="http://webbox/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://webbox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This is one heuristic that IE uses to figure out what's probably &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; in the “Local Intranet” zone. Anything that cannot be categorized in any other zone is automatically dropped into the Internet zone for safety sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have an internal website that use a lot and want to avoid being prompted for credentials, simply tell IE that this site should be considered part of the Local Intranet zone. You can do this by going to back to the Security tab and selecting the Local Intranet zone then pressing the “Sites...” button. If you look at the security settings for the Local Intranet zone, you'll see that it will automatically log you in without a prompt (of course if the website is using Basic authentication, this isn't possible because the website needs your cleartext password and you'll still be prompted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For external websites that you trust, you can also add them to the “Trusted Sites” zone in the same fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>8640</id><published>2005-05-27T07:40:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-05-27T07:40:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Internet Explorer and authentication</title><content type="html">So, given what you have said, which will be more secure to internal networks, intranet or trusted sites if you use a wild card setting?

They differ in different dimensions. Trusted Sites allows download of signed ActiveX controls without prompting, while Intranet requires a prompt by default.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But .NET Code Access Security policy grants downloaded apps in the Intranet zone more freedom (medium trust) than apps in Trusted Sites (low trust). Go figure.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;You can adjust all this stuff to suit your needs though. Just tweak the zone security settings by selecting "Custom Level".

You see, your logon session does not cache your full password when you log in to Windows - it hashes it and keeps that hash as a secret that can be used to do integrated authn.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But Basic requires the cleartext password. Your browser asks you for this, then remembers the password as long as you keep the browser open.

&lt;br /&gt;Couple things are off.
&lt;br /&gt;The book cover link didn't work.

The approach recommended by the &lt;a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-username-token-profile-1.0.pdf"&gt;UserNameToken profile&lt;/a&gt;, namely the one-time hash that is designed to counter replay attacks,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Password_Digest = Base64 ( SHA-1 ( nonce + created + password ) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;requires that the server store the client's cleartext password if simple passwords are being used - note that the profile also supports &lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;password&lt;/font&gt; being a one-time key or other secret such as that generated by a SecurID token. But the implementations and frameworks being built today (namely WSE) are taking this quite literally and using cleartext passwords for &lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;password&lt;/font&gt; by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main gripe with this simple implementation is that if an attack on the server leads to cleartext passwords being recovered, this is catastrophic! Passwords are generally used when humans are involved, and humans generally use the same password wherever they go. It's not a good practice, but it's one that the vast majority of people use today. No security-concious developer wants to be storing secrets on his machine. Especially secrets that in real life will often have a scope beyond her own application!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that &lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;password&lt;/font&gt; in the above function need not be a real cleartext password according to the profile, I see no reason why we cannot simply identify a scope over which a given password will be valid and identify a unique string or URI for that scope (this could be done through policy, perhaps). Then, we can start with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Password_Digest = Base64 ( SHA-1 ( nonce + created + validator ) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and we can then calculate &lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;validator&lt;/font&gt; as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;validator = Base64 ( SHA-1 ( scopeURI + cleartextPassword ) )&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which means the server would only need to store &lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;validator&lt;/font&gt;, as opposed to the cleartext password itself. If an attack on the server leads to these validators being compromised, the user's cleartext password is still safe. It's a simple idea, and I'd love for someone to explain why this isn't in the profile or implemented in WSE. Perhaps &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/aaron" title="Aaron Skonnard, MSDN columnist: XML Files"&gt;Aaron&lt;/a&gt; could comment on whether this notion of a &lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;scopeURI&lt;/font&gt; would be feasible - I'm sure he knows much more about policy than I do.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>12</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1536</id><published>2004-07-03T13:00:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-03T13:00:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Testing 123</title><content type="html">Testing .TEXT trackback feature</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1532"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1550</id><published>2004-07-05T10:42:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-05T10:42:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Avoiding Cleartext Passwords</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1532"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1555</id><published>2004-07-06T05:54:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-06T05:54:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">WS-Security UserNameToken and cleartext passwords</title><content type="html">Keith Brown makes some interesting points in his blog about WS-Security UserNameToken profile and storing cleartext passwords on the server.

I am thinking scopeURI effectively becomes a salt, so scopeURI could be anything known at both sides.  So may as well do:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Password_Digest = Base64 ( sha1( nonce + created + v )
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;v = Base64(sha1(password + salt))
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;salt = Base64(sha1(userName))
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;That way you don't have a lot of debug issues with what URI should I use, etc.  As a bonus, we can do this today.  And this would work with both SendPlainText and SendHashed.

And you'd like to have IIS use the client's credentials to talk to SQL Server, so you turn on impersonation in the web server and connect to the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a rather tricky thing that you need to know in order to make this work. Unless your SQL Server is running as SYSTEM (ugh) or Network Service, you will need to do BOTH of the following things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) Ensure that you use a DOMAIN account to run SQL Server (not a local account or Local Service).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) Ensure that this domain account has an appropriate SPN assigned to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course you really need to be using domain accounts throughout the entire system (your IIS AppPool needs to be running with domain credentials as well; this includes Network Service and, ugh, SYSTEM). Your clients will need to be using domain accounts as well, and you'll need to turn on delegation for the account your IIS AppPool is using. But that is all covered pretty thouroughly in other places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's not covered so well is the form of the SPN. After doing some network tracing today, I noticed that the SQL client libraries go to the domain controller looking for a ticket with an SPN that takes the following form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;MSSQLSvc/foo.bar.com:1433&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...assuming a connection string of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;integrated security=sspi;server=foo.bar.com; ...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So apparently the SPN MUST include the port number, even though this is the default port for SQL Server! Say you were running SQL Server under a domain account of BAR\Bob. You'd need to run the following command to add an SPN to the Bob account so that Active Directory will issue tickets for Bob when asked for a ticket for MSSQLSvc/foo.bar.com:1433&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;setspn -A MSSQLSvc/foo.bar.com:1433 bar\bob&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also wouldn't hurt to also register an SPN without the port, in case you're using an earlier client stack that relies on the default port syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;setspn -A MSSQLSvc/foo.bar.com bar\bob&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should always use the full DNS name of the server in your connection string (don't assume that your client library will convert a netbios server name in your connection string to a DNS name for the SPN - my stack seems to be doing this at the moment, but nothing says yours will!), so prefer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;server=foo.bar.com&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;server=foo&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in your mid-tier connection strings if you want delegation to work properly. It's possible to get it to work with netbios names in SPNs, but netbios names aren't necessarily unique throughout the domain, and if you accidentally end up with a duplicate SPN, guess what? Yea, authentication fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegation can be tricky, but this particular gotcha (the port number in the SPN) is pretty painful to debug, so I hope this saves somebody some headaches. If you want to know what this whole “SPN” business really means, read the following items in my &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/book"&gt;book online&lt;/a&gt;, in the following order:&lt;/p&gt;

But there's so much misinformation out there to confuse people. Take the SQL Server Books Online (which one would reasonably expect to be correct):
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;To create an SPN for SQL Server, enter the following code at a command prompt:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;setspn -A MSSQLSvc/Host:port serviceaccount
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;For example:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;setspn -A MSSQLSvc/server1.redmond.microsoft.com sqlaccount
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Where's the port in the example? I remember reading this and thinking that the default port syntax was ok. Too bad the books online doesn't have a link for feedback; I'd certainly tell the guy in charge of that page to fix it otherwise.

Yes, you'll get much less use from pooled connections using this technique than if you simply used a fixed identity to communicate with SQL Server, because the credentials used to establish two connections must be the same for them to be considered interchangeable (poolable). But consider the tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a fixed identity to talk to SQL Server, &lt;strong&gt;you've created a “trusted subsystem” model&lt;/strong&gt;. There's nothing inherently wrong with this, but you've shifted the burden of authorization from SQL Server to some middle tier component (perhaps a web server or application server, depending on how complex your system is). SQL Server now always sees the same user making all requests, and the middle tier (say the web server) holds these credentials 24/7. So what happens if the web server is compromised? That's right, the database is immediately compromised. The attacker simply uses a connection from the web server's pool, and because that connection has to be powerful enough to accomplish any task that any user coming through the web server could accomplish, the attacker immediately has broad reach into the database. Sure, he may not be able to drop tables, and in the best cases maybe he might not even be able to modify data (if the web interface to the data is read only, you should be connecting with a fixed identity that is granted read only access to the database; it's &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/book/html/whatis_polp.html"&gt;the principal of least privilege&lt;/a&gt;). But he will be able to read any data that any user could read, for certain, and that may include lots of personally identifiable information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, using delegation to talk to SQL Server, the web server doesn't need to have a login to SQL Server at all. The web server must wait until a user comes along, impersonate that user, and use her credentials to access the database. And how much of the data can that one user see? Hopefully only a very small slice; her own personal information, perhaps. In this scenario, &lt;strong&gt;the database does not trust the web server&lt;/strong&gt; and instead performs its own authorization. An attacker will need to wait until clients come along and hijack their connections to access the database. Over time, the attacker will gain more and more access to the database, but the key here is that this happens &lt;strong&gt;over time&lt;/strong&gt;. If you've built any sort of &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/book/html/whatis_acountermeasure.html"&gt;detection and reaction countermeasures&lt;/a&gt; into your system, this gives them time to kick in and discover that an attack is in progress, and take appropriate action to halt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So sure, you can use a fixed identity to get connection pooling. But consider whether the tradeoff is worth it &lt;em&gt;for the system you are building&lt;/em&gt;. Does that system really need the scalability that connection pooling is touted to provide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings me to another point. What is this dogma that we all seem to believe that without connection pooling our applications will shrivel up and die? Theoretically, connection pooling was more useful in Windows NT 4 than it is in Windows 2000. Why? Because a connection implies authentication, and domain authentication on NT 4 was rather expensive for the server. During every connection the client made to the server, the server was required to “pass through” authentication back to the client's domain controller. If the client and server were in different domains, this meant the database was forced to wait for &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; domain controllers to respond. But Windows 2000 with Active Directory and Kerberos changed all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Kerb, it's &lt;em&gt;the client&lt;/em&gt; who contacts the domain controllers, not the server. And she caches the result of that communication for the entire workday (assuming she doesn't log out). Now in a multi-tier system, technically the web server is acting on the client's behalf, and so the web server will need to contact the domain controller to obtain a ticket for the client (and that ticket won't be cached because the client's logon session on the web server is only temporary), but that still removes a lot of the burden from the database. It's easy to add another web server if load increases; not so easy to add another data server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course if the connection protocol between the client and server is chatty, then connection pooling is still going to buy you something. But I'd argue that if it's chatty, Microsoft should focus on making it less so. It's certainly not security that's making it chatty - Kerb authentication can be done in a single round trip as far as the database is concerned, and this roundtrip can be piggybacked on top of the normal application-level protocol that has to happen anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in a situation where your load is so great that you must use connection pooling, so be it. But if you can afford to delegate client credentials through, you'll have a less brittle system from a security standpoint (note that this might *cost* more as well, due the licensing model of SQL Server, but security isn't usually free).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am saying is don't simply assume your application &lt;em&gt;must have&lt;/em&gt; connection pooling. Prove it. You can get better security by avoiding the use of a fixed identity. For another idea on building a hybrid of the two systems, check out my &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/book/html/whatis_delegation.html"&gt;discussion of delegation&lt;/a&gt; in the book.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>9</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1593</id><published>2004-07-09T09:54:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-09T09:54:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Connection Pooling: Dogma or Holy Grail?</title><content type="html">I totally agree - connection pooling is a perf optimization, and as such shouldn't be done prematurely.

My opinion is that it should be used anytime you would have stored user names and passwords on a gateway box and called LogonUser to establish a logon for use with back end services. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;With protocol transition, you can avoid storing passwords on the web server and get better constraint on the use of credentials (you can say exactly what back end services the middle tier gateway is allowed to talk to using transitioned credentials). I personally think it's a great feature, but of course it only works if you're in a W2K3 domain and the gateway is also running W2K3, so for some folks it's only a far off dream :-(

&lt;br /&gt;I would love to be able to show them convincing evidence that performance does not *have* to suck, but if all I have to offer is "you need better security, so you better prove the site *needs* pooling", the conversation usually ends there.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Any further guidance on scenarios in which you've found pooling to not make much difference, authentication protocols that are slower or faster, or levels of throughput that make pooling necessary?

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I feel I should make a comment since some contributors seems to be taking these suggestions as gospel and pushing this approach to development staff.  I believe Keith is demonstrating what can be achieved, but several of the approaches require much more management and have a significant overhead than if standard best practise was followed.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This review is not meant as a criticism of the articles but I strongly encourage the reader to apply them sensibly to the real world scenarios they face.  Security and risk management in general should be taken as a whole and the potential exploit mentioned as justification for this approach is not something that would seriously be considered in such an application.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you plan to do so in a small environment or a test lab then fine, but don't expect such a system to scale well or even work reliably in a large enterprise!

&lt;br /&gt;I will stick to what is proven to scale; it has to scale (and I don't reject security requirements, I understand they are serious) but not what isn't proven - at least until there's proof. ;-)

&lt;p&gt;I am so incredibly sick of this bug in VPC that causes my keyboard to stop working in ALL virtual machines that are open. I have to shut down all virtual machines (and also remember to open up the VPC manager window and shut down VPC itself) and restart the whole shebang to get my damn keyboard back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen lots of people say this only happens when they use ALT-ENTER to switch to full screen, and then it's just a hung metakey that can be unstuck by whacking the metakeys once a piece. Well for me, this just happens randomly - I'm not using ALT-ENTER at all, and I can't unstick the keys (I don't think the CTRL key is stuck, because I'm not seeing the behavior you'd expect when you type with the CTRL key down - nothing happens at all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anybody has a REAL fix for this, please, please, let me know. This thing is almost unusable the way it is now. I'm running four VPCs (simulating a three tier system with a separate domain controller), and having to shut the whole thing down and resume it every 10 minutes is driving me absolutely crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody tell me why I shouldn't just spend some $$$ and start using VMware instead...&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks for your tip about key combinations !!!!. I found that the combination is Left ALT-SHIFT, where you must hold the SHIFT key for a while. It switches between double quote and tilde keys.

They currently have a solution that requires anonymous callbacks to Windows XP clients. The picture isn't looking very pretty at the moment. Here's what you have to do to enable anonymous callbacks to a base COM client process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Call CoInitializeSecurity in the usual way to turn off authentication requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Put the application on the SP2 Security Center “exception” list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Put port 135 on the same list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Add a grant for ANONYMOUS LOGON to the machine-wide DCOM access limit DACL, granting remote access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both (1) and (2) aren't too big of a deal, as they only impact a particular application (although if the application doesn't code expecting malicious input, it could be very bad indeed). But (3) and (4) cause the user to walk away with a much less secure computer overall. If we could be certain the client computers were in a domain, we'd have a bit less trouble, as there are two profiles for domain machines - one when it's on the domain network and one when it's on any other network, but that is probably not an option here. (3) can be solved by using a static port - the only reason port 135 is necessary is for OXID resolution, which only happens if you use dynamic ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out if you are communicating with RPC, you can programmatically allow anonymous calls into your process, because (4) doesn't apply to you. There is no machine-wide DACL for RPC servers. So by simply exposing an interface that uses a static endpoint (to avoid 3), and by registering your interface with a security callback (RpcServerRegisterIfEx with the RPC_IF_ALLOW_CALLBACKS_WITH_NO_AUTH flag), all you end up having to do to allow anonymous callbacks is to whitelist your executable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral of the story here is that if you have a system that relies on anonymous callbacks to clients who will be running Windows XP Service Pack 2, you've got some serious thinking to do.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>1658</id><published>2004-07-21T19:59:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-07-21T19:59:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">The DevelopMentor Crowd - Where Are They Now?</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://barracuda.net/BarrysBlog.aspx"&gt;http://barracuda.net/BarrysBlog.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

All 75 items have been doled out to various people. To those who sent me mail volunteering to help, thank you so much - this new format will be much more amenable to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to subscribe to the RSS feed for the book once it stabilizes (once the port is complete, which should take a week or two really to settle down). I plan on continuing to add items to the Wiki, leading towards a second edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there's anyone who still wants to help, feel free to take an item or two that's already done and just poke around looking for things that need fixing. For example, many function calls in the prose are PascalCased and show up as WikiWords. You can fix this by surrounding the word with @ symbols: @SomeFunctionCall@. This will make the word show up in a fixed font, and will remove the dashed underline, which really doesn't belong. For other words that shouldn't be made fixed font, just double-double quote them: ""ACL"" for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure captions should be italicized, so surround those lines with underscores like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forbes has an interesting discussion of hacking the Radio Frequency ID tags that will soon be used to identify and check out items at big grocery chains. I'm not sure why the RFID consultant they interviewed thought someone carrying an RFID reader would “l&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;&lt;span class="mainarttxt"&gt;ikely be detected” - this sort of theft will be real, I think.

&lt;br /&gt;This "register phreaking" ought to be easy for stores to work around, at least if they're networked to the store's main computer, as they could check the product's tag price to the master price, or ignore the tag price completely.

&lt;br /&gt;Hmmm... cheap bottle/cask/case of red wine, expensive bottle/cask/case of red wine - weight difference: negligible.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So I can't rip off the price of cheap items like toothpaste or toilet paper, but I can do the high end stuff which tends to be sold in standardised packaging. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Out of curiousity, what're the most expensive items in your local store - over Christmas my local supermarket sells some pretty expensive bottles of single malt in standard 750ml bottles... guess I should expect these to come in a fancy gift wrapped box with special tumbler included just to make it weigh more...

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I always assumed the reason for weighing items was to ensure that you were scanning each item. In the stores I've seen, there is an employee of the store watching four of those kiosks, making sure people are following the procedure (scan item, put in bag which is connected to the scale). The combination of the human and the register tracking the increasing weight as items are scanned reduces the chance for someone to avoid scanning an item. The scale and cashier serves as a detection countermeasure, while the cashier doubles as a reaction countermeasure.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1802"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>16928</id><published>2005-11-18T19:05:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-11-18T19:05:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: RFID Hacking</title><content type="html">No,  I have gone to Wal Mart and used the automated lines to purchase something very heavy.

I remember working with Windows NT 4 and it seemed like everything I asked to be audited actually &lt;strong&gt;got audited&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when Win2K shipped, I noticed that sometimes I'd establish a logon, I wouldn't get a successful logon audit. I don't remember the exact details, but it just seemed like auditing got less reliable in Win2K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'm working with W2K3, and I'm trying to import an IPSEC policy, and I'm told “A required privilege is not held by the client”, which basically means that the OS tried to enable a privilege that wasn't in my token. No problem, I figure. I'll just go turn on auditing of privilege use and audit failures in order to figure out exactly which privilege I'm missing. Of course after I did this and retried the import, I got the same error, and no audit was generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anybody on the security team at MS is reading this, guys, it'd be really helpful if auditing could be made more robust...&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1857</id><published>2004-08-12T09:14:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-08-12T09:14:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Holes in Windows auditing</title><content type="html">I'm not alone! :-)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally, I find the local policy(ies) on the machine are restricting the audit trail for certain events/objects (i.e. Audit logon events). Rarely, the problem can be attributed to something a little deeper, such as a full event log that is not configured to overwrite events on an as-needed basis.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;1. Log set to "retain X days".  In this case, if the log is full and no events are older than X days, new events are discarded until the oldest event is at least X days old and can be overwritten.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;2. Missing logoff events due to token leak.  Under the hood, a logon event is created when a logon session is created (== call to logonuser or acceptsecuritycontext, roughly == token creation).  A logoff event is created when a logon session is destroyed, which happens when the token reference count drops to 0 (no processes are using the token anymore)).  There is a common class of bug, sometimes committed by MSFT developers, often by third parties, where a token is duplicated or otherwise referenced, but never properly dereferenced.  It is almost the same type of coding error as a memory leak.  A token leak causes the refcount to never decrease to 0, which causes the logon session never to be destroyed, which causes no logoff event to be generated.  Look at the field "caller process ID" in 528/540 on Windows Server 2003 when there's no 538 matching the logon ID: that is probably your culprit.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately there's no easy fix to the token leak problem, but we're looking at alternatives.  As a workaround we added a "begin logoff" event for Windows Server 2003, which can be used in place of the logoff event 538 when a token leak is present.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As far as priv use audits go, certain privileges are WAY too noisy and are never audited: SeDebugPrivilege, SeChangeNotifyPrivilege, etc.  Look up "FullPrivilegeAuditing" in the Knowledge Base- it's a reg key that can override the default suppression.

They are all 538/540 logon/logoff events with a couple of 576 privelege use events thrown in for extra flavor.  Also, all are using the SYSTEM account to generate the event.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Or rather, using my normal tools, I came to the conclusion that every single one was a fraud, for several reasons. First, they're all hosted on mailfrontier.com despite purporting to be from somewhere else. Second, all of the links have been nobbled (by mailfrontier.com) and don't link where they purport to link to - they all open a popup instead. So clearly these are *all* fakes...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Of course both of those things were done so they could put the tests up on their web sites.  But this means that my usual mode of self defense - viewing the source, checking headers, checking the origin of the data, checking the true target of the links - has been removed from me.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'm curious to know what techniques other people have been using to try and work out whether they are real or not. The changes made to frame these as a test pinned my bogometer on every single one, but evidently the rest of you are all using different techniques to test from me.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Actually, what's particularly interesting is that if I make the assumption that the link target it tries to show me in the status bar is where it would have taken me, I can get full marks on the test.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But that's an extremely dangerous assumption - indeed, these samples *all* prove that you should *never* trust what your status bar tells you. (In fact I'm running Firebird, and it didn't display anything in the status bar when hovering.)</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1883"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1906</id><published>2004-08-17T06:10:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-08-17T06:10:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Your Phishing IQ</title><content type="html">Rjae: It's a good idea - building in tools that help average users perform the same sorts of analysis that geeks do every day...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Ian: I normally surf with FireFox, but the site seemed to run best using IE, so I used IE for the test. I hovered over the links and was able to see where they *would* have pointed to in the status bar, and did a view|source to look at the full link when I wasn't sure. I still missed one - the earthlink one used an interesting technique I'd not seen before. I think for the average user, who wouldn't know how to View|Source anyway, this would be a bit more interesting.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;FWIW, so far I've gotten back five responses from my "non-technical" friends. The average score is 76. At least one of them admitted that since this was a test, he paid closer attention than he would normally.
&lt;br /&gt;

In the situation where he did "View Source", I had already seen suspicious behavior in IE and I only did "View Source" to see how it was done.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Here's the one I got wrong, and I think this was a low trick.  The legitimate e-mail from Microsoft had a URL hosted on g.msn.com and the URL looked like it could be hosting anyone.  I received dozens of spam e-mails containing URLs starting with g.msn.com.  I have never received a legitimate e-mail containing a URL starting with g.msn.com.  I reported to Microsoft dozens of spam sites being served by redirection from g.msn.com.  Microsoft used to answer that g.msn.com wasn't an MSN account so Microsoft was not going to take any action.  After a while Microsoft stopped answering.  Microsoft NEVER said that they would take any action to discontinue the redirection service that they were providing to spamming partners.  So naturally I was suspicious of any site hosted at g.msn.com.  It looked to me like any phishing spammer could hold that URL.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;For the PayPal e-mails I did "View Source" after not seeing anything suspicious in IE.  For the remaining cases it was not necessary to do "View Source" because things were already obvious.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1883"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>45582</id><published>2007-01-04T19:04:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-04T19:04:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Your Phishing IQ</title><content type="html">My mozilla firefox is going thru login.live.com and also g.msn and c.msn.

The CPU obviously must do its job correctly: a mistake during an access check would open a security hole. The hardware that implements virtual memory must not be corrupt or one process might be able to read or write another process's memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your video card had better not lie to you, and you normally expect your printer to print the exact contents of the document you just received in the mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your keyboard had better not lie or record what you're typing. Oh and while we're at it, the drivers behind all these devices are not usually subject to any security policy since they usually run in privileged mode (ring 0 on WIntel systems).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a lot of stuff to trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just thinking about that should make you suspicious of hardware and driver vendors and anyone who gets remotely close (physically) to your hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How real is the threat? Check out &lt;a href="http://www.keykatch.com/"&gt;http://www.keykatch.com/&lt;/a&gt; to see how easy it is for someone to compromise your keyboard. For many years I've kept one of these little doodads in my backpack to demo to my students. Most are blown away that such a thing exists. It's an eye opener - I just make sure it's not in my bag when I travel to foriegn countries or the NSA. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You all probably know how dangerous it is to use hardware you don't trust.

&lt;br /&gt;Intel has published a lot of errata.  Intel has also kept secret a lot of errata.  It is not rare for BIOSes to load microcode to fix CPU bugs at boot time.

&lt;br /&gt;You'd be amazed.  But of course most of the problems are BSODs from drivers (which are usually Microsoft-provided drivers) rather than security problems.

This is usually because of the way I use my dual monitors and switch one between machines. Regardless, this technique will come in handy if you've not used it before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Activate the window. This may take some guesswork if the window doesn't show up on your taskbar. Either click it on your task bar, or &lt;strong&gt;ALT-TAB&lt;/strong&gt; until you think you've activated the one you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Press &lt;strong&gt;ALT+SPACE&lt;/strong&gt; followed by &lt;strong&gt;m&lt;/strong&gt; (for “Move“). This will move the mouse to the center of the title bar of the window. You could use the keyboard to move the window if you wanted to, but we'll use the mouse instead. If you can see the window on your taskbar, you can right-click and select “Move“ instead if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Carefully, without moving the mouse, click down to grab the window and drag it back to your desktop. As long as the window isn't ridiculously far away (i.e., the application is buggy and has placed your window millions of pixels away from where your desktop is, you'll be all set. For me, I usually know right where my lost windows are (over to the left where my second monitor would normally display them), so I just drag over to the right and I'm set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If (3) isn't working for you, the window may be maximized. Press &lt;strong&gt;ALT+SPACE&lt;/strong&gt; followed by &lt;strong&gt;r&lt;/strong&gt; (for “Restore“). This will restore the window if it's maximized somewhere (another monitor perhaps). Then go to (2) and try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps somebody.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>49</thr:total></entry><entry><id>1943</id><published>2004-08-18T11:57:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-08-18T11:57:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Recovering lost windows</title><content type="html">You can also use the arrow keys once you've done alt-space m to move the window.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="1940"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>1944</id><published>2004-08-18T14:42:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-08-18T14:42:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Recovering lost windows</title><content type="html">This annoys the hell out of me and happens all the time.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If the window's button in the task bar has also been lost, then another way to bring back the application is to open Windows Task Manager to its Applications tab, select the application, and click the Switch To button.  In my experience this usually restores a minimized application and then shortly afterwards restores its task bar button.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Of course if the window is off the screen then you'll still have to proceed to the other tricks to bring it on screen.

&lt;br /&gt;You can also use the arrow keys *before* clicking the window, press ALT+SPACE, m, then use any of the arrow keys. Once you have done this, the mouse is locked to the window and will drag the window until you click the mouse. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

It's interesting to see this - &lt;a href="http://www.counterpane.com"&gt;Fergusen and Schneier&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="http://www.schneier.com/book-practical.html"&gt;Practical Cryptography&lt;/a&gt;, warn that hash functions have not received much cryptanalysis, and recommend choosing a strong hash from the SHA family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that reason, I've been pointing my students and clients toward SHA-256.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this will show the wisdom of their suggestions. FWIW, cryptographers have known for a long time that MD5 was weaker than SHA-1, and the attacks described in the article above seem to strengthen that argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more info, see &lt;a href="http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham/publications.html"&gt;Eli Biham's publication page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing Secure Code 2cnd Ed.(Howard &amp;amp; LeBlanc) - great book for learning how to avoid bugs like SQL injection, cross site scripting, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secrets and Lies (Bruce Schneier) - the ins and outs of security; there's no code here, but this is a very enjoyable book, and I think it's a must read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploiting Software (Hogland, McGraw) - excellent (a bit more advanced) book on hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, you should check out my book, but I already gave you links for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I use Virtual PC all the time to model security systems. About a year ago, I built a pretty beefy machine that I dedicated to hosting VPCs: it's got 2G of RAM and about 250G of HD space arranged in RAID 0 for performance. I normally launch the VPCs I want and then use terminal server to connect to them from my laptop, which is the center of my world. I can then roam around the house using wireless, and I have a whole host of machines that I can use for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well today I am running three machines: a W2K3 domain controller, a W2K3 SQL Server box, and an XP dev box with VS.NET 2005. The XP box needs plenty of memory to run VS.NET so that it's usable, but the DC and the SQL box need very little memory. In fact, I've managed to allocate the minimum of 128M of RAM to those two VPCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's nice about allocating the minimum possible RAM to a VPC is that it starts and saves very quickly. Compared to my dev image, the DC and SQL images start up almost instantaneously, and save just as fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's my VPC tip of the day: think carefully about how much RAM you need in each VPC. Try to find the minimum amount that works for you, especially for servers. You'll be happy you did!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>2206</id><published>2004-09-08T10:39:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-09-08T10:39:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: VPC tip</title><content type="html">you are about 62 OS's behind this guy</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2194"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>2233</id><published>2004-09-13T08:29:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-09-13T08:29:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Geek Notes 2004-09-13</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2194"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>2306</id><published>2004-09-16T13:06:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-09-16T13:06:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">ACLing removable media</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;A fellow sent me mail the other day asking how to restrict access to removable drives. There's no UI option for this (the property page for a CD-ROM drive doesn't have a Security tab), but apparently it is possible to &lt;/font&gt;&lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;150101"&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;ACL access to these volumes programmatically by calling SetSecurityInfo&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;Whidbey will make this much easier, given that security descriptors and ACLs are first class citizens now (yea!) but what it won't do is give you a nice little UI for setting up the ACL. One thing I'd really like to see wrapped in the .NET Framework is the ISecurityInformation interface. It'd be great to be able to easily incorporate a security property page into a GUI. If we had that, building a tool for ACLing volumes would be trivial.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;So I am going to see how hard it is to implement ISecurityInformation purely in C#. This should be a considerable challenge given how the interface works (whoever designed it knew nothing about COM, I fear). I need to write another column for MSDN Magazine anyway, so if I'm successful, I'll write about it there.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;In the meantime, if anyone knows of a managed implementation or wrapper for ISecurityInformation that already exists, let me know, would ya?

I've done that many times. The challenge is bridging the gap to the managed world. Heck, I'm soooo done with C++. But you're right, I may end up using MC++ for the wrapper. From what I've read, you need to use MC++ to implement a custom marshaler anyway. But it'll be an interesting challenge - I've never tried hooking into the custom marshaling architecture before. I don't think there will be *more* marshaling in the C# case - it'll just use a different architecture.

At least in 1.1, you can't get at them via reflection, and PERMVIEW does a really lousy job of formatting its output. Honestly, why write a tool that spits out part XML and part text?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;permview /decl mscorlib.dll&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assembly RequestMinimum permission set:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;PermissionSet class="System.Security.PermissionSet"&lt;br /&gt;               version="1"&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;   &amp;lt;IPermission class="System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermission, mscorlib,&lt;br /&gt; Version=1.0.5000.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089"&lt;br /&gt;                version="1"&lt;br /&gt;                Flags="SkipVerification"/&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I wrote a little filter that you can pipe this output through. It parses and builds well-formed XML, turning the goo above into something infinitely more usable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;PermissionDeclarations&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;AssemblyPermissionRequest requestType='RequestMinimum'&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;PermissionSet class="System.Security.PermissionSet"               version="1"&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;IPermission class="System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermission, mscorlib,&lt;br /&gt;Version=1.0.5000.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089"&lt;br /&gt;     version="1"                Flags="SkipVerification"/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/PermissionSet&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/AssemblyPermissionRequest&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can optionally specify -noroot if you are going to use this in a shell script that enumerates a bunch of assemblies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;permview /decl %1.dll | formatpermviewdecl -noroot &amp;gt;&amp;gt; output.xml&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've now got a single XML file that has all security declarations for the entire .NET Framework 1.1. Using an XPath query tool like &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/05/25/1420.aspx"&gt;Craig's xpq&lt;/a&gt;, I can do searches (e.g., which methods/classes/assemblies require full trust?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I figured others might find a use for this thing, so I uploaded it to our &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/tools.aspx"&gt;tools page&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;My order is in (thanks for the bookpool pointer).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I do have one question:  why is .NET stressed in the title when it really seems to be about Win32 security?  Unless I'm missing something, there doesn't seem to be any discussion about CAS, which I would think to be the most important (and new to the Win32 programmer) aspect of .NET Framework security.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to any and all articles, books, or whatever you might be planning on Framework oriented security.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless Mike B's question surely deserves an answer.  Why is .NET stressed in the title?  For readers who are still new to .NET, we can read tons of stuff in either your wiki or your book and not be aware of what we're missing.  If Visual Studio 2005 becomes sufficiently reliable then .NET will become very attractive to VC++ programmers.  Surely both Win32 and .NET security are important.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2346"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>2428</id><published>2004-09-25T06:36:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-09-25T06:36:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: The book ships</title><content type="html">Unlike years ago when I wrote my first security book, there are a whole bunch of books on security for .NET developers right now. Most of them focus on all the new stuff in the .NET Framework, and the few that say much about operating system security (what I term "Windows Security") often get it subtly or blatantly wrong.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;There are even errors in the LaMacchia book in this regard. My goal was to provide a concise guide for .NET developers to operating system security features such as impersonation, logon sessions, etc.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And there is a weakness in the 1.1 framework class library: it does not wrap much at all of the functionality of windows security, so in many places I show how a .NET developer can access those features, and I talk about how things get better in v2.0.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So it's a guide to Windows security for .NET developers. Thus the title.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2346"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>2472</id><published>2004-09-29T10:58:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-09-29T10:58:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: The book ships</title><content type="html">The download link for the Code Samples is broken due to a trailing period inside the HREF.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2346"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>2476</id><published>2004-09-29T11:24:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-09-29T11:24:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: The book ships</title><content type="html">Ahh thanks.

Turns out the cleanest way was to write a custom CCW in MC++. For those of you who are wondering what the heck I'm talking about, this allows you to add that nifty ACL editor GUI to your managed applications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/images/blogged/acluiadapter2.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...along with all its accoutrements...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/images/blogged/acluiadapter1.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sample application that comes with the adapter uses it to edit service ACLs (something the Windows administration tools don't provide except via group policy):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/images/blogged/acluiadapter3.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use this adapter, write a class that implements ISecurityInformationManaged and pass an instance to AclUIAdapter.EditSecurity(). All this stuff is in a namespace called Pluralsight.Security.Adapters. &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/security/code/acluiadapter.zip"&gt;You can download the code and sample application here&lt;/a&gt;.

I say this because they all have the 0x00020000 bit set. My understanding was that each of the specific permissions is supposed to be mapped to exactly 1 of the general permissions.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Second, i am trying to figure out how to properly propagate permissions to private child objects. I'm using the AclUIAdapter but not the ServiceHelper (can't get it to build using VS2005 with .NET version 2.0.50727). In any case, when SetSecurity() is invoked due to modifications in from GUI, i need to determine what change was made, and if it involves inheritable permissions. Do i have to examine each ACE separately, or is there some general way to determine if the modifications involve inheritable properties.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I don't wannt to just automatically traverse the entire subtree below the object that the changes were made to, particularly because that will optentially involve over 10 million private objects (stored in a database) under certain circumstances.

That would be a very good optimization to make in your case though! AS for generic permissions, they will almost always map onto more than one standard/specific permission.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As for my previous permission comment, i think that you read it backwards. I agree that each generic permission is made up of multiple specific permissions and thats fine. But, each specific permission should only be a part of one generic permission, but all of your SERVICE_* permissions use the 0x00020000 bit. Separated into their bits, the service permissions are:
&lt;br /&gt;SERVICE_READ = 0x00020000 | 0x00000080 | 0x00000008 | 0x00000004 | 0x00000001;
&lt;br /&gt;SERVICE_WRITE = 0x00020000 | 0x00000002;
&lt;br /&gt;SERVICE_EXECUTE = 0x00020000 | 0x00000100 | 0x00000040 | 0x00000020 | 0x00000010;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Also, i'd think that this should always be true:
&lt;br /&gt;SERVICE_ALL = SERVICE_READ | SERVICE_WRITE | SERVICE_EXECUTE;
&lt;br /&gt;(its not)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;and that this should also be true:
&lt;br /&gt;SERVICE_READ &amp;amp; SERVICE_WRITE &amp;amp; SERVICE_EXECUTE = 0x00000000
&lt;br /&gt;(its not)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your time.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Where did you read that a standard or specific permission can only be in one of the generic permissions? I don't know of any such limitation.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you look in winnt.h you'll find why I use 0x20000 in each of the generic permission mappings. This is the standard READ_CONTROL permission, which appears to be intended for all three generic permissions:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;#define STANDARD_RIGHTS_READ             (READ_CONTROL)
&lt;br /&gt;#define STANDARD_RIGHTS_WRITE            (READ_CONTROL)
&lt;br /&gt;#define STANDARD_RIGHTS_EXECUTE          (READ_CONTROL)

I hadn't read anywhere regarding the disjoint nature of the general permissions, it was more of an initial feeling about them. I'm new to ACL progarmming and wanted to make certain whether or not my intuition was correct. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I've got my app almost working, filling in the details for some of the lesser used features of the adapter...still need to deal with the sledgehammer :)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, one (hopefully) last question. In the definition of the SecurityInformation enum in Pluralsight.Security.Adapters there are 8 flags defined, but i sometimes get additional ones back from the adapter in the SetSecurity() method. For instance, when the propagate owner to subcontainers box is checked, i get back 257 for the SecurityInformation. Black box testing has convinced me that 256 is the flag for recursing the owner (1 is the existence of owner info in the modifications).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Just wondering if i can find a complete definition of those flags so that i don't have to figure them all out by trial and error.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;I have yet another question for you. I've gotten most of what i need to work properly in terms of propagating security modifications properly, etc. The thing that i still can't get to work properly is how to apply inherit only aces. When i get a modification descriptor back from the AclUiAdapter, i traverse the aces to determine what to do with them, apply, inherit, etc. But when i attempt to apply an inherit only ace to the object / container that is the root for that inherit only ace (doesn't apply to it, but will apply to the appropraite children), i can't get it to apply properly. I can see that it has the PropgateFlag 'Inherit Only', but when i attempt to add it to the existing ACL it applies as an effective ace. I assumed that the propagation flag would be applied.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I am using SetPrivateObjectSecurityEx() to merge the existing ACL with the new modified information.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Is this the wrong approach, or do i need to do some explicit bit flipping to get the new information as i need it?
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;I've adapted your program to edit the ACL of a network share. It appears to be working, but I had to make some guesses on the mask values for the various access levels. I couldn't find them in any Win32 header.
&lt;br /&gt;Would you like to include this code with your app?

&lt;p&gt;If you are relying on &amp;lt;authorization&amp;gt; sections in subdirectories (or via &amp;lt;location&amp;gt; in your web.config files), you should be aware of a canonicalization bug in ASP.NET that can allow an attacker to slip past the UrlAuthorizationModule by using a backslash instead of a forward slash. For example, an (unauthorized) attacker might be able to get to a secured directory as follows (note the backslash between “bar“ and “secure“ in the sample URL below):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://quux.com/foo/bar\secure/securedPage.aspx"&gt;http://quux.com/foo/bar\secure/securedPage.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/incident/aspnet.mspx"&gt;posted an article&lt;/a&gt; detailing steps that you can take to protect yourself in the meantime, while they work on a patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked with &lt;a href="http://www.leastprivilege.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=160fb9e2-b078-4f9f-bbf2-24beda63f049"&gt;dominick&lt;/a&gt; on this one to see if we could reproduce it.

The workarounds by MS are just 'prevention' or 'protection', it's far from FIXing the 'hole'. Hence with urlscan or IIS6 (without urlscan), I strongly urged you guys to apply the MSI package. and hope MS come out a real fix soon, as you never know other types of 'malform' url request may actually skip through those checking ... I don't know what type of malform requests it will be, but the bad guys will figure out soon :)  for IIS 6 test result, you can view it at my blog.

&lt;p&gt;1) You can't install this program unless you're an administrator. This isn't surprising, and isn't really all that big of a deal, until you consider,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/images/blogged/google_desktop_search_2.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) This program won't launch unless you're running under the same account you installed it under. LAME!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a sad day when the folks at Google blow it this bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: &lt;a href="http://desktop.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=10722&amp;amp;topic=96"&gt;here's their solution&lt;/a&gt;. Add yourself to admin group, install, remove yourself. Seems to be working so far. You know, if they'd just defer launching the application - let you launch it under the account you plan on using it under, I think it'd be fine.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;They have to require higher privilege to install, but they should defer indexing until the application is actually launched by a user.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that as soon as you install it, they assume that same user is the one who will be using the program.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Indexing definitely needs to be done on a per-user basis, because a lot of the things they are indexing are in the user profile, and are not accessible to other users.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So they are close - their install/startup procedure just needs a little work.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2810"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>2820</id><published>2004-10-15T07:46:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-10-15T07:46:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Google Desktop added to Hall of Shame</title><content type="html">I used the &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/aaron_margosis/archive/2004/07/24/193721.aspx"&gt;MakeMeAdmin.cmd shell&lt;/a&gt; from Aaron Margosis this morning to install Google Desktop on my laptop.

It doesn't (yet) give the same Firewall messages as WXPSP2 does, but it gives some other messages and other random failures.  For example the automatic version of Windows Update automatically downloads .NET Framework 1.1 SP1 but can't install it.  Windows Update does detect its own failure and then displays incorrect instructions in IE about how to supposedly retry the failed operation.  In fact Windows Update remains broken until IE is closed and reopened.  Fortunately Windows Update makes a partial recovery after closing and reopening IE, though this security update still fails.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Manually trying to download by following links from msdn.microsoft.com gives various IE error messages along the way and ends up at not being able to download the W2003 version of .NET Framework 1.1 SP1.  After making a security change to IE, W2003 can download the thing but then can't install it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;One reason for failure seems to be an attempt to dereference a null pointer during installation.  It's really comforting to see how .NET Framework 1.1 SP1 is supposed to improve security.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;W2003 also makes other problems for MSDN and Visual Studio.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="2811"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>2882</id><published>2004-10-18T21:10:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-10-18T21:10:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: WinXP SP2 added to Hall of Shame</title><content type="html">I hear you Keith, this was bugging me for ages.

Seeing as how this version of WinXP came installed on my OEM computer Im not about to spend $99.00 to pay to fix their POS.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So now the security update is hidden but I still get the obnoxious "security updates are available for your computer" sitting down in the tool bar. I hate MS.

The books out there now are either going out of print, or are generally focused on using VBScript or C++ to program with ADSI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know how many of you have used S.DS, but (besides it's lack of support for partial trust), it's a great way to interact with the directory system. A book on this topic, with samples in C# or VB.NET would really be timely, I think. Integrating with AD is a great leverage point for enterprise developers, and with S.DS, it's really gotten a lot more mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm talking with the editors at Addison Wesley to gauge their interest in such a title. Do any of you with a lot of experience programming AD have the cycles and interest to work on this? I'd be happy to help with the organization, overall story, and reviewing. I just don't have the cycles to be the author. Starting a new company takes a lot of attention :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a common scenario. Alice makes a call to Bob (Bob exposes some sort of interface, either a web app GUI or web service, it doesn't matter which). She uses a certificate to prove her identity. Bob validates Alice's certificate and looks it up in Active Directory and finds a user account via altSecurityIdentities. He then uses protocol transition to connect to Charlie, his SQL server, using Alice's credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;new WindowsIdentity(clientUPN).Impersonate();&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(”server=charlie;integrated security=sspi”);&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the gotcha. If Bob isn't running with high privilege, the SQL connection will fail before it even leaves Bob's machine! The SQL client-side plumbing uses performance counters, which open registry keys. But the the token Bob is impersonating is an IDENTIFY level token, because S4U2Self gives you an IDENTIFY token unless you're running in the TCB. And IDENTIFY tokens cannot be used to open secure objects (like registry keys), so the request fails before it even leaves the box!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One “solution” is to make Bob's application run as SYSTEM. This will work because S4U2Self will issue an IMPERSONATE token. But this is a horrible idea, for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another solution is to factor out the code &lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;new WindowsIdentity(clientUPN) &lt;/font&gt;into a separate process (like a COM+ server) that runs as SYSTEM. I've done this and it works fine. But how many people know how to do this sort of thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point here is that protocol transition will encourage people to run middle-tier apps with high privilege when they shouldn't have to. What's the solution? Perhaps the client-side plumbing (like System.Data.SqlClient) should be tested under S4U2Self security contexts, and made to work even when things like perf counters cannot be instantiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many other common scenarios will run into the same problem? How can I use PT to connect to a COM+ server if I cannot load the proxy DLL while impersonating an IDENTIFY token? PT outside of the TCB simply does not seem practical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure whether this will help.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Basically, we have a intranet application with web server that's trusted for Kerberos delegation. The idea that certain highly privileged users will pick items from a list on on the web server. The web page will then impersonate the user and use the user's delegated credentials to perform cetain actions on a backend server.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The backend server is firewalled (IPSEC etc.) such that only the web server can communicate with it. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;However, what I find troubling is the fact that  the backend server implicitly trusts the list of items it receives from the web server.
&lt;br /&gt;If the page that creates the list on the web server is compromised, it paves the way for the hacker to perform any action in context of the privileged user (a luring attack of sorts).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;IMO, in such cases, it much better to NOT use delegated credentials and force the highly privileged users to authenticate explicitly to the backend server, confirm the list of actionable items and only then perform the actions using their credentials. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The tradeoff obviously is the risk of exposing some ports on the backend server to the entire intranet vis-a-vis the risk of a luring attack that could result from the compromise of the page on the web server (which is open to the whole intranet). Granted, the confirmation page on the backend server is subject to attacks too, but we have workarounds for it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;What do you think?

&lt;p&gt;This blog has been neglected for the last month - I've been slammed getting ready for &lt;a href="http://www.win-dev.com"&gt;WinDev&lt;/a&gt; (being a track chair is just that much more responsibility) and preparing for &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/events/campsight_server/default.aspx"&gt;Campsight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/events/campsight_server/default.aspx"&gt;Campsight&lt;/a&gt; runs next week (I'm flying up to Redmond tomorrow morning, in fact). So life should get back to normal soon. BTW, we sold this event out at 50 people!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all who attended my security talks at WinDev. Thanks to the speakers who kindly flew out to help as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.leastprivilege.com"&gt;Dominick Baier &lt;/a&gt;gave a great talk on Pen Testing and followed up with a discussion of authorization techniques (which I was sad to miss). Steve Johnson gave a fun talk on Cryptography - it was his first conference talk, and I think he did well! &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhurlbut/"&gt;Robert Hurlbut&lt;/a&gt; showed how to sandbox code in secure appdomains (the most advanced topic of the week, I'd say) and also discussed one of my favorite topics - how to write least privilege apps. &lt;a href="http://www.wiseowl.com"&gt;Brent Rector &lt;/a&gt;stopped by to give a talk on assembly obfuscation - it was great hanging out with Brent after all these years - he's still as funny as ever, and &lt;a href="http://www.wiseowl.com/products/products.aspx"&gt;his product rocks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/fritz/default.aspx"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/fritz" title="Fritz Onion, author of Essential ASP.NET"&gt;Fritz&lt;/a&gt; (one of the other track chairs) kindly threw in a talk on the ASP.NET 2.0 provider model, and I even got to monkey for him at the end. And Mike Woodring helped out with another really advanced topic, security in the face of multithreading. I think he scared most of the attendees with that title - he didn't get nearly the showing that talk should have gotten :-(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up the rest of the slack, throwing in a few talks at the end when some of my speakers had to bow out for one reason or another. This was the first year we had a security track, and if the evals are any indication, we kicked some serious ass this week.

I saw a number of good points, and witnessed firsthand the naivete of the election officials. One official, when asked about recounts, seemed to think that the electronic systems would be better because you'd get the same count you got last time. She seemed to think that it was a problem that the Florida recounts actually led to different outcomes in 2000. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One section of the program talked about the leak of some older Diebold voting software that was analyzed at &lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute. The technical director said, &lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;"It was far below state-of-the-art. I would say it was just, they had absolutely no idea what security is about." Diebold claims that the leaked software was a prototype and was never used in real voting machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a discussion of tampering, they showed seals on the machine that would need to be broken in order for tampering to occur. So I guess if I want to tilt election results in favor of the Democrats, say, I break as many of those seals as possible on machines used in heavily Republican precincts. Call it a selective denial of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the scariest part of the whole thing was the lack of understanding that people have about security with respect to these machines. So many officials seem to think that it's OK to not have any sort of paper trail. I think that's just insane. The fact that the machines don't incorporate some sort of paper trail leads me to believe that the people designing them aren't as smart as the people who design ATM machines, which do a fine job of providing a paper trail for each transaction. Look, the people designing electronic voting machines should be EXCEPTIONAL, not just average. One suggestion during the episode was that since these folks are building systems that effect national security (a presidential election, yea) they should even be required to have significant security clearances, which would at least ensure background checks on the participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands now, the software (which will run the voting machines up to 45 million people will be using on Tuesday) is considered a trade secret, and not even the election officials using the machines are allowed to look at it. So you're trusting Diebold and friends to do the background checks that the government should be doing. Imagine the widespread vote fraud that would result if malicious code somehow found its way into the software that's installed on all these machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is severely misplaced trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;”The ideal voting system would minimize the number of translation steps, and make those remaining as simple as possible. My suggestion is an ATM-style computer voting machine, but one that also prints out a paper ballot. The voter checks the paper ballot for accuracy, and then drops it into a sealed ballot box. The paper ballots are the "official" votes and can be used for recounts, and the computer provides a quick initial tally. Even this system is not as easy to design and implement as it sounds.”&lt;/p&gt;

We just have paper. No machines involved in the voting or counting, at any stage of the process (OK, after the ballot papers are printed). This allows a most important characteristic: human judgement. All candidates, their election agents, and their "counting agents" are allowed to attend the sorting and counting of the ballot papers; the supervising officer is a local council appointed official (usually the council's chief executive or town clerk), and the counting staff are volunteers. This should make it a lot harder to commit fraud. Even the largest districts in a general election have fully counted the ballots and recorded results within a day of polls closing, including regions like the Highlands and Islands where ballot boxes have to be carried by ferry to the mainland before counting.

&lt;br /&gt;I can see the case to automation for more complex counting systems, e.g. single transferable voting.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Why not have the machine print the persons vote on their voting slip, the vote should be printed both in English and a bar code.  The counting machine could then just read all the bar codes from the paper, this will make the result easy to check, and be simple enough that all voter can understand why the vote was far.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;You also need a legal system you can trust, e.g. own that is one owned by a single party.

I assume this varies from place to place, but I don't recall that I've ever been asked for so much as a driver's license when I've gone to vote--I give my address and then, since my name is unusual, I usually just end up pointing to the ledger, "it's that one, third from the bottom...there...thanks!" It's hard to imagine it would be difficult to misrepresent oneself with just a little prepartion and poise, and while this doesn't make it easy to add new ballots or change submitted ballots, the potential for abuse is clearly there.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This is not to suggest that I think the risks in electronic voting are being overblown, particularly because of the potential there for essentially invisible tampering on large scales, which would be logistically challenging with non-electronic systems. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Still, I don't think we should just use the current systems to set the bar, because that seems short-sighted as well.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="3102"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>3146</id><published>2004-11-02T11:41:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-11-02T11:41:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Do you have the latest version of Password Minder</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Check the About box. The latest version (&lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/tools.aspx"&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;) is 1.5.0.4. Please make sure you're using the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I mention this is that I just got my first email from a user who ran into a problem that caused him to lose data. He'd just changed a few passwords (auto-generated them) and before closing PWM (it saves all your changes when you close it down), he ran the export feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out that 1.5.0.2 (the version he was running) had a bug in the export function that caused an unhandled exception. So before his password file was updated, PWM crashed. He'd already changed his passwords at the sites though, so he'll have to go reset them now since the changes weren't stored to his password file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular bug was fixed awhile back, and based on his feedback, I'm going to look into adding a top-level exception handler that offers to save your password file to a location of your choice if it's going to crash. But in the meantime, it'd be a good idea to use this as a reminder to download the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;

I realize I'm not quite as secure, keeping my pw file open, but I would think the risk is small that another process would steal my PW's from memory on XP.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;BTW, no need for this:
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;crawls back into hole with tail between legs&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;PWM is a terrific product. I've quit using a product that cost me $29 and now use PWM exclusively because I think it's more secure and I'm sure I can trust you and I can examine the source code should I ever feel the need.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;There's one minor problem I've been having. The F5 function key doesn't copy the PW into the PW text box.  This worked for awhile after I started using PWM, but then stopped (can't relate it to anything definitely, but I have upgraded to XP SP2).  Copy to the clipboard and paste is my workaround.  And I'm getting by ok with that, but just thought I'd mention the problem in case you know of a solution.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="3146"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>3179</id><published>2004-11-04T03:27:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-11-04T03:27:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Do you have the latest version of Password Minder</title><content type="html">Thanks for the great software Keith.

&lt;br /&gt;Not that it would have helped in the case you mentioned, but the importance of keeping backups of that xml file cannot be stressed enough.

&lt;br /&gt;I have several copies - on my key chain Thumb drive, Pocket PC and off site DVD backups. The terror of losing access to sites meant I used to use the same passwords on many sites.

This morning, &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/aaron" title="Aaron Skonnard, MSDN columnist: XML Files"&gt;Aaron&lt;/a&gt; started off by motivating Service Orientation and contract-first development, and yet again, we see many people who think contract-first is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/aaron" title="Aaron Skonnard, MSDN columnist: XML Files"&gt;Aaron&lt;/a&gt;'s talk, the attendees got some hands-on experience with the Whitehorse tools for designing service oriented systems. Neat stuff! I'll be happier when the tools start talking more about messages as opposed to methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the lab, Bill Gibson (the lead program manager for the tool we just worked with) gave a talk on contract-first development, and it's clear that he and his team are committed to moving the tools in the right direction. Hopefully he'll be able to swing it. I liked his idea of using code-first to prototype, which gives you a great starting point for switching into contract mode, focusing on the messages, and building a real contract that has broad reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/images/blogged/CampsightBill_Gibson2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later today, &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/aaron" title="Aaron Skonnard, MSDN columnist: XML Files"&gt;Aaron&lt;/a&gt; will give some practical advice on using ASMX and WSE, and I'll be delivering a talk on securing integrated applications, focusing on getting to Windows integrated security as soon as possible. I strongly believe that the quicker you can get to integrated authentication, the better off you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security lab tonight is going to be the most challenging (infrastructure-wise) we'll be doing this week. We'll be switching everyone to run inside a domain (this of course means switching to a new DHCP server, DNS server, etc. for the entire classroom, joining all machines into the domain, and adding accounts for 50 students). With the students helping out, this should go quickly and smoothly. After that, the students will contact our integrated certificate authority to install certificates for their web servers, and obtain personal certificates for client authentication. We'll then use these certs to establish mutual authentication from a web browser to a web portal application which will convert the client cert into a Kerb logon using protocol transition, impersonate that logon, and connect to a remote SQL Server box. This is a really interesting lab because it shows one of the best ways of integrating external applications with Windows integrated security. It's also pretty tricky to setup in an ad-hoc classroom environment. Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>3217</id><published>2004-11-07T22:07:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-11-07T22:07:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">The Inaugural .NET Campsight (the day after)</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="3169"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>3361</id><published>2004-11-09T17:29:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-11-09T17:29:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">The Inaugural .NET Campsight (the day after)</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="3169"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>3195</id><published>2004-11-05T10:52:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2004-11-05T10:52:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Campsight day five</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow, what a great week. We have had such great feedback from our first fifty students that I'm really excited about the prospects for Pluralsight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is really all about futures. We had the VSTS product team come in and talk about the new things happening in the tools space, and saw some amazing demos of how we'll be able to do configuration and deployments in the future. You have to see this stuff to believe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IIS 7 team came by and gave a talk and answered questions - it's great to see the IIS configuration model being integrated with the ASP.NET integration model. Going to one place to configure that stuff will really help avoid a lot of the confusion we see today. Imagine configuring modules (both managed and unmanaged) from one config file -  no more ISAPI filters :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin the new year, I've got a number of projects underway:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm working on a new week-long security class (we should have a module outline up on the server real soon now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm preparing for Campsight II, which is happening at the &lt;a href="http://www.redmondtowncenter.com/"&gt;Redmond Town Center&lt;/a&gt; Marriott (it's an awesome venue if you've never been to Redmond - loads to do when you get done with class in the evenings). As usual, we'll be weaving security topics throughout the entire week, which covers contract-first web service development, BizTalk, ASP.NET 2.0 (we're adding coverage of SharePoint) among a host of other topics. But we'll also have some modules that are dedicated entirely to the topic of security, covering such tricky issues as Kerberos delegation and protocol transition in Windows Server 2003. The last event sold out, so &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/events/campsight_server/default.aspx"&gt;sign up today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm writing several security-related articles for the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/smartclient/"&gt;Smart Client dev center&lt;/a&gt;, and continuing to write Security Briefs for &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/default.aspx"&gt;MSDN Magazine&lt;/a&gt;. The next column to be published focuses on some work I've done integrating the GUI ACL Editor into managed code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During January, I'll undertake a brief consulting project that will attempt to integrate the .NET Framework into some rather low-level security plumbing in Windows. Due to an NDA, I'm not sure how much I“ll be able to talk about it, but it looks to be a very interesting little project. More on it later, if I can say anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and my security clearance for the US Govt. is about to go through, so pretty soon I'll be teaching classes for some agencies whose names I'm not yet even allowed to know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the prospects we're looking at, Pluralsight is set for a very strong year. Thanks to all who have supported us so far!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>4899</id><published>2005-01-11T13:07:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-01-11T13:07:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Deleting system DLLs</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent part of the day today working on some system deployment tools, and I came across a case where I needed to delete a system DLL that's always in use. Since it seems that every year or so I find myself needing to know this, here's a good algorithm for doing it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Rename the existing file (foo.dll --&amp;gt; foo.deleteme or something like that). This can be done while the DLL is in use, and it allows you to copy up the new file beside the old, locked one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Copy the new file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Call MoveFileEx(oldFile, null, MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT) to schedule the old file for deletion at the next reboot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Reboot the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there's one gotcha - if you are doing a remote deploy, MoveFileEx doesn't work with remote paths. But all MoveFileEx does is sets a value in the registry to schedule the deletion. Here's the key you should look for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and the value (which normally does not exist) is named PendingFileRenameOperations, which is a MULTI_SZ registry value. This value contains pairs of strings which represent the source and destination for the move. The destination is an empty string in the case of a delete. REGEDIT.EXE complains if you try to do this manually, by the way, but it works fine programmatically. Just be sure to preserve any entries that were there before you got to this key!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note the format of the filename in this registry value must be a local path (c:\windows\system32\foo.dll, for example) and it must be prefixed with a funky string: “\??\”. So an example entry for deletion would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;string 1: “\??\c:\windows\system32\foo.dll”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;string 2: “”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's somewhat kludgy, but you can set this key remotely, and call InitiateSystemShutdown to remotely reboot the machine. Of course you must be able to be authenticated and authorized as an admin on the remote box to do any of this stuff!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>4976</id><published>2005-01-14T11:00:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-01-14T11:00:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Deleting system DLLs</title><content type="html">Keith, if I'm not mistaken, you've described the inner workings of the inuse.exe (Inuse.exe: File-In-Use Replace Utility) tool you guys (Microsoft) have available in your website.

  LONG_PTR x = 0;
  SetWindowLongPtr(0, 0, x);
}&lt;/WINDOWS.H&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, forget the fact that the above code doesn't do anything useful. But you'd expect it to compile without a warning, right? Well, compile it with the default Visual C++ options /Wp64 at a warning level of 4 and you're treated to the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;cl -c -Wp64 -W4 test.cpp
warning C4244: 'argument' : conversion from 'LONG_PTR' to 'LONG', possible loss of data&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't figure out why SetWindowLongPtr wouldn't actually &lt;i&gt;take&lt;/i&gt; a LONG_PTR. Based on this warning it appears to take a LONG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had a peek at the WINUSER.H header file at the actual function declaration. Turns out that there's &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; definitions, depending on whether a preprocessor switch (_WIN64) is defined. I'll summarize:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#ifdef _WIN64
LONG_PTR SetWindowLongPtr(
    HWND hWnd,
    int nIndex,
    LONG_PTR dwNewLong
);
#else
#define SetWindowLongPtr SetWindowLong
#endif
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I searched all the header files in Visual Studio to see if any of them actually define _WIN64, but none do, so I'm assuming this is something defined at compile time by a 64 bit compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it just me, or are the header files somewhat broken in VS.NET 2003? The /Wp64 switch is supposed to spit out warnings if you're doing stuff that would cause you trouble with a 64 bit compiler. But calling SetWindowLongPtr is the &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; thing to do for 64-bit compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anybody else run into this? Did you just give up and turn off the /Wp64 switch, or did you find a cleaner workaround? Or am I just doing something really stupid?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>10</thr:total></entry><entry><id>4944</id><published>2005-01-13T16:11:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-01-13T16:11:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: SetWindowLongPtr and /Wp64</title><content type="html">&lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/fritz" title="Fritz Onion, author of Essential ASP.NET"&gt;Fritz&lt;/a&gt; pointed out in a private email that there's a discussion of this issue on the off-topic list:

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The website you pointed out already explains the cause of the problem, but here's another source that speaks about it:
&lt;br /&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/01/08/bugslayer/
&lt;br /&gt;"The final new warning switch is /Wp64 to help you find 64-bit portability errors. I've found /Wp64 to be quite helpful, except that the SetWindowLongPtr/GetWindowLongPtr macros, which are supposed to aid 32- and 64-bit access, are defined wrong when doing 32-bit compiles. So with /Wp64, you will have extra warnings around them unless you turn them off with the #pragma warning directives."
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I get around the issue merely by using #pragma warning directives to disable the warning for that single line of code.  I break apart any lines of code with multiple function calls (such as SetWindowLongPtr being a parameter into another function) to ensure I surround ONLY that one line of code, so as not to hide another legit warning of the same type.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Take care,
&lt;br /&gt;

A lot of people who normally run as an admin but feel bad about it got really excited about this (article rating 9 out of 9, good work Mike!). One thing that stood out in these articles was the use of the SAFER infrastructure (this is an internal codename for the Software Restriction Policies feature that was added in WinXP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAFER is a system for constraining unmanaged code that is similar in spirit to Code Access Security in the .NET Framework. Certain functions (like CreateProcess and LoadLibrary) have special code to check SAFER policy when loading executable code. They gather evidence about the code (hash value, authenticode certificate, URL, etc.), present it to SAFER policy, and decide what level of privilege should be granted to the code. Sound familiar, .NET programmers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the big difference has always been that (at least to my knowledge), SAFER only supported two levels of privilege: UNRESTRICTED and DISALLOWED. Pretty simple. Code either is allowed to run with all the permissions of the user who launched it, or it's not allowed to run at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And until Mike's article, as far as most of us knew, that was all there was to the story. But Mike details three additional levels, which are kind of like the partial trust model in the .NET Framework. I'll leave it to you to read his article for the details, but suffice it to say that there's more to SAFER than the SDK documentation lets on. Just look up SaferCreateLevel in the SDK docs to see what I mean - only the two levels I list above are documented as being usable, but Mike shows a way to get around this by using some other, somewhat less documented levels :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These levels cause new processes to be launched with restricted tokens, in particular, the Administrators group is marked DENY_ONLY, which basically makes the token act like the token for a normal user (assuming you're not also in the Power Users group).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had always assumed that the reason these levels were never documented was due to the problem of luring attacks. Say I'm an email worm and I think I may be loaded into one of these programs that has been crippled by SAFER. What's to stop me from simply sending window messages to Explorer to lure it to do my dirty work for me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The .NET Framework guys went to &lt;strong&gt;major&lt;/strong&gt; lengths to mitigate luring attacks (I'm sure you've heard about CAS stackwalks), but they had the benefit of having a mechansim for verifying the type safety of code. The unmanaged world has no such luxury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm of mixed mind about this new information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Did Microsoft really want this documented? If so, why doesn't the platform SDK tell us about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Are people who jump on this bandwagon going to get a false sense of security and just get nailed by the next generation of virus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically speaking, I'm sure it's a fine idea to use these techniques in the short term, but unless I'm missing something, this really doesn't fix things in the long haul. If enough people start doing this, the bad guys are going to start using the 20 lines of code it takes to exploit one of the many the luring vulnerabilities that are lurking beneath the covers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until someone shows me how SAFER prevents luring attacks, I'm taking these undocumented levels (and the whole idea of restricted tokens) with a grain of salt. Pay close attention to Mike's first paragraph where he says the very best way to protect yourself is to run as a non-admin from day to day, and only log in as an admin for those few times when you need to install software or configure your machine in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it's harder than hell to do this, because &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.GuideBook.WhatIsANonPrivilegedUser"&gt;most programs break when run as non-admin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;The Untrusted level puts new processes into an unnamed job object that uses the JOB_OBJECT_UILIMIT_HANDLES restriction. It prevents the restricted process from obtaining window handles owned by any processes outside the job, therefore protecting them from this type of attack. Try running spyxx as Untrusted; it won't be able to see any windows but its own.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Also, you can't install browser help objects without access of at least the current user. The untrusted level allows only basic well known groups (like Everyone and Users), but not the current user.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I am the admin of a machine. I do not know the user's password. I want to see what his user token looks like when he logs in. I am especially interested in the group and restricted groups and any deny-only SIDs. Can you tell me where to find this information for a user?

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your enlightling article!
&lt;br /&gt;Do you also happen to know how LsaLogonUser can be used with a KERB_SMART_CARD_LOGON structure?  More specifically, the mysterious CspData / CspDataLength fields?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;WinLogon seems to cache the PIN code for a smart card indefinitely; which poses a problem when you change your smart card's PIN code.  As soon as your Kerberos ticket expires, Lsa will get a new one for you (under the sheets), use the old PIN, and therefore block your card.  (It's not smart enough to invalidate its PIN cache when it receives SCARD_W_WRONG_CHV and keeps retrying anyway).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;We figure a call to LsaLogonUser with the new PIN at the time the PIN is changed, might tell WinLogon to use the new PIN.  _If_ that PIN is not stored per logon session, that is...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;BTW, back in the previous millennium, I got you as an instructor at a Developmentor Windows Guerilla course.  It was a great experience!  I don't believe I even ever had a holiday that was so totally refreshing.  :-)

Nice article!  Have been having a lot of debates with myself and others around these ideas as of late, so I toss some more spaghetti on the wall...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;"We can make progress on both fronts by modifying our approach to creating the password equivalent. Instead of using SHA-1(password), we use SHAd-1(password + userName + scopeUri) as the password equivalent.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;userName and scopeUri are salt values. By including the user name as a salt, we limit the scalability of an offline attack by forcing the enemy to attack one password at a time since each account has a different salt."
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This allows us to not “have” to store any salt, as the userName and scopeUri are known for each request.  However, it does not really add anything over using random salt which is recommended for salt.  Instead we could generate 10 bytes (each byte in the 0-255 range) of true random salt and use that instead.  That would also satisfy the requirement that the verifier is different on other sites as each salt is random.  We also note that the only reason for salt is so that the same password will not result in the same verifier in the db – so this forces a new dictionary attack on each verifier.  This does not really hurt me that bad if I am the attacker because I don’t really expect too many people will be using the same PWD anyway.  If I do get one or two, that is nice, but no great bargain.  So we want salt and we want pwd equiv to not be a simple SHA1(password) of the clear password.  Therefore client can send SHA1(userName + password) password equivalent (PWE) to prevent simple dictionary attacks in the pipeline and use SHA1(DBSalt + PWE) as the verifier like (Note this still assumes encrypted channel as recommended):
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Client Password Equiv (PWE) = SHA1(userName + password)
&lt;br /&gt;DBSalt = RandomBytes(10)
&lt;br /&gt;DBVerifier = SHA1(DBSalt + PWE)
&lt;br /&gt;Server Verify logic becomes:   return  ( DBVerifier == SHA1(DBSalt + PWE)  );
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;At user creation, server generates random salt bytes and adds the PWE and hashes that.  Verifier is stored along with the salt in the db.  When a client sends PWE, the DB salt is pre-pended and hashed and compared to Verifier.  This also eliminates the need for the client to request the salt and scopeUri before hand - so I don't have to publish either or worry about canonical forms for user names, etc.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;"scopeUri is simply a string that is unique to your password database. This ensures that the password equivalents you are using are different from those that another site uses. Neither of these salts is secret. An attacker gains no additional benefit by discovering their values."
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But if I am the attacker and have all the salts and the verifier, I gain great benefit by having all the inputs I need to perform the crack (minus the clear password).  So it does not really slow my algo down much to append the salt(s).  To this point, it could be interesting to *protect the salt by encryption.  Thinking out load...Say you have a Salt Admin and a Salt Service/program.  This elected person is not an Admin.  A service on the machine runs under Salt admin account - this account pwd is super long and totally random.  The service's one public API is to take a PWE and the encrypted salt string and return the Verifier bytes.  The caller can verify returned bytes against DBVerifier as above.  Now you need the salt admin and DB admin to get together to crack db passwords.  Just a thought, could have various forms.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;With all this discussion of user databases, I still wonder how great it is to require thousands of companies to build and maintain separate databases when we already have this cool thing called AD?  We can leverage helpdesk, password policies, pwd change requests, etc. using existing AD tools that most people will already be familiar with.  Naturally this does require we have the *clear pwd in our verify logic as we have to call Win32s LogonUser to verify username/pwd.  Naturally, we will encrypt the pwd at the client using the server's public key or session key.  And we have to somehow reduce the amount of code that has access to the clear pw in the server pipeline.  Have some thoughts on that, but probably another discussion.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Considering all above, I would probably not allow UsernameTokens at all!  But instead require SecurityContextTokens only.  All methods will require at least a signed SOAP body that is signed with an *authenticated SCT (or Derived SCT) - nothing else is allowed.  Now you can focus attention strictly on the mechanics of how the SCT is generated and securing the pwd within that negotiation period. I have a soap.tcp implementation of this at:

That's a very interesting change in the least persistant information needed by the server.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;You've stressed the importance of protecting the signatures produced by password equivalents. That probably applies to all usernametoken signatures even if the password equivalent is not sent or if a one time hash is sent instead. I could be missing something but I couldn't see a wse supported policy construct that enforced that.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So I made a policy statement! It spins through elements - for each signature, if the signingtoken is encrypteddata, the signiture must also be encrypteddata with the same token.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;There is a potential problem with the method you describe in "A Non-Solution: Sending Username Tokens in the Clear":
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;... You must also document a canonical form for user names, or silly things like case insensitivity will case some users to fail authentication.&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Doing something like translating the user name to lowercase is problematic since such a transformation is culture-dependent. I might be tempted to use String.ToLower(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture), but this is only defined on the .NET platform. For example, there would be no way to guarantee that you would produce the same lowercase representation using Java.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I suppose it might be possible to gather some bits from the user name in a culture-independent way, but my point is that the obvious solution might not work.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="5526"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>10553</id><published>2005-06-07T10:44:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-06-07T10:44:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: New Article: Securing the Username Token with WSE 2.0</title><content type="html">Andy,
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Yep, the whole naming problem is something that I brought up when Hervey first suggested incorporating the user name into the hash. I immediately thought of the issues one would have canonicalizing the name: user names are almost universally not case sensitive, so I figured canonicalization would make that problematic, especially given localization issues.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;That's why it's part of my "non-solution" ;-)</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="5526"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>5558</id><published>2005-02-02T13:43:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-02-02T13:43:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Digital BlackBelt webcast series targets security</title><content type="html">&lt;table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, I've been recommending that folks use SHA-256 based on &lt;a href="http://www.schneier.com/book-practical.html"&gt;Ferguson and Schneier&lt;/a&gt; (if you are writing crypto code, please read this book). My guess is that a lot of folks will be moving in this direction soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>5911</id><published>2005-02-16T09:27:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-02-16T09:27:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: SHA-1 Broken</title><content type="html">NIST requires the federal government to move to SHA-256 or SHA-512 by 2010.

&lt;p&gt;I know I was. My premise has always been that the supermarkets raised their prices, then offered “discounts” to people who submitted to having their purchases tracked. I recently ran across someone who did &lt;a href="http://www.nocards.org/savings/krogerads.shtml"&gt;a little study&lt;/a&gt; when those cards went into effect to see what sort of discount he was really getting (granted this guy has an agenda, but his results are not terribly surprising to me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why I really enjoyed &lt;a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/pranks/safeway/ultimate_shopper.html"&gt;this prank&lt;/a&gt;, where a guy has created a system to allow you to use &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; card instead of your own:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;With these concerns in mind, I've made a habit of these simple steps to help keep my grocery-shopping anonymous: 1)  I sign up with an alias and 2) I swap cards regularly with friends.&lt;/em&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now I want to try something different. I want to take the credit for all of my shopping, and for your shopping too!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more serious note, recently a Washington firefighter felt the brunt of the supermaket card, when his purchase records were &lt;a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/security_risks.html"&gt;used by the police&lt;/a&gt; to charge him with arson. If you weren't thinking much about this invasion of privacy, perhaps you will after reading &lt;a href="http://www.komotv.com/stories/32785.htm"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; fellow's &lt;a href="http://www.komotv.com/news/story.asp?ID=35019"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lyons' arrest came after detectives learned a grocery store card in his name showed he had purchased several fire starters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;It is helpful for companies to have information on customers so that they can better target things to you. In this case it is an under the counter, sneaky operation where they are basically milking you without providing much of a benefit (actually, they are probably lowering the cost of annoying means of advertising to the point where they are justifiable).
&lt;br /&gt;However, if I was being offered more, I would find it valuable. For example, if my grocery store provided a download into Money 2005 that would provide me a detailed list of what I purchased that enabled me to evaluate how much I would save if I went to the generic brand, that would be a nice tradeoff for me. The collection of data also needs to be explicit. I would prefer that the information on me have certain privacy guarantees -- I would allow the generic information that did not identify me individually different restrictions than the selling of my address, etc.
&lt;br /&gt;The problem here is not the information, it is that the informtation is controlled by the wrong people and that the whole idea of what information is being collected for what purpose is done in a deceptive way.
&lt;br /&gt;WRT the fire-fighter, this is just another tool that law enforcement should have, given proper warrants and the like. This is a problem of an overzealous prosecuter, not supermarket cards. I would presume that you would not object to the prosecuter using receipts found in someone's house if they had been obtained with a proper warrant -- it is the misuse of that evidence that is objectionable.

&lt;br /&gt;And I think Keith's point is more about an invasion of privacy.

&lt;br /&gt;What bugs me about the supermarket thing is the way they went about it. They basically forced people to use the cards or pay higher prices. But most people don't think about their privacy until an event occurs that shows how dangerous these sorts of databases can be (being arrested on false charges, for example).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The data itself is not dangerous. The danger lies in who is allowed to use it.

&lt;br /&gt;I think the answer to the question is that they wouldn't have been able to do it (except maybe by sending a letter to *all* members), and I can't figure out what the subsequent statement is trying to say.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Costco sent letters to members who had bought packages of almonds that Costco used to import and sell.  Members who brought those packages back got refunds.  How would Costco have managed it before they had cards, Costco would have depended on customers being honest, honesty would have been the way for customers to know that Costco was recalling the almonds, sorry I just don't get it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Yes I understand the privacy concern, but I was just pointing out that it cuts both ways.  If the store didn't have records then it would have been a lot tougher for them to notify customers.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;When car manufacturers discover serious defects that need to be repaired, they're supposed to inform customers about recalls.  Manufacturers other than Mitsubishi Motors obey this law.  How could they do it if they didn't have records?  Customer honesty wouldn't be a substitute.  The honesty of customers of Mitsubishi Motors didn't bring them the information that Mitsubishi Motors was illegally neglecting to recall cars.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; The data itself is not dangerous. The danger
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; lies in who is allowed to use it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Half of a bingo for that.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But they would. We simply haven't had Supermarket 'loyalty' cards that long, life went on before we had the cards, there were product recalls before we had the cards. In the 'old' days firms would have advertised in the press and put up posters in stores, we don't need loyalty cards for this, sure, it may make life easier in this particular respect, but we don't *need* loyalty cards to manage recalls.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; didn't have records? 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'm not sure this is realistic either. Does everybody own new cars? If not, how do manufactures contact those folks that bought second-hand cars? I would guess that the number of people that are contacted directly by manufactures is much lower than the total number of people that own the model that is being recalled. So how do manufacturers contact those people, same way Costco would, advertising and informational campaigns.

&lt;p&gt;I'm curious how many of you are doing it, and what challenges you've come across. The reason I ask is that I'm currently working on an article for the Smart Client developer center on the topic of writing managed applications that run with partial trust, and I want to make sure I'm addressing as many real world concerns as I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you leave a comment describing your successes and difficulties, please also consider emailing me via my contact link (on the left pane of my blog).

&lt;br /&gt;Partially coded exclusive almost trust?

The first is called Writing Secure Code, and it's all about developers getting together and sharing war stories and tips on building bulletproof systems. Here's the description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bring your questions as well as your experiences to this interactive discussion. Participants will share what techniques they are using to ensure bulletproof implementations, including third party tools. Also on the agenda will be the top threats that developers need to worry about when writing code. Remember, it's not just the guys calling security APIs that need to worry about this! Anyone writing code to access valuable assets should care about this topic, so let's have a big turnout!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is called Writing Partially Trusted Code, and is designed to help answer questions people may have when writing apps that run with partial trust. Here's the description for that session:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Writing partially trusted code can be tricky. But a lot of people feel that it's an important tool in our security arsenal: by running with only the permissions we need, the CLR puts walls around our apps to help ensure we can't be tricked into doing something we didn't intend to do. Come discuss the pros and cons of running under partial trust. There are a lot of gotchas, so if you've had experiences, we'd love to hear about them. And if you're just considering taking on the challenge of writing partially trusted code, you'll get a great head start by joining us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhurlbut/"&gt;Robert Hurlbut&lt;/a&gt; beat me to the punch and submitted a BOF on developing code as a non-admin. You can bet I voted for that one as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, none of these sessions will happen unless enough people vote for them. So if you think any of these would be useful for developers, please &lt;a href="http://www.msteched.com/cfp/bofvoting.aspx"&gt;vote early, vote often&lt;/a&gt;, and I'll see you all at TechEd!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>6643</id><published>2005-03-10T15:45:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-03-10T15:45:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">TechEd Security BOFs</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="6638"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>6655</id><published>2005-03-11T06:12:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-03-11T06:12:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">TechEd BOF on async request processing</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="6638"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>6641</id><published>2005-03-10T12:27:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-03-10T12:27:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Kerberos in Windows Server 2003</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Someone pointed me to &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/technologies/security/kerberos/default.mspx"&gt;a new site&lt;/a&gt; on Kerberos in W2K3.

It's simple, will take like 2 minutes of your time, but would be greatly appreciated by the CLR guys.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;For one customer, one of my colleagues is using C# to control two external pieces of equipment via serial ports, so he has had to do some threading and interacting with serial card drivers.  I don't know his real application though.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;One customer asked me[*] to write a DLL to be callable from VB, and subsequently it turned out to be for both VB6 and VB2003, so I gave sample client applications in both languages calling the DLL.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In fact in the case I worked on here is some feedback for the CLR people.  40 years ago PL/I let the programmer specify lower bounds for array indices.  10 years ago Microsoft allowed it too, though in VB not PL/I.  And Microsoft allowed it in ODL files too.  When Microsoft says that Microsoft has lost the technology to do it, Microsoft continues earning Microsoft's reputation.  Sure programmers can put minus signs and constants (or variables) in every array access, just like we do in C.  Microsoft never misses an opportunity to push people who are neutral (in some way or other) into enemy camps.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="6720"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>6722</id><published>2005-03-14T18:48:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-03-14T18:48:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: SURVEY: Who is building or shipping .NET applications today?</title><content type="html">Thanks for helping out, but would you mind going to the survey wiki page instead of leaving comments here?

&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, however, I believe that the .NET Framework is an excellent step forward (in terms of development time, etc.), but I've received feedback from potential customers requesting my applications to be available in other binaries, such as Win32 or Java.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Also, I've added myself to your list of vendors that offer .NET-based applications -- so I hope you don't mind.

He points out that the following code...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;WindowsImpersonationContext ctx = identity.Impersonate();
try { DoWork(); } finally { ctx.Undo(); }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... has a subtle hole - if an untrusted caller is above you on the stack somewhere, and if he can cause DoWork to throw an exception for some reason (perhaps by temporarily exhausting some resource that DoWork needs), he can run arbitrary code in the context of an exception filter (e.g., the Where clause in VB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's right. This is very subtle. But it applies to many more situations than just impersonation. If you are being called by untrusted code, then you have to assume that this trick can be used to run arbitrary malicious code in the middle of any of your routines. What happens if your state is inconsistent at the moment an exception filter runs? We often use finally blocks to clean things up before we leave the “safety” of a private function. Now we discover that our classes need to worry about reentrancy by potentially malicious code anytime they call a function that could throw an exception?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is crazy. It seems to me that untrusted code should not be *allowed* to install exception filters in the first place. But the following code runs just fine under the "Internet" permission set:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;' VB console application that attacks a C# class library using an exception filter
Imports ClassLibrary
Module Module1
    Sub Main()
        Dim victim As New Victim
        Try
            victim.Update(2, 3)
        Catch When ExploitCode(victim) = True
        End Try
    End Sub
    Function ExploitCode(ByVal victim As Victim) As Boolean
        Console.WriteLine("ExploitCode calling back into victim. IsConsistent returns {0}", victim.IsConsistent)
        Return True
    End Function
End Module
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is the class under attack (totally benign, but it makes the point). Someone outside this class should never see FALSE returned from IsConsistent. But that's exactly what happens when the VB console app above calls into the code below, because it can reenter the Victim class whenever an exception is thrown (even a &lt;em&gt;handled&lt;/em&gt; exception!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;using System;
namespace ClassLibrary {
    public class Victim {
        int a = 0;
        int b = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        public void Update(int newA, int newB) {
            try {
                sum = newA + newB;
                doWork();
                a = newA;
                b = newB;
            }
            finally {
                // ensure state is consistent before we leave
                sum = a + b;
            }
        }
        public bool IsConsistent() {
            return sum == a + b;
        }
        private void doWork() {
            throw new ApplicationException("whatever");
        }
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that the attacker is able to run code between the guarded block and the finally block. The author of this class clearly didn't expect this. One solution is to use a catch block instead of a finally block. That would prevent the attacker's exception filter from running. I wonder if the BCL team thought about this? Time to break out Reflector and search for finally blocks in their code, because if they didn't think about this, there's very likely some vulnerabilities just waiting to be discovered by partially trusted code.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>12</thr:total></entry><entry><id>7151</id><published>2005-03-31T09:47:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-03-31T09:47:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Exception filters considered dangerous</title><content type="html">This makes me feel better about my usual model of "if you're in my process, I'm hosed anyway, so I only guard stuff from outside."

&lt;br /&gt;Do you use exception filters? 
&lt;br /&gt;If so, be aware that the code in a filter higher in the call stack can run before code in a finally block. Check that you do not rely on state changes in the finally block, because the state change will not occur before the exception filter executes.

Of course, catching and rethrowing everywhere makes debugging a bear.  In my code where I safely revert the impersonation, (http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnfa/archive/2005/03/24/401905.aspx), I use the same trick that the attacker uses.  Namely, installing an exception filter so that I can revert state on the first pass of handling, yet not interfere with the exception state at all.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;you've basically allowed the insertion of a 'catch' block. Seems to break the idea of 'incapsulation'.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;as to the impersonation (which i'm not that familiar with) issues, why does that request grant permission to all 'assemblies'. shouldn't it only grant that priveledge to the one requesting permission? at least by default? it would obviously also need to allow system assemblies...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;or would there be a problem with this that I don't see?

At a request from some of the bloggers at pluralsight.com, I've implemented a simple &lt;a href="http://www.captcha.net"&gt;CAPTCHA&lt;/a&gt; solution to help us distinguish humans from spambots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm dogfooding my own solution here, so if you have a moment, try it out by posting a comment on this thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is opt-in for bloggers at pluralsight.com; for most of us the server-side heuristics are blocking spam just fine, so we won't need to turn on this feature.

&lt;p&gt;It'll be interesting to see if any bots are able to break through our very simple image generation technique (I used the &lt;a href="http://www.codeproject.com/aspnet/CaptchaImage.asp"&gt;routine posted on codeproject.com&lt;/a&gt; for the image generation).

using System;
using System;
class App {
  static void Main() {
    AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException +=
      new UnhandledExceptionEventHandler(Handler);
    Run();
  }
  static void Run() {
    try {
      Console.WriteLine("Throwing.");
      throw new Exception();
    }
    finally {
      Console.WriteLine("Finally.");
    }
  }
  static void Handler(object sender, UnhandledExceptionEventArgs args) {
    Console.WriteLine("Unhandled exception handler, exiting process");
    Environment.Exit(1);
  }
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's the results of running it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;215 C% test1
Throwing.
Unhandled exception handler, exiting process&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the finally block did not execute, because I terminated the process in the handler (it would have run if I had allowed the process to continue executing, but generally we like to fail fast when an unhandled exception occurs). The interesting point here is that the handler executes before any finally blocks get a chance to execute. This may surprise some people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that if I used a using() statement, Dispose() wouldn't have been called either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a different approach that works fine for a simple single threaded app, and allows the finally blocks to run, and the application simply terminates by returning from Main.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;// test2.cs
using System;
class App {
  static void Main() {
    try {
      Run();
    }
    catch (Exception) {
      Console.WriteLine("Main caught an exception, exiting process");
    }
  }
  static void Run() {
    try {
      Console.WriteLine("Throwing.");
      throw new Exception();
    }
    finally {
      Console.WriteLine("Finally.");
    }

&lt;p&gt;The pipe shows where your cursor ends up after you type that key sequence - you're ready to type your first test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have Beta 2 of VS.NET you really should take a quick look at the &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms165394(en-us,vs.80).aspx"&gt;snippet HOWTO &lt;/a&gt;and the &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms171418(en-us,vs.80).aspx"&gt;snippet schema reference&lt;/a&gt;, so you can create these things yourself. They are trivial to build, and you'll save lots of time in the long run if you codify some of your more repetitive key sequences. The one thing that bums me out is that there are some features (like adding assembly references automatically) that are only supported in VB.NET - bah!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>9675</id><published>2005-05-31T23:57:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-05-31T23:57:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: VS.NET 2005 Code Snippets rock!</title><content type="html">Snippy is a great tool to generate snippets.

&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I'm using NUnit. Why? Because the project started way before VSTS was even close to being usable.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;How do you get NUnit to run on Whidbey? Download the source code and build it against the new framework, fixing the few compiler complaints that pop up. It's pretty easy.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="9673"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>9674</id><published>2005-05-31T23:31:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-05-31T23:31:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">KerberosToken musings</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I remember when I first heard about KerberosToken in WSE2, I wondered what all the fuss was about. I mean, I've always been a proponent of transport security wherever you can use it. I figure that unless you've got a really compelling reason to use WS-Security, you're better off using transport security, for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Admins know how to deploy and manage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) SSL (the spec as well as the many implementations) has been under public scrutiny for years - much longer than any of the WS-* stuff we've seen maturing over the last couple years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) You're a hell of a lot more likely to get good interop using plain ole' SSL. There are sooo many different schemes for securing messages using WS-Security. Without some basic profiles that give toolkit vendors direction, I can't imagine that toolkit X will have much of a chance of unwinding a message secured by toolkit Y. And that's just an interop problem; I'm not even talking about security now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all this, I've been rather reluctant to give WSE's KerberosToken much of a look. But I now find myself considering using it on a project that I'm working on. You see, we're building an SOA architecture where virtually all of the endpoints are using Microsoft infrastructure. Kerberos is an incredibly natural fit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Single sign on rocks. No bugging the user for her cleartext password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Services don't see the client's password, or even a hash thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Kerberos connections are much faster than SSL to establish, and we have very short lived sessions in this system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why am I thinking about using WS-* with KerbToken instead of relying on transport security? Here's the deal: when you use IIS to get Kerberos, you're only getting one very small benefit - the first request includes a header with a Kerb ticket and an authenticator. But the body of the request and subsequent requests have zero protection on them. No integrity protection. No replay protection. No connection hijacking protection. Not even any encryption. If you want any of that stuff, you have to layer on SSL, and to me that's just dumb, because Kerb is perfectly capable of providing ALL those features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what KerbToken gives you - an all in one package that provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication without requiring SSL, along with an opportunity for rich authorization on the back end, including the option to do constrained delegation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other benefit is that I believe I'll be able to bolt on support for UsernameTokenOverX509 when interop scenarios arise. And I will be able to do it without having to change anything significant for a given service. To do that with the current toolkit I'm using would take a bit of custom code on my part, but I'm hoping that'll change sometime soon. Even if it doesn't, that's code I only really have to write once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll let you know how it turns out in about a month after we ship.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>9676</id><published>2005-06-01T01:03:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-06-01T01:03:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: KerberosToken musings</title><content type="html">cool :) so you are at the same point i was half a year ago - where you said i shouldn't use it :))</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="9674"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>9698</id><published>2005-06-01T15:07:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-06-01T15:07:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">ASP.NET 2.0 cryptic error message</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A parser error has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh man. This one had me pulling my hair out. I'm posting this so it'll google for me next time :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem? Simple, according to &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/fritz" title="Fritz Onion, author of Essential ASP.NET"&gt;Fritz&lt;/a&gt; - ASP.NET 2.0 seems to assume that its App_Code directory is right underneath the vroot. Not realizing this, I had pointed my vdir one directory higher, so the URL to my service looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://localhost/vdir/subdir/service.asmx"&gt;http://localhost/vdir/subdir/service.asmx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I think about it, the /bin directory is the same way. Duh! Anyway, hope this saves someone out there some pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and FWIW, look in the Application event log if you have ASP.NET 2.0 errors. If you look closely, you'll see there's a stack trace of the internal exception. That was helpful in tracking down the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>20</thr:total></entry><entry><id>11600</id><published>2005-06-21T10:22:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-06-21T10:22:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: ASP.NET 2.0 cryptic error message</title><content type="html">Just wanted to say thank you.

The SOAP spec defines a reasonable way to do this, but the programming model (SoapException) really makes it painful. Here's what I'm trying to model:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;try {
  int value = LookupSomething("some index");
}
catch (ItemNotFoundException) {
  // certain special exceptions I can recover from
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very common programming construct - in certain cases we can easily recover from an exception, so we create special exception classes (if they don't already exist) to signal these situations. In a web service, you might use the faultstring to signal these sorts of things (the faultcode is controlled by the SOAP spec, so that's not something I want to customize). Well, to do this, you use SoapException, and you can set the SOAP faultstring via the Message property:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;throw new SoapException("ItemNotFound", ...);&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and on the client, you'd expect to be able to read the faultstring:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;catch (SoapException x) {
  if ("ItemNotFound" == x.FaultString)
       recover();
  else throw;
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the problem: there is no FaultString property on SoapException. And if you read the Message property, you'll find your faultstring interspersed with a load of other crap that you don't care about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;tt&gt;System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapException: &lt;b&gt;ItemNotFound&lt;/b&gt; at Foo.LookupSomething(String index) in foo.cs:line 80&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's just peachy. So I guess I can use the detail field to supply a DOM with details about the exception, and the client SoapException won't futz around with that, but my goodness, that's way overkill for what I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I missing something, or did Microsoft simply not consider the client exception programming model? Did they just assume we'd implement all our exception handling blocks with a message box?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>28</thr:total></entry><entry><id>9713</id><published>2005-06-02T15:39:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-06-02T15:39:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: SoapException sucks.</title><content type="html">Have you tried grabbing the .InnerException to look at the original exception thrown?</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="9712"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>9716</id><published>2005-06-02T16:58:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-06-02T16:58:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: SoapException sucks.</title><content type="html">ASP.NET doesn't serialize the actual exception into the SOAP fault packet, so InnerException is always null on the client side.

&lt;br /&gt;One thing you can do is, supply just the XML as a string, and it works in a way very similar to supplying the DOM document (hey afterall it is all XML Serialized).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Not the ideal solution - but close enough.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Good point, but would it be a good idea from a security perspective to change that error mode? Heck, I'd be perfectly happy with just a FaultString property on SoapException. Seems like an oversight to me.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Hey, I'll sit through your web service class if you'll sit through my security class ;-)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahil,
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I solved the problem by creating a little class that maps enums onto nodes in a DOM tree that it caches. Makes it pretty easy to use the Detail field. Just silly that we have to go to this length, IMHO.

Here's the basic outline:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;1.  Define an marker attribute for client-consumable exceptions.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;2.  Create two new exception classes that inherit from SoapException and SoapHeaderException but that hide all the innards (e.g.: stack trace) that shouldn't be exposed to the client.  Apply the attribute from #1 to both classes.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;3.  Create an exception mapper that is capable of mapping any server-side exception that isn't marked with the client-safe attribute to one of the exception types in #2, including massaging the message text as appropriate.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;4.  Wrap each web method body in a try-catch block that uses the method from #3 to map caught exceptions to their client-safe counterparts then rethrows the new exception.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Since SoapExceptions aren't re-massaged by the framework prior to insertion of their data into the response, whatever you choose to have exposed via the ToString method of the custom exception classes created in #2 will be what is sent to the client.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="9712"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>9731</id><published>2005-06-03T05:56:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-06-03T05:56:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: SoapException sucks.</title><content type="html">This details the approach we took for passing exceptions on the wire:

&lt;br /&gt;faultstring: "...It is intended to provide a human readable explanation of the fault and is not intended for algorithmic processing."
&lt;br /&gt;detail: "The detail element information item is intended for carrying application specific error information related to the SOAP Body . It MUST be present when the contents of the SOAP Body could not be processed successfully"
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Interoperable SOAP services therefore more or less require you to follow the approach of providing a detail element complying with a schema defined as part of your service. WSDL has a syntax for defining the schema of detail elements in SOAP faults. However, I think you are right that there is currently no tool support from Microsoft for doing this: no way to emit the WSDL including fault definitions (unless you do it by hand); no server-side programming constructs for ensuring that any SOAP faults generated comply with the detail schema; and no client-side tools for generating code to map fault detail instances to specific client side exception types.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Currently you are more or less forced to catch all exceptions on the server side and construct a suitable SoapException "by hand" (setting faultcode appropriately; ensuring the faultstring doesn't leak sensitive information; and populating the detail appropriately), and on the client side you need to code an explicit mapping of SOAP fault context details to whatever client-side exception handling model your application has. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Such mappings are necessarily application-specific. While wrapper classes such as have been suggested can help, unless they are closely configurable for the application, they can't solve the whole problem. For example, even just to get the faultcode set correctly on the server side - to distinguish server from client errors - application-specific coding is hard to avoid.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="9712"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>9735</id><published>2005-06-03T10:12:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-06-03T10:12:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: SoapException sucks.</title><content type="html">Chris,
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Good point about the SOAP spec. Given that, it appears that not exposing the faultstring was probably a reasonable thing to do. So I guess it sucks a little less than I originally thought ;-)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Indigo has a much more robust way of dealing with faults. You can throw an exception on the server and catch it on the client. Indigo also differentiates between faults that should be thrown to clients and random exceptions that should be dealt with on the server.

&lt;br /&gt;I've built an extension that does that. It even serializes the exception (base64encoded) and passes that along with human readable information.  Not sure if the serialized exception is useful as I already pass the exception type and message.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The soap spec (1.1) also includes:
&lt;br /&gt;faultcode - intended for use by software to provide an algorithmic mechanism for indetifying the fault.
&lt;br /&gt;(for 1.2 see Value element of Code element)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I see the faultcode as the rough equivalent to an exception name while "detail" is the exception contents.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;There are some predefined faultcodes - soap:Client, soap:Sender for instance - but you can define your own:
&lt;br /&gt;xmlns:my = "http://my.com"
&lt;br /&gt;faultcode = "my:ItemNotFound"
&lt;br /&gt;(see XmlQualifiedName)
&lt;br /&gt;and these can be passed as the code parameter to various SoapException ctors.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;See some of the WS specs - like Web services Eventing - for examples of custom faultcodes.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="9712"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>11166</id><published>2005-06-13T11:59:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-06-13T11:59:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: SoapException sucks.</title><content type="html">So Keith, what did your solution ended looking like?</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="9712"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>11311</id><published>2005-06-15T07:02:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-06-15T07:02:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: SoapException sucks.</title><content type="html">I too have struggled with this.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day I agree with some of the folks that you should not turn on inner exceptions. Internally, why your service fails is not something you really want to expose. At the same time, typed exceptions are needed on the client (besides just SoapException or SoapHeaderException). Personally, I think that exception typing should be part of the web service contract.

Really busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hosting our first Pluralsight booth, which is so exciting - it's great to see everything coming together. We recently welcomed &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/matt/"&gt;Matt Milner&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/ted/"&gt;Ted Pattison&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/drjoe/"&gt;Joe Hummel&lt;/a&gt; into our rank of instructors, we're doing some fantastic content development work for Microsoft, and our curriculum is shaping up to be the best in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Dr. Joe Hummel is a college prof, an amazingly smart guy, and great fun at parties for anyone who ever took a VB class with him at our previous training company. He's also the fellow who taught me years ago that user authentication could be broken down into three questions: what do you have, what do you know, and what are you made of -- that was one of those “wow, I get it” moments in my career, Joe)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I sat down to a great sushi dinner the other night with these fellows plus &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/aaron" title="Aaron Skonnard, MSDN columnist: XML Files"&gt;Aaron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/fritz" title="Fritz Onion, author of Essential ASP.NET"&gt;Fritz&lt;/a&gt;, and Bill, I suddenly realized the impact of what we're doing here at Pluralsight. We are bringing together some of the most amazing folks in this industry, and so many of my old friends - it feels like a family reunion. It was a very happy moment for me. Of course the bottle of saki didn't hurt any, either ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's Wednesday night, and I've finished up one of the most stressful and fun nights in my career. Stressful because I delivered a VSTS testing breakout talk that I'd been working on for several weeks on a build of the bits that was very far from being stable, and demoing integration with a third party tool that was also really quite unstable on that build. I had spent many hours of the previous week trying to get a couple portions of my demos to work consistently (even with the kind help of the VSTS team), but the build proved to be too unstable and those two demos failed as they had in the past. Fortunately the audience seemed to take it in stride (I'll see on the evals, I guess ;-) But this was the most stress I've felt about a talk in a LONG time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happily later on in the evening I moderated a couple security-related BOF sessions that went (IMHO) splendidly. In groups of about 15 folks we had very informal and intimate chats about writing partially trusted code, and writing secure code in general. Those were really fun sessions and helped me to decompress after the VSTS talk. Thanks to all who attended!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TechEd 2005 has been a thrill for me in so many ways; if you're here, please stop by our booth and say hello tomorrow. I'll be in the booth most of the day (we're on aisle 200 right across from the beanbag lounge).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check your version number in Help|About - if you've not upgraded in awhile, you should get this latest build. The only change from 1.5.0.5 to 1.5.0.6 is to allow spaces in passwords, but if you've got an older version, note that there have been a number of bug fixes since earlier versions. Be sure to read the README.TXT file to see what's changed from your current version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Is there any reason (from a security p.o.v) why one should not extend Password Minder to store additional info related to a website account in a "notes" fields (or perhaps extra structured fields)?.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking particularly about the security questions/answers and/or passphrases that some sites use in addition to the passwords.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Im an avid user of your Password Minder and think its a great utility.  I was just wondering whether you have thought about storing what characters and maximum password length attributes on a per entry basis rather than always defaulting to the all characters and 20 character length global setting.  Its just I find it increasing annoying trying to find out what is and isnt acceptable for passwords on different sites.  As you have pointed out before some websites are not very helpful in providing this information and it tends to be a game of trial and error before an acceptable password is discovered.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;On a separate note I have only had two cases where upon changing my password for a site it has been accepted only to not let me in on subsequent visits due to an invalid password.  Do you have any tips on avoiding this but still getting the most secure password for the site possible?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I too would be interested in the mods for the notes field and shall email you for them also. Are you aware of any other mods available?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And one final question; do you keep an email list for your user base and email them when you release a new version or is it just up to people to keep checking.  I dont mind, I was just wondering thats all.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Regards

Sometimes what happens is you provide a long password and the site truncates it before storing it, not telling you what they are doing (they simply don't expect you to use a good password!)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I usually adapt the length and complexity of my password for the site I'm using. For a site that I really don't care much about, I just give it an 8 or 10 char password, with no punctuation. That seems to be acceptable just about everywhere. More secure sites seem to take passwords a bit more seriously, so I can use a longer password.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As for notifications, I always post to this blog when a new version comes out, so as long as you're subscribed, you should always be informed.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="11473"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>12919</id><published>2005-07-05T16:06:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-07-05T16:06:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Password Minder 1.5.0.6 released</title><content type="html">running window xp home editon

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Sure - I just ran SGEN on the assembly that contained the web reference. Say that was foo.dll. IIRC SGEN generated a new assembly called foo.XmlSerializers.dll, which I imported into SQL 2005 by calling CREATE ASSEMBLY.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I ended up not taking this route because our services use WSE 3 to do message-level security, and that's not going to be feasible in SQL Server.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="11647"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>11753</id><published>2005-06-23T09:21:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-06-23T09:21:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Calling web services from within SQL Server 2005</title><content type="html">Thanks for the help with sgen.

&lt;p&gt;In summary: you've got to Dispose of individual objects when you get them from a foreach loop. To demonstrate this, the following program prints “Hello world” (note that “Dispose“ is not printed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;using System;
class Foo : IDisposable {
  public void HelloWorld() { Console.WriteLine("Hello world"); }
  public void Dispose() { Console.WriteLine("Dispose"); }
}
class App {
  static void Main() {
    Foo[] a = { new Foo() };
    foreach (Foo foo in a) foo.HelloWorld();
  }
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fix this program, you'd need a try/finally block in the foreach loop that explicitly calls Dispose.

Before I ran into this issue with System.DirectoryServices, I never realized you could put a raw object reference in a using block. I always thought you had to *acquire* the instance in the using block.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In other words:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;using (Foo foo = new Foo()) // legal
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Foo foo = new Foo();
&lt;br /&gt;using (foo)           // also legal
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;...which makes the syntax you suggest really quite natural when consuming collections of short-lived objects like those from S.DS.

&lt;p&gt;Some key points about the attack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The attacker created both the original (signed) document and the forgery. It's a lot easier to engineer two messages that hash to the same value if you can vary both messages arbitrarily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some &lt;a href="http://www.infosec.sdu.edu.cn/paper/md5-attack.pdf"&gt;recent advances&lt;/a&gt; in attacks on MD5 were used in this attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Caesar had made a trivial change to the document before signing it, he would have foiled the attack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're building systems that rely on digital signatures, you'd be wise to consider this type of attack. In my early studies of crypto protocols, I recall learning that signing an untrusted document (i.e. a document that you or a friend did not create) is a really bad idea, and this attack is an example that proves that point nicely.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>12585</id><published>2005-06-26T13:02:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-06-26T13:02:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">And some more interesting finds</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="11766"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>11797</id><published>2005-06-23T17:04:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-06-23T17:04:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Funny comment from a reader</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From time to time MSDN sends me a list of comments from readers for any article they have on their website, from MSDN Magazine to the various dev centers.

&lt;p&gt;What I'm talking about here is sp_reserve_http_namespace, which is a stored proc in Yukon that talks to HTTP.SYS and reserves an endpoint for its use. You need to use this if you want to expose a web service from the database directly (and your instance is running under LUA, good for you), something that I've been experimenting with for a project I'm currently working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where's the sp_release_http_namespace? Or the sp_unreserve_http_namespace function? I poked around the master database but didn't see anything obvious. I just happen to be trying to move the web service to a different named instance of Yukon, and the old instance has a lock on the URL I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, by searching the registry for a fragment of the URL I registered, I noticed that under the services key (HKLM\SYSTEM\CCS\Services), there's a key called HTTP. And under that, there's a subkey at Parameters\UrlAclInfo that has a list of named values, and there I found my registered pattern. I took a chance and deleted the entry with my pattern in it, and rebooted the system. Before rebooting, I tried &lt;strong&gt;net stop HTTP&lt;/strong&gt;, but that just put it in a wacky state - apparently HTTP.SYS is the new RPCSS.EXE - I'll bet someday soon your system will melt if it's not running).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahh, my VPC just started back up. That's a good sign. Regedit shows the value I deleted is indeed still gone. Let's see if the pattern has been successfully unregistered, or if my machine is now toast. Bringing up SSMS and calling sp_reserve_http_namespace from my new instance again... WOOHOO it worked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure Bob will be here soon with the official fix, but this seems to be working for now...&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>11974</id><published>2005-06-24T05:50:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-06-24T05:50:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Yukon and HTTP.SYS</title><content type="html">Keith,
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you're running W2K3 or you have the adminpak installed on XP you can use httpcfg to manipulate the URLs in the HTTP.SYS list. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Use 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;  httpcfg query urlacl 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;to get a list of reserved addresses (and their ACLs).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Use
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;  httpcfg set urlacl -u &amp;lt;URL&amp;gt; -a &amp;lt;ACL&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;to add a URL and ACL to the list (yes, you do need to specify an ACL). e.g.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;  httpcfg set urlacl -u http://192.168.1.111:8088/mystuff -a D:(A;;GX;;;WD)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Use 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;httpcfg delete urlacl -u &amp;lt;URL&amp;gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;to remove a URL from the list. e.g.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;  httpcfg delete urlacl -u http://192.168.1.111:8088/mystuff

Then I just delete the differencing disk when I want to try again. It works nicely (Undo disks would be another option here, but I often want to have more than one branch going at one time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, last night at about 3am (well, this morning, I guess) I was pretty tired and I accidentally pointed my deployment VPC at the base disk image instead of the differencing disk. I deployed onto my clean image. It's not a huge deal, but it wasn't what I'd planned on happening, and it could have been really inconvenient if I'd not had a backup of the base image on another drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on, I'm setting the READ-ONLY flag on my base image. Just tried it and it works like a charm.

Given that SQL Server supports integrated authentication (integrated security=sspi) you'd think that the native TCP/IP library would be able to use SSPI to sign and seal the channel. But they don't, and I find that really odd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, they tell you, if you want to use Kerberos to secure the channel, use the multiprotocol library. That puts another layer between you and SQL Server - now you're communicating over RPC, which can be configured to use SSPI to MAC protect and encrypt the channel. But why do I have to use RPC to get this? Why doesn't the native TCP/IP driver provide these basic protections?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And furthermore, I love the mysterious little caveat you'll find when you go read about using the multiprotocol encryption feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Use Multiprotocol encryption only for compatibility with existing systems. The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption that can be enabled using the Server Network Utility (after running Setup) is a more comprehensive encryption solution.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and this is a nice limitation as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;tt&gt;The Multiprotocol Net-Library does not support named instances of SQL Server 2000. You can use the Multiprotocol Net-Library to connect to the default instance of SQL Server on a computer, but you cannot connect to any named instances.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I bugged by this? Why don't I just use SSL and get in line with everyone else? Because setting up SSL connections is considerably slower than setting up Kerberos connections (think public key operations in SSL versus purely symmetrical operations with Kerb), and it requires certificates and PKI where Kerberos is already built right in to my domain infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want REAL Kerberos support. Not just authentication, but integrity and confidentiality too. And I want it built right in to the native network library for TCP/IP. Is that too much to ask? If someone can tell me this is coming in Yukon, I'd be a very happy camper indeed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>12934</id><published>2005-07-06T13:36:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-07-06T13:36:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">SQL Channel Security, a half-glass problem?</title><content type="html">Keith Brown has a meaty posting on his blog talking about channel security for SQL Server.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'm sure a lot of people agree with you; why would you ever want to protect data that's already protected by perimeter security?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The answer of course is defense in depth; there's a growing number of people who would like to build systems that are resilient to failures, including perimeter security failures.

&lt;br /&gt;As Ferguson points out in Practical Cryptography, "We already have enough fast, insecure systems. We don't need another one." Of course his viewpoint is just one of many. But for those that share it, a consistent Kerb story would certainly make it a lot less painful.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="12930"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>13944</id><published>2005-08-09T17:48:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-08-09T17:48:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">July's winners for most popular blog post</title><content type="html">Blogging has it's rewards.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IIS:&lt;/strong&gt; When you turn on integrated authentication, Kerb is used to communicate client credentials to the server (assuming Kerb is negotiated, which it should be if both client and server are in a v5.0 or greater domain). It is NOT used to provide integrity or confidentiality. Oh, you wanted that? You've gotta layer on SSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SQL Server:&lt;/strong&gt; see my &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/archive/2005/07/06/12930.aspx"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;. In short, Microsoft shies away from using Kerberos and recommends SSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMB (file shares, printers, named pipes):&lt;/strong&gt; Kerb is used to communicate client credentials to the server. You can further configure it (via security policy) to provide integrity protection of the channel. But encryption? Naw, you gotta layer on IPSEC if you want that. You'd think that this would be one of the highest priorities given that it's used by virtually everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RPC and COM+:&lt;/strong&gt; Fantastic support for Kerberos. Siimply adjust the authentication level to Packet Privacy, and you've got authentication, integrity, and confidentiality protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember how much Microsoft touted their use of Kerberos when Windows 2000 shipped. It would be soooo great if the use of Kerb was consistent across the platform. Give me the option to use Kerb's integrity and encryption features. Everywhere. Only then will we truly have “integrated security”.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>12954</id><published>2005-07-07T15:58:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-07-07T15:58:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Microsoft's fragmented Kerberos story</title><content type="html">How about WSE?

You can either use the current security context, or you can pass a user name and password to get a ticket in someone else's name. The beauty of this is that you can use Kerb to provide authentication, integrity, and confidentiality - you don't need SSL. I'd expect you'd see better perf, but you'd have to test to make sure since there's lots of other factors involved.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In an interop scenario you're unlikely to use Kerb, since it isn't typically used across organization boundaries. More likely would be SSL with a UsernameToken as you suggest.

I have been studying their Kerberos implementation and found that you are their primary source of code examples for implementation of the standard.  
&lt;br /&gt;  While its true that their implementation does not share cohesiveness across the implementations; I am particularly under impresed by the "GSSAPI" psuedo-implementation.  In heterogeneous domains this seems to over complicate the development of  TGT passing across OS boundaries. 
&lt;br /&gt;  The lack of implementation direction in their documentation is probably the root of their fragmentation.  In any large product and or suites of products missing examples with no real coding styles leaves them open to entropy.  Though it could also be their marketing dept :)

&lt;p&gt;My point is that if you're going to support Kerberos, go all the way. Give me an option to encrypt and integrity protect the channel using my Kerberos symmetric key. For anyone who has ever worked with SSPI, it sure feels strange to say “integrated security=sspi“ and then have someone tell you that you need to layer SSL on top of that in order to get encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

I confirmed this myself on Friday when I was hacking up some code for a client. Today I looked and found this in the docs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003:  &lt;/strong&gt;You cannot call &lt;b&gt;CreateProcessWithLogonW&lt;/b&gt; from a process running under the LocalSystem account. This is because the function uses the logon SID in the caller token and the token for the LocalSystem account does not contain this SID. As an alternative, use the &lt;b&gt;CreateProcessAsUser&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;LogonUser&lt;/b&gt; functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first read this, I figured it was referring to the logon SID of the new logon, which is typically used to add a grant in the DACL of the winsta / desktop pair where the new process will live. But now that I reread it, clearly it's referring to the &lt;em&gt;caller's&lt;/em&gt; logon SID. I wonder what that could be used for? Securing some temporary object used for communicating between the caller's process and the secondary logon service? Inquiring minds want to know, in case any of my MS readers were involved with this change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, if you're running your service as SYSTEM (tsk tsk tsk) and you want to migrate to W2K3 and XP SP2, I hope you're not calling CreateProcessWithLogonW. If you are and need another way, check out my &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msj/0200/logon/logon.aspx"&gt;5 year old article&lt;/a&gt; (wow, has it been that long?) on doing this the old way using LogonUser / CreateProcessAsUser, etc. Note that since the article was released, (Un)LoadUserProfile was documented. So be sure to use that API instead of the rather complicated approach to bootstrapping the user's environment that I had to follow back in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article comes with a tool called cmdasuser.exe from which you can grab all the code you need to get this going.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>13899</id><published>2005-08-06T11:21:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-08-06T11:21:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: CreateProcessWithLogonW from SYSTEM</title><content type="html">Keith,
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I found that this limitation in the new OS versions is fairly easy to circumvent: First do a LogonUser for the user whose credentials you want to pass to CPWLW. It worked for me with LOGON32_LOGON_NEW_CREDENTIALS and LOGON32_LOGON_NETWORK. Then impersonate the user and now call CPWLW.
&lt;br /&gt;I do not know up to now if this has any side effects, it seemed to work for me.

CPWLW used to tweak the DACL of the caller's winstation/desktop to allow the new process to access it. This wasn't very secure, and presented problems such as how to clean up the added ACEs when the process terminates.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So the new implementation leaves the ACLs alone, and instead injects the caller's LogonId SID into the new process' token, which has a side effect of allowing it access to the desktop.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The system logon session doesn't have a logon id SID so CPWLW fails.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you impersonate some other account before you call CPWLW you can bypass this problem, but you will also not get automatic access to the desktop.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I'm not sure but I think that you might be able to use CPWLW from the system session if you specify a non-NULL lpDesktop, or if you use LOGON_NETCREDENTIALS_ONLY flag on W2K3 SP1 and later, because in these cases CPWLW doesn't care about desktop permissions.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="13368"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>14352</id><published>2005-08-25T10:29:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-08-25T10:29:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: CreateProcessWithLogonW from SYSTEM</title><content type="html">Hi Pavel,
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;you are right. When I did my first attempts to bypass the problem, I made the mistake to use the same credentials as those of the user who was interactively logged in. The service had interaction with the desktop enabled and therefore spawning processes with CPWL from the service worked. But as soon as I specify other credentials, the processes fail if they do UI. I think, in the case of the originating process running as SYSTEM, you now have to manipulate the ACEs of the winsta\desktop DACLS again.

&lt;br /&gt;This is very challenging problem for me. basically my windows service monitor the application  when my application hang due any reason then my service kill that process and application .Then restart the process and application again. 
&lt;br /&gt;So for all this I made the service. Well now come on problem, plz come on controlpannel &amp;gt; Administrator Tool &amp;gt; Service &amp;gt;myservice.Then right click on service and go on properties. There is a property on Log On 
&lt;br /&gt;"Allow Service to interact with desktop". I check this property through coding using vb.net.
&lt;br /&gt;But there is a very big problem when I check this property through code using vb.net then my application is start working but after killing the application due to hang, service start the process on background means GUI of application do not display on user screen, process is running on background(we can see it on task bar of windows ) . 
&lt;br /&gt;But when we do same things manually then every thing is running fine, service kill application or process properly and start it properly and proper GUI display on user screen 
&lt;br /&gt;Please help me to solve this problem.

&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, folks if you forget your master password, there's no way (short of a brute force attack against your own password file) to recover your passwords. There's nothing wrong with writing down your master password as long as you keep the written copy in a secure location! And now would be a fantastic time to reset that master password you've been using for more than a year, and back up your password file as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I decided to dump the easytool version and go with yours for security sake, and the comments feature is just what I needed so thanks for that.  I now find your tool invaluable for my everyday use.  However in the last week or so I have started to notice some very strange behaviour.  If I reset any of my passwords or add comments or generally make some minor changes to entries after some indeterminate period of time the last change seems to disappear.  This has just happened for the 6th time with my hotmail account when yesterday your app prompted me to change my password after the 72 days I had configured and duely did so.  However I have just tried to register for a microsoft event which requires me to log in with my passport account and so as usuall I popped up Password Minder for it to again remind me to change my hotmail password with one day less that yesterday which I thought was funny as I had changed it yesterday but copied the password across to the website anyway only to be told it was incorrect.  Any Ideas on whats going on here?  I've tried to recreate the problem only to fail but its happenning every day pretty much now and getting a little tiresome.  I always keep several backup copies in different locations on different hardware in case of a major loss sometime down the line, but havent done these after every little change - only once a month or so.  Also I must confess I sometime leave the app running for long periods of time and over hibernates - could this be the problem? or previous versions somehow?  I have tested this but havent found the problem.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Any help would be much appreciated!

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I've not seen this before myself. Keep in mind that PWM only writes the password file when you close it (it was designed to be opened and closed each time you need it, so I didn't put a File|Save in there).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;What might be happening is this: you make a password change in an instance of PWM that you leave open for a long time. The change hasn't yet been written to disk. Then you accidentally open another instance of PWM (forgetting that you already have one in the background). That new instance reads the password file, but doesn't see the change... You can see how this would be a problem.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion would be to close PWM whenever you make a change (although I'd recommend keeping it closed whenever it's not in use, but you know that ;-)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Try to make sure you never have two copies of PWM open at the same time (I guess I could add a check for that, but I'm afraid to think of what behavior people would want when the second copy starts - things might get complicated for a simple little program like PWM).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, give that a whirl and see if it clears up your problem.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="14208"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>17329</id><published>2005-12-08T09:18:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-12-08T09:18:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">What is the best way to keep PWM files synchronized?</title><content type="html">I have PWM installed on both my work and home computers.

&lt;p&gt;Let's imagine Alice sends a message to Bob, and her message is signed[1] then encrypted using symmetric keys that Alice and Bob share. Who can read the message once it's encrypted? Only Alice and Bob. Who can verify Alice's signature? Only Alice and Bob. This last point is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Signatures“ formed with a shared (symmetric) key can only be validated by someone who knows the key. Later on, Alice can repudiate her message, “Bob, I never sent that message, you're trying to set me up!“ and Bob has no recourse - an independent adjudicator would simply look at the message and say, “How do I know who actually signed that message, Bob? Both you and Alice knew the signing key!“ For this reason, cryptographers carefully distinguish message authentication codes from digital signatures, but in most Web Service security scenarios, the terminology is rather muddied. XML Signatures can be formed not only with private keys, but also with shared keys (in which case the “Signature“ is really just a MAC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if Alice and Bob use an asymmetric-key system, Alice would sign the message with her private key, and Bob (and anyone else, including the adjudicator from my last example) can verify the signature. Thus Bob gains some measure of “nonrepudiation“. But interestingly enough, Bob also may be losing a security guarantee. Systems that sign and encrypt with asymmetric keys are often subject to an attack called “surreptitious forwarding“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to understand this attack, and the implications for Bob's peace of mind, put yourself in Bob's shoes when he receives a message that was first signed with Alice's private key then encrypted with Bob's public key. Bob decrypts the message, verifies the signature, and what does he know? Alice's signature was intact, so surely she signed the message, but has anyone else seen the plaintext? And was the message really addressed to him? If Alice didn't explicitly include “To: Bob“ in the message, how does Bob know that this message really came from Alice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this scenario: Alice signs the message, “I love you“, encrypts it with Chris's public key, and sends it to Chris. She loves Chris and wants to let him know. Chris, the villian in this story, decrypts the message, and decides to set up Bob for some embarrassment by reencrypting it with Bob's public key and sending it to Bob. When Bob receives “I love you“, signed by Alice and encrypted so only he can read it, he will very likely be fooled! Now, if Alice had thought ahead and instead signed the message, “Chris, I love you“, this “surreptitious forwarding“ attack would have been prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a common misconception that asymmetric cryptosystems are somehow better or more secure than symmetric cryptosystems, but this example shows that of course this is not true; you have to be very careful designing any type of cryptosystem. I'm glad there are people much smarter than I am doing this sort of thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soooo, what does this have to do with anything? One interesting place where these ideas are applied is in WS-Security implementations. If you've ever used WSE to secure a web service, you may have wondered why all those headers are included in the XML signature and not just the body of the message itself. In particular, the WS-Addressing header - why would the sender take the time to sign that? Well, now you know at least one reason why that fragment is signed. That's the equivalent of including “To: Bob“ as part of the signed message. It helps prevent surreptitious forwarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in learning more about challenges in building cryptosystems, my favorite book by far is &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bookpool.com/sm/0471223573&amp;amp;aid=CD24"&gt;Practical Cryptography&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. And for an in-depth look at surreptitious forwarding and the myriad of protocols that are susceptible to it, read &lt;a href="http://world.std.com/~dtd/sign_encrypt/sign_encrypt7.html"&gt;Don Davis's paper&lt;/a&gt; on the topic. Don's point is that many toolkits (and protocols) don't bother to protect against this attack because they assume the user will be aware of the problem. I think he'd be happy with the WSE and Indigo implementations that implicitly protect against this attack by including the recipient information in signatures automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] more correctly, the message is protected with a message authentication code (MAC), which you can learn more about &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.GuideBook/WhatIsCIA.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>97</thr:total></entry><entry><id>14282</id><published>2005-08-21T15:19:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-08-21T15:19:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Thoughts on repudiation and surreptitious forwarding</title><content type="html">Now who could be gettings set up for embarrassment by receiving forwarded e-mail that says "I love you"?

I won't name the restaurant, but what's interesting is that when Bill checked his receipt against the actual charge on his online bank statement, he found that the restaurant added 20% above what they charged us on the check (which included a 17% mandatory tip already).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual charge was exactly 20% above the *total* price of the check, including gratuity and tax. I wonder how often they get away with that little scam, because if this had happened to me, I'd never have noticed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't usually check the actual charges that come in against the receipts I bring home.

These are the same topics I hosted at TechEd, and they were a blast. Some great discussions came out of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing Secure Code&lt;/strong&gt;, Tuesday 9:00pm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bring your questions as well as your experiences to this interactive discussion. Participants share what techniques they are using to ensure bulletproof implementations, including third party tools. Also on the agenda are the top threats that developers need to worry about when writing code. Remember, it's not just the guys calling security APIs that need to worry about this! Anyone writing code to access valuable assets should care about this topic, so let's have a big turnout!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing Partially Trusted Code&lt;/strong&gt;, Tuesday 10:15pm (BYOC)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Writing partially trusted code can be tricky. But a lot of people feel that it's an important tool in our security arsenal: by running with only the permissions we need, the CLR puts walls around our apps to help ensure we can't be tricked into doing something we didn't intend to do. Come discuss the pros and cons of running under partial trust. There are a lot of gotchas, so if you've had experiences, we'd love to hear about them. And if you're just considering taking on the challenge of writing partially trusted code, you'll get a great head start by joining us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I was hit by the same thing - it was getting frustrating not being able to use machine names after getting home from PDC. Simple name resolution was simply not working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone else is having this problem, run ipconfig /all and check your Node Type. Mine was flipped to something like “Peer to Peer“. The following registry entry (followed by a reboot - bleh) switched it to Broadcast and made things work again. I've not spent much time studying the name resolution protocol that MS uses, but I know I don't have a WINS server at home, so I guess Broadcast makes the most sense for me (if you know better, please post a comment here :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the registry key you need to tweak, assuming you're running XP:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netbt\Parameters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a DWORD named value called NodeType and set it's value to 1. Reboot and check your node type again - it should be Broadcast, and name resolution should start working again for you.&lt;/p&gt;

type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dan Jones from Microsoft gives the story on the third page of &lt;a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/msdn/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=17320"&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the June CTP, SQL Server started using local groups to abstract the actual account you use to run SQL Server from the permissions granted. Remember how hard it was to change the user SQL Server ran as under SQL 2000? Well, with the groups, it becomes much easier. All ACLs, privileges, etc. are granted to the groups instead of to the individual user (standard best practices). That's the good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad news is that they haven't yet dealt with the case SQL Server is installed on a domain controller (Small Business Server is a great example of this). There are no local groups there, so they end up creating domain local groups. No big deal there, except that they then try to add NETWORK SERVICE into those groups, and on a domain controller you cannot add built-in identities or groups into domain groups (which in hindsight is probably a good idea even on non-DC machines - you shouldn't be changing the permission level of any built-in identities or groups that the OS depends on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wouldn't be a problem if the installer let you configure the identities for ALL the daemons that Yukon sets up. For example, I'm configuring the services to run as a domain account called SqlUser. That account clearly wouldn't have a problem being added to a group. But apparently there is some Active Directory helper daemon that they have hardcoded to run as NETWORK SERVICE, and that is where they run into trouble. And there may be others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read &lt;a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/msdn/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=17320"&gt;Dan's post&lt;/a&gt;, you'll see that they plan on fixing this problem by RTM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm posting this in the hopes of saving somebody a lot of hassle - Google shows an awful lot of threads that end with the unanswered question. The solution for now (if you can call it that) is to install Yukon not on the DC, but on a member server in the domain. That's not too bad if you're working with Virtual PC and have an extra stick of RAM laying around ;-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>14964</id><published>2005-09-21T14:51:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-09-21T14:51:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Detailed list of .NET version numbers</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder what v2.0.50215 means in English?

&lt;p&gt;The picture clearly shows how repetitions in plaintext become apparent when you look at the overall message encrypted under ECB. Very neat! This should also make it clear how helpful it is to compress plaintext before encrypting it, in order to reduce redundancy. SSL does this, for example.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>15083</id><published>2005-09-29T06:41:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-09-29T06:41:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Cipher modes and plaintext redundancy</title><content type="html">I thought it was cool that you linked to Wikipedia!</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="15078"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>15085</id><published>2005-09-29T07:34:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-09-29T07:34:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Welcome Dan Sullivan!</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dan/"&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt; is the latest blogger to join the Pluralsight &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/default.aspx"&gt;community&lt;/a&gt;.

I've been asked to add content about it in my own presentations at TechEd and PDC. But many people get confused about how SDL applies to them. Consider for example, this excerpt from the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/security/sdl"&gt;SDL document&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;tt&gt;During the requirements phase, the product team makes contact with the central security team to request the assignment of a security advisor (referred to as the "security buddy" in the implementation of the SDL at Microsoft) who serves as point of contact, resource, and guide as planning proceeds.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small- to medium-sized companies look at this and wonder, “Are we supposed to have a central security team?” Then later in the document they read,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;tt&gt;During the release phase, the software should be subject to a Final Security Review ("FSR"). The goal of the FSR is to answer one question. "From a security viewpoint, is this software ready to deliver to customers?" The FSR is conducted two to six months prior to software completion, depending on the scope of the software. The software must be in a stable state before the FSR, with only minimal non-security changes expected prior to release.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two to six months? After a bit of this, it's easy to get the impression that SDL (at least as presented in this document) may work well for Microsoft, but isn't appropriate for a typical ISV or smaller enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I spent some time in Redmond, reviewing some of the new security content coming out of the Patterns &amp;amp; Practices group. During the three days I was up there, I spent about a third of that time chatting with J.D. Meier about his strategies and goals for publishing security advice for the rest of us, many of whom don't happen to have security buddies in their companies, or two months to wait before shipping a product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security engineering process that P&amp;amp;P recommends is designed to be tailored to &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; needs. It doesn't assume that you have a central security team or a huge security budget. It's all about prioritizing your work so that you can make use of the limited money and cycles that you have to do the best possible job of securing your applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this whets your appetite, let me help you get started finding your way around the oodles of content that's available to you today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by surfing to &lt;a href="http://msdn.com/securityguidance"&gt;http://msdn.com/securityguidance&lt;/a&gt; and focus on the table of contents in the tree view. As I write this, here's what you'll see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security Engineering 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Guidelines 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How Tos 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Checklists 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practices 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Views&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security Engineering&lt;/strong&gt; is all about process. This is where you'll find advice for building security into your own software development lifecycle, no matter if you use a waterfall, agile, or other approach to developing software. Here you'll learn how to overlay security tasks onto existing processes: requirements, design, implementation, testing, etc. so that no matter where you do these things in your current lifecycle, you'll know what sort of security tasks need to be done in that phase. You'll also find specific guidance on performing each of these tasks, from &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/SecurityGuidanceIndex.asp"&gt;Security Architecture &amp;amp; Design Reviews&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/SecurityGuidanceIndex.asp"&gt;Threat Modeling&lt;/a&gt;, to advice on performing your own &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/SecurityCodeReviewIndex.asp"&gt;Security Code Reviews&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guidelines&lt;/strong&gt; give specific advice on secure design and implementation issues, including input validation, secret encryption, authentication, and more. The guidelines focus more on the WHY than the HOW. I'm the kind of person who would prefer that you teach me to fish as opposed to handing me a couple salmon because I look hungry. The goal of the guidelines is to teach you to fish, if that analogy makes sense :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Howtos&lt;/strong&gt; on the other hand simply focus on HOW to get the job done in a step by step manner. Each of the guidelines should have an associated howto, and I'm hoping in the future there will be more back-and-forth linkage between the two; this was one of the many suggestions I gave during my three day visit. Howtos are great for those of us who already understand the issues and just need a reminder of how to implement a security feature. And for someone who doesn't understand the issues and doesn't have time for the WHY, a howto just might close a vulnerability they otherwise might have left open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checklists&lt;/strong&gt; are a quick way to make sure you've not forgotten anything. If you run through a checklist and find you've missed something, you should whip open the guidelines and read about the issue, then follow any howto links for a step-by-step guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practices&lt;/strong&gt; are something that sit in between guidelines and howtos, and are useful for people who don't need the detailed step-by-step instructions found in the howtos. If you're already an expert ASP.NET programmer, you might want to read the Guidelines and then use the Practices document as your guide to implementing security features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Views&lt;/strong&gt; show you indexes that are filtered based on a few simple criteria. If you're doing ASP.NET 2.0, you probably don't want to see 1.x advice. I'd recommend drilling down into the views just to see if they can help you get to the content you need more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now the preponderance of advice is in the ASP.NET space, which isn't surprising since that's J.D.'s background ;-) But it's a good start, because web applications are often the most risky applications because they are typically available to remote, anonymous attackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P&amp;amp;P is actively working to provide advice for other types of appliations as well, but look, don't be put off if today's advice isn't targeted at the particular type of application you're building today. A lot of the advice given in the guidelines for ASP.NET applications is generally applicable to other types of applications as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to get the very latest &amp;amp; greatest info that's coming out of P&amp;amp;P with respect to security, check out the wiki that J.D. maintains on channel9. This is where his team floats new ideas and new views of content. It's easy to find at &lt;a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/security"&gt;http://channel9.msdn.com/security&lt;/a&gt;. And since it's a wiki, you can leave feedback about what you'd like to see from these guys in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>15191</id><published>2005-10-01T18:04:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-10-01T18:04:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">SDL and security for smaller shops</title><content type="html">Keith Brown: Security engineering for the rest of us...</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="15185"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>15250</id><published>2005-10-03T10:00:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-10-03T10:00:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Security engineering for the rest of us</title><content type="html">I added you to wikipedia.org

I hacked up a little app to help him find if he's got any duplicate SPNs registered; you might also find this useful.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Here's what an entry in the listing will normally look like. The SPN is listed first, followed by the user account onto which it maps. I sort the output by SPN to make it a bit more readable:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;PayrollSystem/MAIN --&amp;gt; CN=BtsUser,CN=Users,DC=nwm,DC=local&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;When you have a duplicate SPN, I'll call it out. This example shows the PayrollSystem/MAIN SPN has been mapped onto two different domain accounts, which means anyone who tries to authenticate with it using Kerb will fail.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;PayrollSystem/MAIN --&amp;gt; CN=BtsUser,CN=Users,DC=nwm,DC=local&lt;br /&gt;PayrollSystem/MAIN --DUPLICATE--&amp;gt;  CN=Alice Wu,CN=Employees,DC=nwm,DC=local&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;To fix this, you'd run the following command to remove the erroneous SPN mapping to Alice:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;setspn -D PayrollSystem/MAIN NWM\Alice&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'm having trouble posting the code directly to the blog, but you can get it &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/samples/DumpSPN.zip"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>45929</id><published>2007-01-30T10:26:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-30T10:26:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Detecting duplicate SPNs</title><content type="html">How do you get this app to run?</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="15503"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>15570</id><published>2005-10-14T10:41:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-10-14T10:41:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">W2K3 SP1 IIS6 Service Unavailable NOT fixed with latest patch</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just got hit with this today, and a bit of googling shows that lots of folks have been running into problems with IIS6 application pools after installing SP1. My lab box is a W2K3 domain controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I've been running SP1 for awhile in the lab, my app pools were running as Network Service and everything was swell. But when I switched to a custom user account, I started seeing some incredibly odd behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, the user account has all the right privileges - it's a member of IIS_WPG, for example. And running FILEMON shows no problems accessing files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the AppPool first starts up, keeping a close watch on TaskManager, I can see W3WP.EXE start up, but the user name says &lt;UNKNOWN&gt;which is really odd. And get this - if the user account was recently created, looking at Active Directory shows that the account has *never*  been logged in. IOW, W3WP.EXE is being launched, then its dentity is being changed to the custom identity (maybe that's how IIS works, but it sure feels odd).&lt;/UNKNOWN&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the security event log (I log both success and failed logon events) shows nothing. It doesn't appear as though any attempt is being made to log in the custom user (and later scouring the user account with ADSIEDIT shows that it's never been logged on). The SYSTEM event log shows about five attempts to start the application pool, then the pool is disabled (I'm sure you've seen this before). This is the typical thing you see when you get the dreaded “Service Unavailable“ error. &lt;em&gt;Tip for those new to this - you need to manually restart the application pool once you get this error - refresh the Application Pools folder in IIS manager and you'll see which pools are disabled -  you need to right-click the disabled pool and choose “start“ to reenable it, otherwise you'll continue to get “Service Unavailable“ even if you've fixed the underlying problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user accounts I'm using are initially created using System.DirectoryServices. I will post the steps I'm taking to create these accounts at the end of this entry. Get this - if I use the AD Users &amp;amp; Groups snapin to create the user instead of my own code, the IIS application pool runs just fine. I can also call net user /add to add the user (and then add it to the IIS_WPG group), and that also works just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I compared the programmatically-created user account with the snapin-created account using ADSIEDIT, and only found one very small difference - an esoteric hidden flag on the account (ADS_UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD) was set on the account I created in code, but not in the snapin-created account. So I tweaked my code to turn off this switch, created a new account, and I'm still having the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I'm writing this blog entry, I'm also installing the October security patches for W2K3 (there are oh, about 8 of them). I'm hoping that one of these patches will fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: After letting the bits in my VPC cool a bit after installing the patches, sure enough, the problem reappeared. And now it's not just with my programmatically created user accounts - it's happening even with user accounts I create via AD Users &amp;amp; Groups. Looks like it's back to the googleboard for me :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strike&gt;AND SURE ENOUGH... after installing the latest security patches (just came out this week on MS Update), the problem appears to be fixed.&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Well, I hope this helps somebody - writing this post gave me something to do while the new patches installed, I guess. I'll update this post if I find that I'm just hallucinating, but it does indeed look as though the problem is fixed now.&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>15819</id><published>2005-10-23T18:34:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-10-23T18:34:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: W2K3 SP1 IIS6 Service Unavailable NOT fixed with latest patch</title><content type="html">We are having the same issues, but only with computers with windows XP SP2 and IE6 SP2, I found the following KB article on at Microsoft and appling this sorted out our issues.

type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/aaron" title="Aaron Skonnard, MSDN columnist: XML Files"&gt;Aaron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/aaron/archive/2005/10/14/15571.aspx"&gt;forgot to mention&lt;/a&gt; one rather important issue that he probably didn't notice because he runs as admin :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that HttpListener only works out of the box if you're running with high privilege (e.g., as a member of the BUILTIN\Administrators group). This is because security wonks don't want just anybody doing this magical port sharing thing (imagine the malware that would love to hide on port 80 on an XP SP2 box!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if the process that tries to use HttpListener is running under a least privilege user account (LUA) (in other words, if it's running as a normal user), it's not going to be allowed to listen unless a namespace reservation has been made by an administrator beforehand that grants the user permission to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A namespace reservation is simply a record that sets an access control list (ACL) for an HTTP prefix (e.g. the URL you'd normally pass to HttpListener.Prefixes.Add). This allows the administrator to say which users are allowed to register that prefix with HTTP.SYS. If you have a daemon that's doing this, you can simply register the SID for the user account of that daemon as being authorized to register the prefix. An easy way to do this is to run HTTPCFG.EXE (note that this must be done on each machine where HttpListener is to be used):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;httpcfg set urlacl -u http://*:80/foo -a D:(A;;GX;;;S-1-5-20)&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The odd looking code at the end is security descriptor description language (SDDL) that represents an ACL with a single entry, granting the SID S-1-5-20 the generic execute permission, which is the rather arbitrary access permission that HTTP.SYS looks for in order to grant permission to listen. Just replace the SID with the one you're using (later on I link to an example with some code that simplifies forming this SDDL - you only need to know the account name, not the SID to use it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it's not just one identity that needs to be allowed to use the HTTP.SYS transport (maybe a smart client is using it), then you should grant the namespace reservation to a group and add whatever users you want to be allowed to use it into that group. If all users on the machine should be allowed, you can grant the permission to the BUILTIN\Users group (S-1-5-32-545).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have an installer for your application that uses HttpListener, you should have your installer add the namespace reservation, because installers normally run with enough privilege to do this. If you are deploying to a wide audience, you will likely not know which user account or group should be granted this right, so you'll need to ask the administrator as part of your setup. Your installer will then need to call the Win32 function, HttpSetServiceConfigurationAcl (which is all that httpcfg does when you use the &lt;em&gt;set urlacl &lt;/em&gt;command with it). I just posted some &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/archive/2005/10/17/15632.aspx"&gt;sample .NET code&lt;/a&gt; to show how this can be done programmatically in C#.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>15636</id><published>2005-10-17T11:33:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-10-17T11:33:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Link Listing - October 17, 2005</title><content type="html">Aaron's HTTP.SYS transport running as LUA [Via: Keith Brown ]

&lt;p&gt;I'm working on some deployment scripts, and part of what they do is create user and group accounts in Active Directory and SQL Server logins for some of those users and groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself at a place where I had a login for a group Foo, and I was logged in as a user with that group (I checked with W2K3's convenient &lt;strong&gt;whoami /groups&lt;/strong&gt; to make sure). But for some reason I could not log in to the database. I then created a new login manually for another group, and sure enough that worked fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seemed to be some difference between what my script was doing (create login Foo for windows) and what SQL Management Studio was doing, but here's what was really happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you create a SQL login for a user or a group, the *name* is not used to resolve the login. Rather the SID for the account is used. It turns out that while my AD code was always deleteing and recreating users at each deploy, my database script had code like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;if not exists(select * from master.sys.syslogins where name='Foo')
begin
  create login [Foo] for windows
end&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, I wasn't creating the login if it already existed. So after running the deploy two times, the system was broken - the login didn't get recreated so it was using the old SID (when you delete a user or group account and then add it again, even if you use the same name, it gets a unique SID).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see this breaking in other scenarios as well. Just keep in mind that if you delete a user or group and readd it, you need to do the same thing to your SQL logins so they can get the new SID!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>15715</id><published>2005-10-19T17:34:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-10-19T17:34:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: SQL Server logins and SIDs</title><content type="html">Would sp_change_users_login work in this case to match the SIDs back up?</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="15667"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>15716</id><published>2005-10-19T17:58:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-10-19T17:58:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: SQL Server logins and SIDs</title><content type="html">Good question.

public string GetNetFrameworkDirectory() {
    StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder(

And I want to be able to use xpath expressions to index into them, but xpath is more painful (for what I'm doing at least) when namespaces are involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes config files look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they often also look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;configuration xmlns='...'&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed a way to strip out the namespace before doing my queries. I found a solution and thought I'd share it here. XmlElement.SetAttribute can be used to change the namespace declaration (this is some special case code in the .NET DOM for this). But the change doesn't seem to take effect right away - I had to serialize the DOM tree and reload it, then things worked nicely. Here's a little function to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;XmlDocument stripDocumentNamespace(XmlDocument oldDom) {
    // some config files have a default namespace
    // we are going to get rid of that to simplify our xpath expressions
    if (oldDom.DocumentElement.NamespaceURI.Length &amp;gt; 0) {
        oldDom.DocumentElement.SetAttribute("xmlns", "");
        // must serialize and reload the DOM
        // before this will actually take effect
        XmlDocument newDom = new XmlDocument();
        newDom.LoadXml(oldDom.OuterXml);
        return newDom;
    }
    else return oldDom;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I should probably have made it more clear that stripping namespaces is not to be taken lightly. I posted this to show not only how to strip namespaces, but how to *change* namespaces if necessary. Be careful that you know what you're doing if you strip. Here was my response to Dan:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This is a case where it's all the same namespace, which is why I pointed out that namespaces don't really matter in my case. I definitely thought about your concern, but from a purely practical perspective, the only reason the namespace is used in &amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt; is to get intellisense. So it seems pretty clear to me that stripping is very much appropriate in this case.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'd never do this with a SOAP message, for example, where namespaces are used quite regularly, and are important for the meaning of the message.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="15714"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>15764</id><published>2005-10-20T22:58:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-10-20T22:58:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: How to strip (or change) an XML namespace with XmlDocument</title><content type="html">Hi,

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I actually went down that path first. But with xpath there is no way to define a default namespace for use inside expressions. So I'd have had to define a prefix for Microsoft's default config namespace, then used that in each location step of each xpath expression. Oh, and then I have to get everyone else I'm working with to agree on the namespace prefix we're all going to use in the xpath expressions. Ick!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Another option (Dan suggested this) would be to explicitly use local-name() in my xpath expressions. Both of these options clutter up the xpath expressions, which in this *particular* application would reduce the readability of what I'm doing enough that I figured it simply wasn't worth it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Given MS's penchant for backwards compatibility, and given that it was only recently that we've seen namespaces in config files, I'm not worried that my code is going to break for the lifetime of this app.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;It was a purely practical decision that really simplifies things.

I am generating an xhtml document but I'm not able to set the proper namespace declaration in the generation process.  The document ends up with:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;xmlns:xf="http://www.example.org"
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And to get the document to work properly i need to change the declaration to:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;xmlns:xf="http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms"
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Could I put your script in the head of the document to automatically change the namespace when the document loads?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Also, are old.Dom and new.Dom to be taken literally or should they be replaced by something?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Any tips would be greatly appreciated!!

Finally, uh, the purists out there simple doesn't seem to realise that there are cases when you can get away with quick 'n' dirty. Time is money.

In my case it was a 3rd party app which rendered XML files with an invalid XMLNS reference (404). Simple solution was to ignore it, works like a charm.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="15714"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>15929</id><published>2005-10-27T20:12:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-10-27T20:12:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">HttpCfg GUI</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Looks like &lt;a href="http://www.stevestechspot.com/"&gt;Steve Johnson&lt;/a&gt; has a blog now, and his second post includes &lt;a href="http://www.stevestechspot.com/default.aspx?articleId=c1f96ead0baf4d93b9695869bc8147dc"&gt;a nifty GUI&lt;/a&gt; that wraps the functionality of httpcfg.exe (which isn't the friendliest tool).

Not having much luck so far. VPC can't mount the ISO image directly, so I burned it to a DVD+RW and tried installing, which gave me an error while installing the .NET Framework 2.0 (I couldn't repro it because after running it a second time the install got past that step smoothly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway,I wanted to make sure that the image I downloaded matched the ISO that was up on the MSDN site, so I hacked up a little SHA1 hash calculator. I tried using both the managed and unmanaged SHA1 implementations and found (not surprisingly) that the unmanaged version was considerably faster, so I stuck with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here's the code for the SHA1 calculator if you want one of these for yourself. Post comments if you have improvements, especially perf improvements!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;using System;

    const int PROGESS_INTERVAL_MS = 1000;
     static void Main(string[] args) {
        if (0 == args.Length) {
            Console.Error.WriteLine("Usage: sha1 fname [fname ...]");
        }
        foreach (string fname in args) {
            processFile(fname);

&lt;p&gt;I remember Douglas Adams's keynote at the 1996 PDC, where he talked about how computers do certain things well, but humans are much better at many tasks. He emphasized that human-computer interfaces should take advantage of this, describing a tool that was used to figure out the cheapest path for a road through a mountainous area that was ultimately calculated by a human and a force-feedback joystick. The pressures in the joystick represented costs and other tensions for building the road in a certain area, and the human guided the joystick according to those pressures, quickly finding the optimal route for the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've probably decimated the story, but damn it was a great keynote, and I was really happy to have been able to see Doug in person, being such a big fan of his work. Anyway, this new service from amazon.com allows companies to parse out work (looks like a lot of pattern-recognition work at first glance) that computers simply don't do well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there's a web service interface if you want to wire your apps into it.

Claim is a term which you've heard a lot about if you've paid much attention to the WS-* security specs, and I think you'll be hearing a lot more about it in the future with InfoCard coming down the road:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interests of completeness, now that we have defined "digital subject", let's define "claim".  At the same time I will explain why I have used the word "claim" where others might have said "security assertion" or just "assertion".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, according to the OED, an assertion is a "confident and forceful statement of fact or belief".  On the other hand, a claim is "an assertion of the truth of something, typically one which is disputed or in doubt".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting that systems deriving from the X.500 and X.509 standards - including LDAP - have employed the word "attribute value assertion" (abbreviated AVA) to describe the mechanism by which the attributes of an object are presented.  Those systems were thought out from the vantage point of the "administrative domain" making the assertions;  Active Directory's LDAP engine was built along this model.  So indeed, information is stored in the directory, which later "confidently and forcefully" presents it to the digital subjects of the domain, either through queries or associated protocols like kerberos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When all subjects subscribe to the same administrative authority, and the trust boundaries are extremely clear and well defined, it makes sense to employ a metaphor based on confidence and force.  But in evolving from a closed domain model to an open, federated model, the situation is transformed into one where the party making an assertion and the party evaluating it may have a complex and even ambivalent relationship.  In this context, assertions need always be subject to doubt - not only doubt that they have been transmitted from the sender to the recipient intact, but also doubt that they are actually true.  We need to incorporate the insights of SPKI.  We must always favor the vantage point of the relying party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word "claim" - taken as "an assertion of the truth of something which is ...  in doubt" - grasps the subtleties of the federated world by adding the right dose of doubt to any assertion being made, and effectively reminding us to surface this doubt in our implementaiton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>16778</id><published>2005-11-14T22:00:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-11-14T22:00:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Trust is such a loaded word</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;"The data server trusts the application server."&lt;br /&gt;"Domain B trusts domain A."&lt;br /&gt;"Bob validates the ticket and develops trust in the client."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does any of that mean? I've seen way too many instances where the word trust really just muddies the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, does the first statement imply that the data server trusts the validity of the input it's getting from the app server? Or does it imply that client authorization occurs in the app server and that we have a "trusted subsystem" (the word crops up again and again, doesn't it?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domain trust in Windows is often misunderstood. The second statement is typically shorthand for saying that domain A has a Kerberos trust relationship established with domain B such that domain A is allowed to issue a TGT for domain B to a user that domain B does not have the ability to authenticate. But often people read more into it than that, assuming that there's more going on, perhaps granting special privileges or access permissions. Trust is a confusing term, especially when left unqualified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third statement, what exactly does Bob trust about his client? Maybe Bob has received a signed statement (such as a Kerb ticket) from his security authority that helps prove that the sender is indeed the legitimate bearer of the credentials she's using. But does that mean Bob should trust her actions? Just because someone is authenticated doesn't mean they won't act maliciously. But the statement doesn't really convey that, does it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always tried to be very specific about my use of the word trust. For example, in the third statement, I would typically say, "Bob validates the ticket and develops trust in the identity of the client." But perhaps I shouldn't even use the word at all. Maybe, "Bob learns the client's identity" would be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is there any reason to develop a login form for my vb.net windows application (to be run by a dozen or so users, all XP, with SQL 2005 backend) such that the login form prompts again for userid and password?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advantage of at least prompting for userid again is to add a little bit more security to the login process - I suppose it may hinder an "evil doer" from walking by someone's computer and launching my application.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It also seems to be overkill - if the user's logon already verified credentials, I ought not do that again it seems.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Comments?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;It's good that you are thinking of these sorts of things. Some highly secure enterprise applications do require the user to reauthenticate, on a regular basis.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;But I understand your feeling of discomfort at doing this. There are some significant downsides to doing this sort of thing.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;For one thing, you are training the user to type in her password whenever she is prompted by an application. I'd rather see the user only enter the password when prompted by WinLogon, which runs on a secure desktop and is harder to spoof.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;Also, you must collect the user's password in your memory space. This makes your app a target for attackers. You're painting a bullseye on your back. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;There's a really good reason why Windows requires you to press Control-Alt-Delete to login. This is a "secure attention sequence" that only very privileged code can respond to. This "gets the attention" of the real operating system, which then switches to a secure desktop (the WinLogon desktop) and asks the user for her password.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;Note that WinLogon prompts the user for her password *after* she's initiated the SAS. WinLogon doesn't pop up password dialogs at random times - this was very carefully designed by the folks who built the core OS, and was designed to train the user that it's only safe to type her password after she performs the SAS and sees the WinLogon desktop.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;Of course, other groups in Microsoft and other application vendors have subverted this (in the name of convenience) over time. But the idea remains valid.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;In wild-west environments where the users are all admins of their own machines, this breaks down, because any malware that the user runs will also run as admin, allowing it to replace parts of the OS if it wants (including WinLogon). So this mechanism only really provides guarantees in well-managed secure environments. But I'm sure you don't want your app to be the weak link in such an environment!&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoPlainText"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;There is a very simple way to force the user to reauthenticate. Call LockWorkstation. That locks the user's workstation and forces them to go through WinLogon to reauthenticate and get back in. Of course if you do this every time the user launches your app, people aren't going to like your app very much. And you're making your own security policy, which is not a good idea. Much better is to let the security officers at the site make these sorts of decisions, and they can already do that without your application's help - Group Policy can be used to configure screen saver options, including password protection and idle time, locking the user's workstation for them if they walk away for a certain period of time (http://tinyurl.com/53txz).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>16961</id><published>2005-11-20T09:31:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-11-20T09:31:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">InfoCard terminology</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I delve deeper into InfoCard, I'm concerned that we're not loose with terminology. In order for the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/webservices/understanding/advancedwebservices/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnwebsrv/html/identitymetasystem.asp"&gt;Identity Metasystem&lt;/a&gt; to succeed, we need to make sure that we don't confuse people into thinking it's &lt;a href="http://news.com.com/Longhorn+could+be+tough+sell+for+Microsoft+-+page+4/2100-1016_3-5645841-4.html?tag=st.next"&gt;just another Passport&lt;/a&gt;. That would be a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An InfoCard is an identity &lt;em&gt;selector&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, an “InfoCard” doesn't have any identity information in it, only some metadata that helps the secured identity selector GUI determine which identities would be accepted by a given relying party (RP), so the user can select from a subset of her identities that will work with the RP. This metadata includes things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Token type (e.g. this identity is represented by a SAML token) 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Claims supported (given name, email, age, etc.) 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Address of identity provider &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual values for these claims (name, email, age, etc.) aren't stored with the InfoCard itself. The identity provider (IP) holds this data, which is why under the covers, InfoCard makes a round-trip to the IP in order to get the token that is ultimately sent to the RP. The token is the credential. The InfoCard is just a way for you to select which token you want to send. It prevents an end user from ever having to see the word “token“, which is a good thing. But the InfoCard itself is never transmitted to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet if you read the documentation surrounding InfoCard today, you'll find that the wording gets a bit loose in places. Here's an excerpt from the Samples_Walkthrough.doc file in the &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=66734401-4988-4ded-9876-3dc10223052c&amp;amp;displaylang=en"&gt;Federated Identity and Access Resource Kit&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis is mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in 3pt 0.75in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .75in" class="Text"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-list: Ignore"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;·&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Verdana"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Resource STS&lt;/b&gt; – The Web service from the basic sample is modifed to require a security token issued by a Security Token Service (STS). The STS requires requestors to &lt;em&gt;authenticate using a self-issued “InfoCard”&lt;/em&gt; and issues a security token that contains an email address claim retrieved from an account database.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in 3pt 0.75in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .75in" class="Text"&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-list: Ignore"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;·&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Verdana"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Identity Provider STS &lt;/b&gt;– The Web service from the basic sample requires a security token issued by an Identity Provider. The Identity Provider STS requires the requestor to authenticate using a username and password and &lt;em&gt;submit a managed “InfoCard,”&lt;/em&gt; and issues a security token that contains an email address claim retrieved from an account database.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, the above text also talks about security tokens (which is really what gets passed around between the user's system and the IP and RP). But saying we “submit an InfoCard” is misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another example. What impression do you get when you look at this config excerpt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;wsHttpBinding&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;binding configurationName="myBinding"&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;security mode="Message"&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;      &amp;lt;message clientCredentialType="InfoCard" /&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;/security&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;/binding&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/wsHttpBinding&amp;gt; &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, the “InfoCard” credential type is really just an alias for a self-issued SAML token that contains an email claim. But someone new to this technology could easily look at this and think that InfoCard itself is a credential. Besides being confusing, this can lead people into thinking that InfoCard is an identity system, when really it's just an abstraction to make the selection of identities easier for a user. It's the part of the identity &lt;em&gt;metasystem&lt;/em&gt; that is surfaced to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that going forward the guys working on InfoCard will be sensitive to this. I'm really excited about the potential for the &lt;a href="http://www.identityblog.com/2004/12/01.html#a44"&gt;identity big bang&lt;/a&gt;, and I don't want misconceptions to derail it!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>17020</id><published>2005-11-21T23:01:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-11-21T23:01:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">InfoCard Terminology</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="16961"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>17084</id><published>2005-11-24T20:04:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-11-24T20:04:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: InfoCard terminology</title><content type="html">OK.

&lt;br /&gt;If blogging software, and the developers who write their pieces took the time to include them. The popup acronym! Developer knowledge and understanding of the issue would take a monumental step forward if writterwere more concious of this simingly simple issue.

It works like a charm, and I've been very happy with it, but frankly I'm getting tired of Outlook and I want to start moving away from that beast. Outlook must do many really neat things that I don't need, because it takes a hell of a long time to load, and it often doesn't want to go away even when I want it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, my PST file is getting HUGE with all those feeds going into it. Frankly, once I read a news item, I don't need it stored on my hard drive after that. That's what Google search is for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I downloaded a trial of &lt;a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/"&gt;FeedDemon&lt;/a&gt; (FD) so that I could try something new. I like a lot of things about it - the way it allows me to organize feeds into groups and gives me a little newspaper view over each group. The view isn't all that sophisticated, and sometimes it looks kinda weird, but it works well enough. (FWIW, looks like FD is now owned by NewsGator).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FD has a tabbed browsing option - I guess they figured you'd use it for your web browser as well. But for web browsing, I'm used to FireFox. With all the plugins I've got that block ads, etc. my view of the Internet has changed significantly. I can customize it so that it suits my needs, and I like that. But FD uses the IE browser control. So when I click a link from someone's blog, I'm back to ad city. Maybe I'm getting old, but I just &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; read web content with flashing ads in the middle of it anymore. I'm too used to my custom view of the Internet, and I'm not willing to give it up so easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well anyway, my trial period for FD is about to expire, so I need to make a change. I sure wish there were a way to piece together a blog aggregator, allowing me to choose which browser I'd like to use, etc. Maybe someone reading this blog has some ideas - please share!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for the folks working on Outlook and similar products, guys, please consider revisiting the “less is more” school of thought. Give me something that I can piece together based on my needs, not some monolithic beast that wants to bend me to its will.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>15</thr:total></entry><entry><id>17170</id><published>2005-11-28T11:24:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-11-28T11:24:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Looking for a new blog aggregator</title><content type="html">hey keith,

I'm sure most people reading this have had a similar experience. It's a great example where blindly throwing countermeasures at a system can weaken it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;tt&gt;
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Our security people here distributed a group policy that Enables "Interactive logon: Do not display last user name". So, everytime you log into your machine, you have to provide your user name. Fine.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;When your workstation is locked either manually or automatically (through a screen saver), you're required to log in again to display your desktop. In the logon box, your user name is pre-entered for you. Throughout the day, you end up logging into your machine to unlock it. You do it so much in fact, that you get quite accustomed to simply entering only your password.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Now, let's say you lock your workstation and go home for the night. Let's also say that from home you VPN into work and Remote Desktop (RD) to your locked workstation. You complete your task and log out of your workstation.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;The next morning you get to work and give your workstation the 3-finger salute. Before the monitor has warmed up, you enter your password to unlock the workstation. You hit Enter, and hear a beep. Seems that your login was rejected. That's because your desktop wasn't really in "locked" mode. The RD session from the previous night changed the type of login that is required the next morning. The password that you just entered went into the user name text box of the login dialog. When you hit enter, you attempted to log into your workstation using your password as the user name and a blank password. Because this login failed it's logged in the Event Log. Guess what's in there? Yep, it's your password!&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;So in the interest of making your machine more secure, it is actually compromised. You might say that I'm a bonehead because I should have remembered that I used RD the previous night. I contend that the day-to-day operations actually condition one to expect the password-only login. It's also tough to remember over the course of a long weekend or vacation that you used RD. After all, it only takes one of these incidents to compromise your machine security. This is especially true when your normal user id runs as administrator. ;-) I'm not sure who deserves blame here. To some extent it's the security administrators, me, and also Microsoft...&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sad thing about this is that if James makes this "mistake", you just know that lots of other, less savvy users are doing the same thing. The way the system is configured pretty much forces this to happen from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Schneier constantly reminds us, security is all about tradeoffs. What do you gain by turning on the DontDisplayLastUserName feature? Given that it only takes effect when you're logged out, not when your workstation is simply locked, not much! There are an awful lot of people who &lt;strong&gt;rarely&lt;/strong&gt; log out of their machines (me included), and rather lock their workstations instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if everyone did log out regularly, how does it help? You're forcing an attacker to find some other way to discover user names. It certainly doesn't prevent remote exploits; you need to be standing in front of the console to take advantage of this "vulnerability" (this includes remote desktop - even without the DontDisplayLastUserName feature, remote desktop doesn't show the last user who was logged in at the console). And think to yourself, how easy would it be for someone to simply guess my user name anyway? If the attacker is standing in my office, she's got all the information she needs to figure out my user name. It may take a few guesses, but it's not a hard problem. In James's case, coupled with the strict screensaver policy, this makes his life significantly harder. If a countermeasure makes things harder (and more risky) for legitimate users, and doesn't provide any real impediment for an attacker, it's a &lt;strong&gt;bad tradeoff&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security features should be transparent or users will balk, or worse, make mistakes like these. I hope the administrators at James's company read this. If they happen to be reading, I'd suggest picking up a copy of &lt;a href="http://www.bookpool.com/sm/0321336437"&gt;Jesper &amp;amp; Steve's book&lt;/a&gt;, which provides really practical advice for securing Windows. It'll help prevent these sorts of mistakes in the future!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>17241</id><published>2005-12-01T10:15:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-12-01T10:15:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Yet another reason to run as non-admin</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="http://www.thechannelinsider.com/print_article2/0,1217,a=166172,00.asp"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://blogs.technet.com/jesper_johansson/archive/2005/11/30/415328.aspx"&gt;Jesper's blog&lt;/a&gt;. Not surprisingly, running as non-admin tends to prevent malware and other crap you don't want from installing itself on your machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;tt&gt;
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Using fully patched Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP Professional clients, we visited a series of less-than-savory Web sites in an effort to install various types of adware and spyware bundlers.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;We performed the same tests on separate but identical virtual machines, varying only the user's group membership—with users representing Administrators, Power Users and Users.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;After attempting to install the various applications, we rebooted the client, logged in with an approved Administrator account and installed anti-spyware software. &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Using this software, Sunbelt Software Inc.'s CounterSpy 1.5, we scanned each system, totaling the number of threats found as well as the grand total of threat instances detected.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;We found a vast degree of difference among the three user memberships. On our Windows 2000 Professional client with User permissions only, none of the malware installed completely and two threats actually warned that the user had insufficient privileges. &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>17259</id><published>2005-12-02T18:07:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-12-02T18:07:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">InfoCard API</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So far all the examples of InfoCard have been centered around WCF. But I was curious how one would access InfoCard directly and request a token from a non-WCF service requestor app. Sure enough, in Microsoft.InfoCards, there's a class called InfoCardClient that has a few interesting static methods (I'm using the latest November CTP):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;void Manage();
void Import(string filename);
GenericXmlSecurityToken GetToken(
   EndpointAddress endpoint,
   IEnumerable&lt;XMLELEMENT&gt; policyElements,
   XmlElement requiredRemoteTokenIssuer);
&lt;/XMLELEMENT&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manage() brings up the Digital Identities control panel applet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume that Import() takes an InfoCard XML document and imports it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GetToken is the interesting one. There's even some sample code &lt;a href="http://winfx.msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/M_Microsoft_InfoCards_InfoCardClient_GetToken_2_b19ef2f8.asp"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;that describes how to use it. The policy you submit is basically what the relying party needs (token shape and claims required). The third argument can be null if you don't care which issuer the token comes from. I'm pretty close to actually making this call work; I just need a live endpoint (which I'm trying to fire up now using WCF, but the ServiceHost&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; class appears to have disappeared and been replace with a non-generic ServiceHost that I'm having difficulty getting working).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyway, if you were wondering how to use InfoCard directly, now you know. This will be a useful API to experiment with to learn more about how InfoCard works under the covers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>17268</id><published>2005-12-04T05:26:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-12-04T05:26:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Settling on a new aggregator</title><content type="html">Thanks for everyone who suggested their favorite aggregators. I've tried a bunch, and &lt;a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/omea/reader/"&gt;Omea Reader&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite so far. It does a lot more than read blogs, but so far I'm not investlng any more in it other than using it as a reader. I like it's recursive folder structure and the fact that you can view a newspaper at any level. You can also tell it to auto-delete read posts after they get to a certain age (I'm trying 30 days for now). It seems very fast and stable (I've seen an exception dialog pop up when I surfed to a wiki edit page from a link, but the program recovered flawlessly). It doesn't allow you to integrate FireFox, but from what I've read, it's pretty much impossible to integrate FireFox into any product because there's no control based on the FireFox code base, only Mozilla. Oh well; maybe I'll take the time to write a "View Link in FireFox" browser helper object (BHO) one of these days.</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>17271</id><published>2005-12-04T06:29:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-12-04T06:29:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Settling on a new aggregator</title><content type="html">glad i could be of service :)</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="17268"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>17274</id><published>2005-12-04T12:29:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-12-04T12:29:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Settling on a new aggregator</title><content type="html">Keith: In Omea, look at Tools | Options | General.

Last weekend I studied the Programming Ruby and fell in love (it didn't hurt that Dave Thomas is the author - he's eminently readable). Perl and Smalltalk have always been a couple of my favorite languages, and Ruby feels a lot like Perl++ with Smalltalk extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to learn something is to use it, and I've been wanting to make a closer study of WS-Policy (which is used pretty extensively in InfoCard), so I looked around and not finding any existing implementation in Ruby, I wrote a Ruby model for representing policy over the weekend. So far, it parses a policy into its model (with REXML parsing the XML), and provides a function to normalize compact policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the vast majority of my time on the normalization procedure, which was an excellent exercise in learning Ruby. So it doesn't even serialize policy yet, but I'll get that added in the next round. Currently it uses a placeholder to represent the assertions; I've not yet decided the best way to carry around the details of each assertion. The next logical step would be to intersect policies to weed out alternatives whose policy vocabularies don't match. I'd also like to add a more friendly enumerator over a normalized policy that simply gives you the choices (a normalized policy consists of one ExactlyOne containing a set of All elements with all the possible variations of alternatives, flattened out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is all this going? If I have the time, I'd like to eventually flesh out enough of a WS-* library in Ruby that I can implement an InfoCard relying party. Pretty ambitious, but if anyone wants to help, I think it'd be a valuable service to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you're a Ruby expert, I'd love for you to look at my code and let me know if I'm following modern idioms in the implementation and especially in the design of the library. If this ends up being more than a weekend project, I'd like to eventually publish it for others to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the library &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/samples/wspolicy_2005_12_05.zip"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You'll need to put it somewhere on your RUBYLIB path, or tweak your path to run the test suite.&lt;/p&gt;

It'd sure be nice if it were optional (and turned off by default).

&lt;br /&gt;The Insert key I could do without, with one exception.  It seems I'm the only one who persuaded a version of Grub (no longer current though) to work properly with a Japanese keyboard.  Since BIOS translation of scan codes doesn't cover enough keys, I had to abuse the scan code for the Insert key.

It's a nice workaround, if the app you're using allows you to assign a macro to the Insert key, as Word does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried the same thing in VS 2005, but it doesn't recognize the Insert key in the “shortcut key“ edit box. I wonder if this is just a UI limitation? Running FILEMON while saving a key assignment in VS 2005 shows it writing to two files in the profile: Current.VSK and User.VSK, but the VSK files are binary (bummer, here I thought VS was moving all its config to XML).&lt;/p&gt;

You can just reassign INS to do nothing and some out-of-the-way key to be your INS. The syntax is cryptic and the UI tool seems to have disappeared from the Microsoft site. But a cryptic API has never stopped you before? :) Just a thought.

It's neat how this interface can enable all sorts of interesting scenarios like one-time credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's a parallel discussion we should be having.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;tt&gt;You may notice the Identity Selector appears on a desktop that I hope will look "grayed out".  This represents the fact that applications running on the normal desktop cannot "see" into (read "steal from") the identity selector: deep in the operating system the two desktops are segregated so the InfoCard surface is, compared to conventional programs, secure. &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key phrase here is &lt;em&gt;compared to conventional programs&lt;/em&gt;. As much as I love the idea of the identity metasystem, I can't help but have dark thoughts about the potential for abuse. Even Kim &lt;a href="http://www.identityblog.com/2005/08/15.html#a302"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that this system will be deployed with a bullseye painted on its back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;tt&gt;We knew that if we were successful, the Infocard system would be one of the most attacked systems in the history of computing.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more we automate access to identity data from a user's machine, the more we need to worry about the ease of which that machine can be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A segregated desktop is no match for an attacker who has root compromised your machine. And it's incredibly easy to root a user's machine today because you're virtually guaranteed that the victim will be running as an admin. So when you convince her to launch your malware, it'll also run as admin. It's not even a challenge at that point! That's how &lt;a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html"&gt;Sony managed to install a rootkit&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/Blog/"&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt;'s machine. Even in many corporate environments, users are allowed to run with high privilege because so much software &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith/HallOfShame.html"&gt;fails to run&lt;/a&gt; well under &lt;a href="http://www.helpwithwindows.com/WindowsVista/lua.html"&gt;LUA&lt;/a&gt;, and the IT department doesn't have the resources to deal with every app that breaks. Ironically, those who are most vulnerable often run with the highest privilege. My neighbor (the least tech-savvy guy on the planet) logs in as Administrator to browse the web and read his email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;tt&gt;The InfoCard representations are "metadata" pointing to the URL where an identity provider is located, the types of technologies it supports, what kind of authentication it employs, and the like.  So there is not really anything tangible or worth stealing in the InfoCard metadata itself.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is true, but a rooted machine ultimately won't be able to stop the attacker from dereferencing the InfoCard. The attacker calls GetToken to initiate the dereference, then uses SendKeys to drive the identity selector interface that pops. Even better: decrypt an InfoCard and use the metadata there to request a token from the identity provider via WS-Trust. Of course, decrypting and dereferencing an InfoCard might require credentials like passwords. But remember, we're talking about a rooted machine here. The clever attacker will already know the user's passwords, via the keystroke logger she installed when the machine was originally compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear - I don't expect the InfoCard guys to build something that's robust enough to work as designed on a rooted system. All the attacks I've postulated against InfoCard work equally well on most other “secure“ credential management systems, even &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/04/07/SecurityBriefs/"&gt;the one I wrote for my own personal use&lt;/a&gt;. But what I do want to see is &lt;em&gt;real motion&lt;/em&gt; toward comprehensive security measures that prevent the user's machine from being rooted in the first place. XP SP2 was a good first step, but it's not nearly enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;a href="http://blogs.technet.com/jesper_johansson/archive/2005/11/30/415328.aspx"&gt;most effective countermeasures&lt;/a&gt; against malware is to run with least privilege. The &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/winlogo/"&gt;Windows Logo program&lt;/a&gt; was the first effort by Microsoft to get devs to &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.GuideBook/HowToDevelopCodeAsANonAdmin.html"&gt;start writing code&lt;/a&gt; that runs well with &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.GuideBook/WhatIsANonPrivilegedUser.html"&gt;least privilege&lt;/a&gt;. But as of yet, Microsoft hasn't taken the next step and actually encouraged users to run as non-admins. Even today, when you create a user account on WinXP, it's an admin account by default. Who would ever choose the “Limited User“ option? It sounds so, well, &lt;em&gt;limited&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is working to address this in Vista. They even use terminology that sounds appealing: &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/windowsvista/evaluate/feat/uaprot.mspx"&gt;user protection&lt;/a&gt;! But will Microsoft have the courage to turn this feature on by default when Vista ships? Will they persuade users to create least privilege accounts in the first place?

I'm wondering if swinging the pendulum in the other direction (going from "this machine isn't secure by default" to "you can't do everything you might need to on this machine") might have some lashback.

&lt;br /&gt;However, I'd rather have a machine that warns me when I might be doing something that could cause a virus than to leave me alone and let someone else take over my machine.

Here are the abstracts for my talks, in case you're interested. Be sure to come up and say hi if you're at the event!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside ASP.NET 2.0 Security Features&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="less-em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2006/sf/speakers.aspx#brown"&gt;Keith Brown&lt;/a&gt;, Pluralsight &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this talk, we'll drill down into a host of new features in ASP.NET 2.0 that make building secure web applications much easier than in the past. Some examples of what we'll cover include the new HttpOnly feature for cookies, web.config file encryption in single-server and web farm configurations, and the Role provider model for role-based security. By understanding how these features work and the problems they were designed to solve, you'll be much better prepared to use them effectively to secure your own applications!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack and Defense: Securing ASP.NET 2.0 Applications&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="less-em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2006/sf/speakers.aspx#brown"&gt;Keith Brown&lt;/a&gt;, Pluralsight &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Building secure ASP.NET applications involves much more than calling security APIs. It takes careful design that considers threats and applies countermeasures that solve real problems instead of just making the application harder to use. It takes a development team that knows how to write bulletproof code, with the foresight and funding to review that code and eradicate security flaws before they can be exploited. Ultimately, it takes education and a good process. This talk will introduce you to many resources you may not have been previously aware of: guidelines for threat modeling ASP.NET applications, howtos for eliminating common security vulnerabilities, and many others. You’ll find that even a small shop can afford to build security into the software development lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>17496</id><published>2005-12-15T15:59:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-12-15T15:59:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">The .NET Developer's Guide to Directory Services Programming</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I remember awhile back wishing I had a good book on directory services programming from .NET (System.DirectoryServices, etc.). On a whim, I pinged ADSI wunderkind Joe Kaplan about it, and it turned out he and some other folks had already been tossing the idea around. Joe recruited Ryan Dunn and together they have done it - they are in the final phases of delivery of their new book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321350170"&gt;The .NET Developer's Guide to Directory Service Programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which I'm excited to say is part of the top-notch .NET Development series. You can &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321350170"&gt;preorder&lt;/a&gt; your copy today - and after you read it, if you like it, please leave feedback on amazon.com. This pair worked really hard on this book, and deserve our gratitude for what at times I'm sure felt like a thankless job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan and Joe used a similar format for the book that I used in my security book, thus the similar title. If you ever do any work with System.DirectoryServices, this book is a &lt;em&gt;must have&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guys, I'm so happy for you!

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I hope you'll be pleased with the book.  I feel confident in saying that Ryan and I are pretty deep and have shipped a LOT of code that actually works.  We also are both MVPs and spend quite a bit of time in the trenches helping people make this stuff work every day, so I think we have a pretty good finger on what gives people trouble.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, our book is probably going to be at least 2x as long as the APress book (not totally sure about final page counts yet), so you can expect more details.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Addison Wesley will post a free chapter online once all the editing and layout is done (a few more months), so you'll be able to judge for yourself.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The book we had originally wanted to write would have been at least 2x as long as what we ended up with, so we had to pick out battles.  However, we do plan to follow it up with a really useful website.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;We are also exceedingly easy to get a hold of online (MS newsgroups or www.asp.net forums) in case you have questions.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="17496"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>17581</id><published>2005-12-20T14:16:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-12-20T14:16:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: The .NET Developer's Guide to Directory Services Programming</title><content type="html">Joe and Ryan, Can you provide the Online version of your book as Keith did for his guide book?</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="17496"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>18863</id><published>2006-02-17T03:03:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-02-17T03:03:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: The .NET Developer's Guide to Directory Services Programming</title><content type="html">Just pre-ordered mine on Amazon.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;From talking with our publisher, the book should be available any day at their website:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;http://www.awprofessional.com/title/0321350170
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;and within 1 week at Amazon, Bookpool, etc.  and within 2 weeks at brick and mortar stores.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I don't believe there is any exclusivity to the US, so Canada should be online at the same time - only minimal translation necessary ;)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Depending on what you are looking for, one of our more practical chapters is already available online as a sample here:

&lt;br /&gt;http://www.awprofessional.com/title/0321350170#info3

&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for you prompt response.  I need to know how to move a User from one Organizational Unit to another. Unfortunately, this chapter doesn't cover this.  Any suggestions, while I start hunting down your book?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I did try to reach the publisher by phone to try to get some quick answers, but was given an 800 number that cannot be reached from out here on the west coast.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Quickly, I will say this is very easy to do with the DirectoryEntry.MoveTo() method.  We cover this in Chapter 3, I believe.  Essentially, you just create a DirectoryEntry that represents the object to be moved and another one that represents the new container.  Pass the container to the MoveTo() method on the object to be moved and with proper permissions, it will be moved (you can rename at the same time as well).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you have further questions, I would suggest posting a message to either the ASP.NET LDAP and Active Directory forum (where I tend to hang out), or to the microsoft.public.adsi.general newsgroup where Joe tends to hang out.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This way we won't clog Keith's comments either.

type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm probably the last person in the world to figure this out, but ever since I've been using VS 2005, I've been rather bummed that snippets never seemed to work for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever type the letter 'c' while writing C# source code and see that tempting cw snippet sitting there? It's obvious what it's for - if you can get it to expand, it'll expand to Console.WriteLine(FOO) and highlight FOO allowing you to type whatever it was you wanted to dump to stdout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens when you select the snippet you want with the mouse, or press &amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt; to do the same thing? Pretty much nothing. It completes to 'cw' and the Intellisense drop down disappears. now you're sitting there looking at a line of code that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cw&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woohoo. Snippets are cool, aren't they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you didn't know that &lt;em&gt;you need to hit&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;at this point to expand the snippet&lt;/em&gt;, you'd be wondering what the fuss was all about (as I was until tonight). So ultimately what you need to do is type&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cw &amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt; &amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...where the first &amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt; simply gets rid of the Intellisense drop down, and the second &amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt; actually performs the expansion. Well I feel stupid now, and I hope that at least one other person is as dim as me, otherwise this post will have been simply exposing my naivete :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it just me, or is this somewhat unintuitive? When the intellisense feedback disappeared, I simply assumed the fireworks were over and typed out Console.WriteLine by hand. But never again!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>9</thr:total></entry><entry><id>17567</id><published>2005-12-19T19:34:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-12-19T19:34:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Keith finally learns how to use snippets</title><content type="html">Very amusing, Keith. I wrote a very similar post about two weeks ago where I claimed to be the second to last developer to finally figure out snippets. A lot of developers have approached me claiming to be the last. Seems like you too can join that merry club!

&lt;br /&gt;I would agree with you.

&lt;br /&gt;

It's either stored in a cookie, or mangled into the URL. Regardless, have you ever considered what would happen if a user were to make small changes to (or wholesale replace) that state? It's really easy to do if you have the right tools (all you need is a browser to play with mangled URLs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you need is tamper detection. And it's really pretty easy to implement (you get it for free if you're storing your state in a forms auth cookie). A simple approach is to use a keyed hash, preferably a tried-and-true algorithm like HMAC coupled with a decent cryptographic hash like SHA1. The idea works like this: you hash the data you're going to give to the user, but you hash it along with a secret that only your web server knows. Then you send the data (not the secret) to the user, with the hash value embedded in it. When you get that data back, before using it, you strip off the hash, and do the same computation (using the same key) and ensure that the hashes match. If they do, you can feel confident that the data hasn't been tampered with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the code for a simple class that does just that, along with a method for generating a random key that you can stuff in your web.config file. This class was written as a sample; one obvious improvement would be key versioning - you don't want to assume you'll be using the same key a year from now!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;using System;
using System.Text;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Configuration;
public class TamperDetector {
    public static string AddTamperDetection(string s) {
        byte[] data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(s);
        byte[] hash = getKeyedHash().ComputeHash(data);
        return Convert.ToBase64String(hash) + '|' + s;
    }
    public static string CheckAndRemoveTamperDetection(string s) {
        int i = s.IndexOf('|');
        if (-1 == i) throw new Exception("Malformed string");
        string prefix = s.Substring(0, i);
        string suffix = s.Substring(i+1);
        byte[] hash = Convert.FromBase64String(prefix);
        byte[] data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(suffix);
        byte[] computedHash = getKeyedHash().ComputeHash(data);
        if (!isEqual(hash, computedHash))
            throw new Exception("String has been modified!");
        return suffix;
    }
    static HMACSHA1 getKeyedHash() {
        string skey = ConfigurationSettings.AppSettings["integrityKey"];
        byte[] key = Convert.FromBase64String(skey);
        return new HMACSHA1(key);
    }
    static bool isEqual(byte[] a, byte[] b) {
        if (a.Length != b.Length) return false;
        for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; a.Length; ++i)
            if (a[i] != b[i]) return false;
        return true;
    }
    public static string GenerateRandomKey() {
        byte[] rnd = new byte[16]; // 128 bits
        new RNGCryptoServiceProvider().GetBytes(rnd);
        return Convert.ToBase64String(rnd);
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's some code that tests it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;using System;
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlClient;
class Program {
 static void Main(string[] args) {
        try {
            if (args.Length != 1) {
                Console.WriteLine("Usage: tamperDetect stringToProtect");
                return;
            }
            string p = TamperDetector.AddTamperDetection(args[0]);
            Console.WriteLine(p);
            string c = TamperDetector.CheckAndRemoveTamperDetection(p);
            Console.WriteLine(c);
        }
        catch (Exception x) {
            Console.WriteLine(x);
        }
 }
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll need a config file with an appSettings section that has a valid key. Kinda like this (but please use the key generation function to generate your own in production!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;appSettings&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;add key='integrityKey' value='IGEbiRJcL/EHl+kCSd5TDw=='/&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/appSettings&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what it looks like when run:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;91 C% tamperDetect "Hello world"

I should have mentioned that in the article. If someone *does* want to work with certificates (which adds a certain amount of overhead in several dimensions :) then CMS would definitely be the way to go. And .NET 2.0 makes this really easy - no more CAPICOM :)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Because the design of the system includes trusted keys (keys that I generate), I wanted to avoid going down the cert rathole. Of course then I was stuck building my own enveloping mechanism. I figured the tradeoff there was reasonable.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Some of the reasons why I like to work with certificates are:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Even if you don't want to use certificates to implement a particular trust model per se, there *is* some value in using certificates to manage public keys.
&lt;br /&gt;	
&lt;br /&gt;For example, the Windows platform has good administrative support for managing the certificates on a system, whereas, working with keys directly requires programmatic control, i.e., you had to write your own key manager rather than use the platform's certificate manager, which most SAs are already familiar with for configuring SSL, etc.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Also, for certs such as X509, the "meta data" bound to the key is quite handy for more than trust models -- in particular the validity period is very useful indeed -- your column mentioned the importance of key size, also as important is key lifetime, X509 certs are one good way of tracking this
&lt;br /&gt;	
&lt;br /&gt;I agree that getting PKIs/trust models/etc. correct to the point where they actually provide meaningful value is no walk in the park, but for simple things, I've really liked certs and find them easy to use (even easier to use now with .NET 2.0), so I'd like to just defend them a bit and say that they're not always all that bad ;-)</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="17634"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>17801</id><published>2006-01-03T22:48:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-01-03T22:48:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Encrypting without secrets</title><content type="html">Point well taken!</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="17634"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>17976</id><published>2006-01-12T05:20:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-01-12T05:20:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Encrypting without secrets</title><content type="html">Only two containers are accessible to all users

&lt;br /&gt;The trend seems to be to simply push the security burden onto the end user.  The "solution" to every tricky situation seems to be to ask the user if it's OK to do something that may or may not be bad.
&lt;br /&gt;	
&lt;br /&gt;While of course non-interactive, automatic bad things are certainly not the answer, the reactionary "solution" to simply insert some canned interaction prior to the bad things happening isn't the answer either.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;You don't need more than 14 words or 7 dialogs
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;A single dialog with a few words that simply pushes the security burden onto the end-user is all it takes -- heck, you could just push this into the EULA and be done with it ;-)  Vendors could still claim "we warned you," which is really the only "benefit" of any security dialog for the average, non security-professional user, no matter how many with any count of words</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="17636"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>17802</id><published>2006-01-03T22:54:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-01-03T22:54:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Dialogs that have more than 14 words</title><content type="html">Hehe, I've not gotten *quite* that cynical :) For example, in Firefox, I've not turned off the feature that warns me when I click an executable file from the download manager.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I know that one of the *goals* of the whole UAC drive is to significantly reduce the number of places in which you need elevation to get things done.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Right now they seem to be in a sort of half-way house. The elevation is somewhat in-your-face. (Although not really significantly worse than the non-admin life in XP - you have to elevate manually there at least as often in my experience.)

&lt;br /&gt;The goal is to move towards elevation as being a fairly unusual thing. But what troubles me is whether they'll have time to finish that, now that we're supposed to be quite close to release...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The example you've linked to here looks to me like a combination of two problems: 1) unfinished integration of UAC into the user experience and 2) the fact that in 5270, the shell prompts are all over the place.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who's made any serious attempt to use build 5270 will know that the shell is barely useable on this build. They seem to be in the process of revamping lots of stuff, including prompts like this.  But it all seems a long way from done. (My personal favourite is the new conflict resolution dialog that lets you choose what to do when a copy or move would overwrite a file - it shows identical icons for both files, with no way of telling which is which, and asks you to choose which one to keep...)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So this just seems like a typical example of how they've not finished joining the dots yet.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I sure hope they finish it before shipping...</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="17636"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>17911</id><published>2006-01-08T15:41:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-01-08T15:41:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Visual Studio 2005 extensibility</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was building a data access layer today and got really sick of typing data-holder classes that are really only around to make the GUI guy's life easier when he goes to use databinding (which requires properties). Kind of like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;public class IReallyHateTypingThese {
    public IReallyHateTypingThese(int a, int b, string foo, System.DateTime bar) {
        this.a = a;
        this.b = b;
        this.foo = foo;
        this.bar = bar;
    }
    public int A { get { return a; } }
    public int B { get { return b; } }
    public string Foo { get { return foo; } }
    public System.DateTime Bar { get { return bar; } }
    #region privates
    readonly int a;
    readonly int b;
    readonly string foo;
    readonly DateTime bar;
    #endregion
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much of that is redundant, so I spent a few hours learning the VS extensibility model and wrote a macro that would generate the goop above from a simple class declaration like the one below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;public class IReallyHateTypingThese {
    int a;
    int b;
    string foo;
    DateTime bar;
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a good experience - I learned how to write smart macros that examine the code around the selection point, determine its context, and work from there. To convert the above class, you simply need to place the insertion point anywhere inside the class definition and my macro will figure out the class name and the fields using something called the CodeModel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CodeModel is a bit quirky, and I went through a few iterations before I finally felt I'd come close to mastering it. For one thing, it's very much designed with VB code in mind. It has features that are specific to VB syntax and omits features specific to my preferred language, C#. Oh, and if you're writing macros, it looks like you're stuck using VB, although an add-in can do the same things from any language (I stuck with macros because the development cycle of an add-in seems pretty painful - you can't recompile without unloading the thing, and I've not figured out how to unload it without shutting down VS). There are also a few things that don't work quite as advertised. I couldn't get DestructiveInsert to actually destroy selected text, for example. I also found a few places where I got “Not Implemented” exceptions. All of these problems were pretty easy to work around. Even with its warts, the CodeModel is pretty darn useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing in particular that I learned is that it's best to move the TextSelection around as you're generating code, instead of trying to work with the less flexible EditPoint. Just call TextSelection.MoveToPoint to move it where you want it to go and party on. EditPoints are useful as bookmarks since they seem to stay put even as you're changing code around them, but I couldn't figure out how to even insert a newline using an EditPoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've never played around with the CodeModel, this example should help you get started. Now that I'm over the learning curve, I think I'll be using this a lot more often. Here's the code that does the transformation above. It includes a couple of subroutines that I thought would be useful in other code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Imports System

Finally I just couldn't take it anymore, when on a brand new paved machine, I couldn't get Outlook to expand email addresses automatically when I send mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know how Outlook usually manages to autocomplete names for you? I can type in “fritz”, and by the time I hit &lt;em&gt;send&lt;/em&gt;, Outlook has expanded “fritz” to his full email address, usually along with a nice display name. But for a bunch of names this just doesn't seem to work. And if you press send, you're hit with a dialog that shows you that there is a duplicate entry in the address book for that person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally got sick of this behavior and figured out a) what was going on, and b) how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) Your address book is just a special view on your contacts folder (if you're using Outlook like me, that is - in a corporate environment this may not be the case). You need to be aware that Outlook treats Fax numbers specially - your address book considers a fax number to be a first class citizen. So if I have &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/fritz" title="Fritz Onion, author of Essential ASP.NET"&gt;Fritz&lt;/a&gt;'s fax number in my contact card for Fritz, he'll have &lt;em&gt;two entries&lt;/em&gt; in the address book (at least this is the case with the Business Fax number).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) The solution I discovered (unfortunately I don't recall the link or I'd post it here to give the author credit) is to precede the fax number with some text. For example, change &lt;strong&gt;123-555-1212&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Fax: 123-555-1212&lt;/strong&gt;. Problem solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally don't use fax numbers to automatically send faxes, so this works for me, and I suspect it will also work for a number of you guys who have probably run into the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this removes an iota of frustration from your day!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>17962</id><published>2006-01-11T15:35:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-01-11T15:35:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Outlook having trouble expanding email addresses?</title><content type="html">Dude, you just published my fax number to the world - thank a lot!</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="17954"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>18315</id><published>2006-01-27T09:56:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-01-27T09:56:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Outlook having trouble expanding email addresses?</title><content type="html">when isend email then look in outbox it says message not sent when i sent it all addresses r rite</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="17954"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>18316</id><published>2006-01-27T09:57:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-01-27T09:57:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Outlook having trouble expanding email addresses?</title><content type="html">can anyone tell me wot 2 do i hit sent look in outbox and it says i havent sent</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="17954"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>43675</id><published>2006-11-30T15:18:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-11-30T15:18:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Outlook having trouble expanding email addresses?</title><content type="html">I have many contacts in Outlook but they do not show up in my address book.

I've &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.GuideBook/HowToGetATokenForAUser.html"&gt;fixed it in the online version&lt;/a&gt;, in case any of you were trying to use it. It was the code that used NegotiateStream to establish a logon for a user given her user name and password. You basically act out both sides of the negotiation, but in order to do this, you need to use a full duplex stream (my original code was using a MemoryStream, which isn't duplex). You also need asynchrony. Simply calling AuthenticateAsClient followed by AuthenticateAsServer won't work, because it's assumed these bits of code are running on different threads (usually in different processes on different machines, even!) To solve this, I use async sockets with TcpListener on the loopback address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Not at the same time as you're identifying the user. You see, SSPI will validate the origin of the request. If it originated from a program running under the user's credentials, you're authenticating the user. You might know the machine's IP address, but there's no proof she's really coming from that machine unless you're using IPSEC under the covers or some other VPN technique.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, if the request originates from a program running as SYSTEM or Network Service on the client's machine (and only if you're running in a domain), then it's actually running using the machine's domain credentials, not the user's credentials. When you use SSPI to validate the caller's creds at this point, you'll see the user's machine account.

&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the reply. So you are saying that having a process running as NETWORK SERVICE or SYSTEM on a machine (that is member of an AD Domain) be an SSPI client, is the indirect way of verifying the client machine identity. It makes sense to me thiking about it, because I suppose that how Windows (server) machines can get things such as Group Policy information from AD without a user ever logging on the machine.

The idea is to see what is relying on these before attempting to disable the same.

In order to validate my setup, It would be really nice to be able to generate arbitrary auth traffic using LM, NTLMv1 and NTLMv2. Does SSPI Workbench do this? If so how can a person obtain a copy?

Alternateively, do you know of any classes in .Net that would allow the same? If so I could try to put something together using powershell.

I was able to reproduce the problem - in fact, my notes also were corrupted. There is a bug in the current version of PWM - when you change your master passwords, the notes weren't being encrypted using the new key. Unfortunately since the salt value for each record also changes, unless you've got a backup of your password file prior to when you changed your master password, you won't be able to recover your notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've fixed the problem and have a new version available now. But I'm not going to go live with these anymore until I get some volunteers to help me test first. If you'd like to help out, please back up your password file (don't forget to do this!), download the version below, and run it for a week. Email me your feedback (the readme file shows what's changed - besides this bug fix there were a couple minor nits that I fixed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I get some feedback, I'll make a public release. Thanks for your patience and any cycles you can donate to help make Password Minder better. For those of you who don't have the time to help out, be sure to back up your password file regularly, and &lt;em&gt;avoid changing your master password&lt;/em&gt; until I get this new version out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT: One last point I forgot to mention - this new version was built using version 2.0 of the .NET Framework. I figured it was time to upgrade now that we're at RTM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;We could provide alternate storing locations like ftp or a online storage WebService.  Another idea would be use the "ClickOnce" approach that MS included into VS2005.

&lt;br /&gt;another problem, which prevented me from

&lt;br /&gt;When I copied my old pwm.xml to a new 
&lt;br /&gt;PC and download the previous version (1_5_0_8),
&lt;br /&gt;then invoked pwm.exe, entered my password, 
&lt;br /&gt;then pwm.exe threw IndexOutOfRangeException.
&lt;br /&gt;It appears that record.EncryptedUserId was
&lt;br /&gt;an empty string, as the result when _decrypt called 
&lt;br /&gt;RijndaelManagedTransform.TransformFinalBlock,
&lt;br /&gt;which called  RijndaelManagedTransform.DecryptData,
&lt;br /&gt;it threw IndexOutOfRangeException.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I see that 1_5_0_9 asigns null instead of ""
&lt;br /&gt;as the default value for EncryptedUserId,
&lt;br /&gt;which fixed the problem.

&lt;br /&gt;Upon further testing it appears that the problem is related to deleting and PASTING into the "character set" edit box.  If I delete the characters I don't want to allow and type in the ones I do (such as 0,O,I,1,l, etc.) then it works okay even though it includes the same character set that I previously obtained by pasting over the existing character set.

&lt;br /&gt;Password Minder is conservative here - it only allows simple ASCII characters.

It's supposed to be annoying so that you don't leave it up all the time ;-)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I designed PWM to be popped up every time you need it, and put away when you're not using it. If you don't close the application, you're reducing the security it provides significantly because your master key is in memory.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Technically the reason it is an "on top" window is because a lot of logon windows also mark themselves as "on top" and it's really hard to use PWM if it's hidden behind your logon window. I didn't like having to design it this way (with the "on top" style) but I found myself forced to do it because of those cases.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="18038"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>46177</id><published>2007-02-21T04:41:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-02-21T04:41:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: PasswordMinder users please read!</title><content type="html">Keith,

&lt;br /&gt;I understand your point about not leaving it up all the time. But having the window on top when the application is a bit annoying. I understand the point about it acting like a logon window, but (more often than not) I don't use it that way.

Just to keep anyone who cares abreast with what I've been up to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave some security talks at VSLive San Fransisco; the audience seemed to really like them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been helping to prepare material for Microsoft's Vista Ascend training program, which Ian, Kirk, and Mark have been delivering around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been prepping to deliver the Microsoft Longhorn Server Ascend training program, and I had my first delivery last week in Sydney, Australia. The week was splendid - we covered WCF, WF, and Identity (including InfoCard, ADFS, and all kinds of other cool security topics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week I'm teaching in Redmond, it's our &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/courses/CampsightDSA.aspx"&gt;Campsight event&lt;/a&gt; again - there's still time to &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/courses/CampsightDSA.aspx"&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt; if you want to join us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week after that I'm in Beijing teaching the Longhorn Server Ascend, and two weeks after that, I'm in Prague doing the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In between all that stuff I'm working with some of the MS technical evangelists on putting together some cool new MSDN content for Identity and Access Management, but I can't give you much more detail than that at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So bear with me if I'm not too responsive via email; I've got a lot on my plate but it should cool down around April.&lt;/p&gt;

This is yet another reason I've been dark ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are six modules, each with a 5-10 minute demo where I'm showing attack and defense for various input validation vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting. Then there's a corresponding lab that will walk you through the problem and show you how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are security basics that &lt;em&gt;every developer should know&lt;/em&gt;, not just the guy in charge of the security system. I've often said that every developer in the world needs to have at least a day of basic security training, and this is one way to get at least part of that training in the comfort of your own home.&lt;/p&gt;

The only touristy thing I did during the week was to visit Silk Street, a multi-story bazaar with vendors packed so tightly in the aisles that it feels like an indoor version of a swap meet (compressed into a space about 25% of the size). The rest of the time I spent with the locals, having lunch every day in traditional Chinese style.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, I wasn't ever allowed to be the last person on the elevator, and rarely could I carry my own bags, no matter how much I protested. I made a number of new friends, including Qi Li from MS China who was my guide during the week, accompanying me back and forth between the hotel and the venue (which was about 45 minutes each way via taxi). We were both very curious about each other's cultures, and given the language gap, almost every day found ourselves explaining the meaning behind words in English and Chinese. My Chinese friends were impressed at how well I could handle chopsticks - this week made me very glad for my practice over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the last day of class, which coincidentally was also my birthday, Mr. Li and his friends from work took me out to dinner in an area known to the locals as the “back side”. The back side is a set of restaurants and bars that ring part of a lake that is one of the several near the forbidden city. We arrived at twilight, with lights reflecting off the water and little bats flying above the lake looking for insects to snack on. Before going into a restaurant, several of us kicked around a &lt;a href="http://www.andrewyoon.com/journal_shanghai/images/2005/0306-05.jpg"&gt;skill toy called Jianxi&lt;/a&gt; that one of the fellows brought along (plays just like a hackysack, but looks nothing like it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the best dinner I'd had all week, which included many exotic entrees such as stomach, fish skin, jellyfish, goose intestine, and duck blood (which I thought was pretty tasty until my friends started making me queasy by reminding me over and over what I'd just eaten), we headed over to a bar that's a favorite hangout for this gang from MS China. It's a very cosy place (so much so that I'm surprised Steve DiMarco made it up the stairs - he's a very tall guy, and the stairway is very narrow and short). We pushed around some couches upstairs and drank Tsing Tao to the sound of a musician singing and playing the guitar. I pulled out my yo at some point and practiced some drunken throwing to the cheers of my friends, who were holding the hanging lights so they acted as spotlights so I could see my string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning before taking me to the airport, Mr. Li took me to a large park behind the forbidden city where the locals go to exercise and play. I saw people practicing Tai Chi, dancing together, kicking around Jianxi, and playing with lots of other skill toys. These are my kind of people! Mr. Li took me around to an area in the park where several retired fellows come to throw &lt;a href="http://www.chineseyoyo.org/"&gt;Chinese yoyos&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabolo"&gt;Diabolo&lt;/a&gt; descended from this toy) and play poker. We spent about an hour with these folks, where I learned to throw and showed them some tricks on my yo (I took it apart for them to see - I don't think they'd seen a modern yoyo before with a bearing). Mr. Li bought me a birthday gift: a Diabolo and a &lt;a href="http://www.chineseyoyo.org/video/top.mpg"&gt;single-head Chinese yo&lt;/a&gt; for when I get better at the sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the week I learned a little about what it's like to live in Beijing. Yet again I'm reminded that no matter how different the culture, people are basically the same everywhere you go. Thanks very much to all my new Chinese friends. I'll never forget you!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>22686</id><published>2006-04-25T06:56:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-04-25T06:56:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Back from Beijing</title><content type="html">You sure it's called Jianxi, not Jianzi? :)</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="20263"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>22694</id><published>2006-04-25T08:22:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-04-25T08:22:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Back from Beijing</title><content type="html">I got the spelling off the Internet, but I'm happy to be corrected by a native :)</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="20263"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>22814</id><published>2006-04-26T14:49:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-04-26T14:49:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Back from Beijing</title><content type="html">Well, actually 'Jianxi' means the 'game of Jianzi' (which I didn't realize until I did a little googling), where 'Jianzi' is the name commonly used to refer to the skill toy you were talking about. 'xi' means 'game' here. It's more often used to refer to operas or dramas.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So, to make it clear, Jianzi is the toy, and Jianxi is the game. :)</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="20263"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>20338</id><published>2006-03-20T12:41:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-03-20T12:41:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">ACE Threat Modeling</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The ACE team inside Microsoft has produced &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/security/securecode/threatmodeling/acetm/"&gt;a tool (code named Torpedo) for building threat models&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;br /&gt;client RpcBindingSetAuthInfo(Handle,
&lt;br /&gt;"localhost",
&lt;br /&gt;RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_DEFAULT,
&lt;br /&gt;RPC_C_AUTHN_WINNT,

&lt;br /&gt;server RpcServerRegisterAuthInfo("localhost",
&lt;br /&gt;RPC_C_AUTHN_WINNT,
&lt;br /&gt;NULL,
&lt;br /&gt;NULL).
&lt;br /&gt;And the function does work without changing the registerkey or the groupedit in sp2, and now the new demand is coming that the SSP "RPC_C_AUTHN_WINNT" in these functions have to change to "RPC_C_AUTHN_GSS_KERBEROS" to improve the security level, but the new codes always make a exception of "1747" wich refers to the Unknown authen service, have you ever met this? my eamil is zengxudong20@yahoo.com.cn,I am waitting for your callback,thank you.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="20338"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>20418</id><published>2006-03-21T06:38:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-03-21T06:38:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Interesting Finds</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="20338"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>20471</id><published>2006-03-21T22:22:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-03-21T22:22:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Link Listing - March 21, 2006</title><content type="html">ACE Threat Modeling

whirlwind February and March have been. Sydney one week, home the next, Campsight in Redmond the next week, home for a week, then off to Beijing for a week, home for a week and then off to Prague. I'm happy to say that I've not got much travel on my calendar for the next few months other than some brief conference appearances. My family is happy about that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I taught the Longhorn Server Ascend training class in Prague to the most diverse group of students I think I've ever taught. We had folks from many countries: Czech Republic, Slovakia, Spain, Poland, Austria, Switzerland, Britain, South Africa, and that's only the ones I can remember!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people had good English skills which made my life a lot easier during the week, and in the evenings, I had the pleasure of hanging out with many of the students as we explored Prague. One particular evening (don't ask me to remember which one - I'm glad I made it back to the Hotel that night) I went out drinking with a couple students and besides enjoying plenty of local Czech beer, we threw back a few shots of absinth. I brought home a bottle just for fun - that's some seriously powerful stuff; it's not sold in many countries, and certainly not here on Colorado, where the damn liquor stores are closed on Sundays :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prague is a beautiful city; you must see it if you get a chance to travel to Europe. Any direction you walk there's something interesting to see. Just don't expect to see many South African girls there! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>21416</id><published>2006-04-10T07:57:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-04-10T07:57:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Password Minder v1.5.0.9 released</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note that this version requires v2.0 of the .NET framework&lt;/strong&gt;, which you can download &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0856eacb-4362-4b0d-8edd-aab15c5e04f5&amp;amp;displaylang=en"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So be sure you've got your cursor right where you want the password typed, then press the hotkey for PWM (you did set up a shortcut with a hotkey, like the README file talks about, right?)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Just a reminder to new users - be sure to read the README file, and pay close attention to the section that talks about backing up your password file and putting your master password somewhere safe where you won't lose it!</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="21416"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>21696</id><published>2006-04-12T19:06:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-04-12T19:06:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Password Minder v1.5.0.9 released</title><content type="html">Did't read through the whole readme, I guess I was real excited to use it!! :)

&lt;br /&gt;A problem to report (admittedly with 1.05.08 as I haven't had a chance to look at the new one yet): it is possible to accidentally launch more than one instance.  When this happens, the last instance closed wins, so password entries created may be lost depending on which instance was used to create the entry and the order in which the instances were closed.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In all likelyhood the notes for your records are corrupt due to that bug. To see if this is the problem, open the password file in a text editor and delete all the encryptedNotes attributes. You should then be able to change your master password.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Vista is even worse because of the way focus works (when you hit a keyboard shortcut, focus goes to the taskbar). I have to cut and paste everything there at the moment.

After getting the Longhorn Server Ascend training wrapped up last month, I got caught up with MSDN articles, writing a couple pieces on InfoCard (one of which is &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/04/SecurityBriefs/"&gt;already available on MSDN&lt;/a&gt;, and one that will be coming soon). &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/"&gt;TechNet Magazine&lt;/a&gt; pinged me at the last minute asking me to write an InfoCard piece for them as well, which worked out well since my head was in that space anyway; that article would be a good one to show the pointy haired boss in your org if you want them to learn a bit about where we're headed on this platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wrapped up a 40-page whitepaper for Microsoft about building identity aware apps. It's very close to being published, and I think it's one of the best stories I've ever told, so I hope you'll enjoy it. I promise to blog this as soon as it's available. It's more of an introduction than a drill down, but it'll be great for folks who are new to identity on this platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/fritz" title="Fritz Onion, author of Essential ASP.NET"&gt;Fritz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/matt/default.aspx"&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt;, and I shipped the bits for the next version of the Connected Systems Business kit. If you want to see an great example of simple authorization using nested account and resource groups, Kerberos and Active Directory integration, you should keep your eyes peeled for this one. It's not yet available to the general public, but I'll blog a link when it is. The older version is here. Pluralsight developed both the training materials and the implementation for the new version, which is based on v2.0 of the .NET Framework and BizTalk 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that most of my external contractual obligations are fulfilled, I've been going heads down building infrastructure for Pluralsight. I'm automating a number of tasks to help streamline our business processes behind the scenes. I've been doing so much T-SQL lately that I'm starting to put @ signs in front of my variables when I'm writing C# :) But seriously, it's been a great change of pace for me. &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dan/default.aspx"&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt; would be proud of me - I built a rather elegant query around my first full outer join last night.&lt;/p&gt;

Write less code, get better security, etc. This is a story I've been perfecting over the last five years or so, and now with claims-based systems like ADFS and InfoCard coming to life, there's a new reason to tell it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more of a seminar or workshop - it's all about lecture and discussion. I'll point you to some hands-on labs you can use on the web, but we won't be doing them in class. The time will be spent covering as much ground as we can in two days. &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/SecurityWorkshop.aspx"&gt;Here's the outline of the course&lt;/a&gt; if you want more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/aaron/archive/2006/04/17/21873.aspx"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/aaron" title="Aaron Skonnard, MSDN columnist: XML Files"&gt;Aaron&lt;/a&gt;'s lead, I'm hoping to get some feedback from you guys to guage interest. If we get five or so people in a major metropolitan area who are interested, we can schedule a class there. Ping me via &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/contact.aspx"&gt;this contact form&lt;/a&gt; if you're interested, and let me know the major city where you'd like us to hold the class.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>75734</id><published>2010-03-31T10:45:30.0-05:00</published><updated>2010-03-31T10:45:30.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Security Briefs :The Photo Corner</title><content type="html">Pingback from  Security Briefs :The Photo Corner</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="22922"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>24964</id><published>2006-05-24T06:03:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-05-24T06:03:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Security questions considered dangerous</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I'm wrapping up the security chapter for &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/fritz/archive/2006/03/14/20048.aspx"&gt;Essential ASP.NET 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, I'm putting together some guidance for using SqlMembershipProvider. One of the things that really bothers me about this class is the ease of which one can reset a users password by answering a single question that the user specifies when creating her account. There's nothing stopping the user from asking a question that is easily answered by a 6 year old:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's 2 plus 2?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or even a question that's easily answered given some public knowledge about the user:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What street do you live on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or something you could easily find out from a user by asking her:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's your favorite color? What's the name of your dog?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it ironic that SqlMembershipProvider goes to great lengths to allow you to control password complexity, and yet still allows that password to be reset with a simple question/answer challenge. Sure, you can turn off the password reset feature, but that's not necessarily optimal either. What would be great is if we could replace the question/answer challenge with something better, for example, the system proposed in &lt;em&gt;Building Secure Software&lt;/em&gt; by Viega &amp;amp; McGraw. In Viega's solution, the user doesn't get to write the questions - the system designer comes up with a long list of questions, asking the user to pick M questions and supply answers. Then at password reset time, we randomly choose N of those questions and ask the user to answer at least P questions from that list. M, N, and P would be variables you control based on your security posture (risk tolerance versus ease of use).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PayPal, for example, follows this procedure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) You must choose an email address that PayPal already has on file for you. Password reset instructions are sent to this email. The form includes CAPTCHA to detect bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Once you get the email, you must click through a link to access the password reset page. As with virtually all pages at PayPal, this runs over HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) The password reset page asks you to choose from several categories. You can either verify your full credit card number, your bank account number (if you've linked a bank account), or you can answer a couple of security questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PayPal currently offers four security questions, and you must supply answers to two of them. The questions they offer are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mother's maiden name, last 4 chars of drivers license, last 4 numbers of SSN, city of birth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm curious how others are automating password resets. It's an important feature, as password reset is one of the top reasons people call a help desk, but it's also a tough problem to solve.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>9</thr:total></entry><entry><id>24966</id><published>2006-05-24T06:49:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-05-24T06:49:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Security questions considered dangerous</title><content type="html">The biggest problem is that the reset method is an abstract method of the membershipprovider base class.

I've also been bothered with security questions that provide no security. My solution is to lie, and regularly give nonsensical answers ("In what month did you get married? Orange"). The security questions and answers get put in my PaswordSafe account for that site.

This provides a more secure solution, at least for me. It is funny, though, the few times I've had to give answers to security questions over the phone. :)

The last time I checked, in 1.x ASP.NET assigned a persistent forms cookie an expiration date that was 50 years in the future. But the code looks very different in 2.0. If you ask for a persistent cookie, you get one with an expiration equal to DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(T), where T is the timeout that you've configured for Forms login (which defaults to 30 minutes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may surprise you (and your users) if you're upgrading to 2.0, so be aware. It's certainly better from a security point of view not to assign a login cookie that lasts for 50 years. But it changes things pretty dramatically from a usability standpoint, and there's always that tradeoff...&lt;/p&gt;

At some point, after getting the latest iPod updater, my iPod stopped being recognized by iTunes. I finally sat down tonight and solved the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what I did. I uninstalled iTunes (prolly didn't need to do this, but I was following Apple's instructions) and the iPod updater, reinstalled the new one, rebooting WAY too many times (I think Steve Jobs is punishing Windows users for not purchasing macs - their Windows software is really awful). The iPod was still not recognized. BUT, it did show up in Device Manager, although it didn't have a drive letter assigned to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assigned the I: drive letter (I doubt assigning the drive letter had anythign to do with solving the problem, but I'm mentioning it just in case). I then ran the Windows disk management tool (MMC, Add Remove Snap-in, Disk Management), and the iPod showed up there. I formatted it as Fat32, and reran the iPod updater software. Sure enough, it now recognized the iPod and allowed me to reset it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've not yet installed iTunes, but I'm pretty sure I've solved the problem at this point. Hope this helps someone out there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: I just finished installing iTunes, and it happily recognizes the nano again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>26391</id><published>2006-06-02T07:03:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-06-02T07:03:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: iPod nano shows up in device manager, iPod updater doesn't recognize it</title><content type="html">I gave up on itunes and use Anapod (http://www.redchairsoftware.com/anapod/) now.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style="FONT-SIZE: smaller"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASP.NET 2.0 ships with three role providers - one for SQL Server, one for AzMan and one for Windows tokens...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows token provider is special - it only works with Windows authentication whereas all the other providers seem to be more targeted at Forms Authentication (the AzMan provider supports both).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I need a role provider for Windows accounts? You don't have to take care of getting roles for Windows users as they come packaged in the token that gets procuced during authentication in IIS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well - the WindowsTokenRole provider can do some optimizations to Windows authentication&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of a WindowsPrincipal you get a RolePrincipal which features a method called GetRoles() that returns all roles as a string array. This is more straightforward than using the code I showed &lt;a href="http://www.leastprivilege.com/GettingAllGroupsForAWindowsAccountInNET20.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You still have access to the underlying WindowsIdentity (Context.User.Identity) and can create a WindowsPrincipal if you have to. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RoleManager can cache the roles. The first time you call IsInRole, RolePrincipal will fetch all roles from the token (which requires round trips to the DC to translate the SIDs to "human-readable" names. These names can get cached in the roles cookie (.aspxroles). This saves the roundtrip to the DC on subsequent requests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is really just an (optional) optimization for Windows authentication based web apps. If you want to use role caching make sure to set reasonable timeouts (e.g. 30mins) - otherwise group membership changes for the user will have a high latency in your application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the LSA already caches SID to name mappings, I dont think the second argument holds much water. Maybe the first might make sense, but this seems like a microoptimization, not a *compelling* reason to use WindowsTokenRoleProvider.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm still not convinced we need this class. I was originally thinking perhaps it might be useful as a polymorphic meeting place if you happened to be using both forms and integrated auth, which is pretty esoteric - not many people do this sort of thing (it's not obvious to many that it's even possible).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>26194</id><published>2006-05-31T17:14:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-05-31T17:14:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: WindowsTokenRoleProvider - Dominick's view</title><content type="html">What about as a "polymorphic meeting place" if you might switch auth providers?

&lt;p&gt;On the last day of class, one of the students gave me a demo of VeriSign's &lt;a href="http://www.verisign.com/products-services/security-services/identity-protection/fraud-detection.html"&gt;Fraud Detection System&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently being piloted by a number of companies. I'm always complaining about how we don't do enough in the detection space, and it was encouraging to see this system in action. This is the type of system that a bank might use to detect anomolies in a user's behavior. I was surprised at the number of attributes of any given request that are tracked by this system; even the type of browser you use is considered, which makes a lot of sense if you think about it.

The idea here is to move toward a more visual way for humans to recognize certificates. The InfoCard identity selector relies on these logos to help the user decide whether she wants to share identity details with a relying party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VeriSign has been issuing certificates with their own embedded logo for awhile now. As an example, if you visit &lt;a href="https://www.etrade.com"&gt;https://www.etrade.com&lt;/a&gt; and look at its certificate, you'll find a cert extension with an OID of 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.1.12, which is a logotype extension. In this extension, you'll see a mime type such as "image/gif", followed by some binary data, which is the hash of the image, followed by an URL pointing to the image on the web. The identity selector downloads the image, hashes it, checks that the computed hash matches the hash in the cert extension, and then displays the logo to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the rub. While VeriSign is happy to put its own logo in the certificate (the issuer logo), it's not quite as thrilled about putting subject logos in that extension, because the work that would go into verifying those logos can't all be automated, and requires further human intervention. (Consider due diligence such as making sure one guy isn't trying to spoof another guy's logo by making one that looked a lot like it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the guys in the class made contact with the SSL engineering team at VeriSign and confirmed that indeed subject logotypes aren't on their roadmap, which doesn't bode well for the use of subject logos in the identity selector. I've also heard rumors inside Microsoft that the use of logos may need to be postponed. I wonder if this feature will just be dropped? That would be unfortunate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>9</thr:total></entry><entry><id>27214</id><published>2006-06-08T17:22:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-06-08T17:22:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Certificates with logotypes</title><content type="html">How would the average customer, looking at a web page containing an image, distinguish if the image is a real logotype from VeriSign or just yet another phishing style GIF?

&lt;br /&gt;The problem seems to be that you contacted a member of the engineering team. That is not a good way to get accurate information on future plans.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;At present the requirements for issuing certificates in IE7 are being discussed by a cross vendor forum. The requirements that the group has produced for 'Extended Validation' certificates (also known at one point as High Assurance) will be enforced in IE7. If you have an EV certificate the toolbar will 'go green' when you are connected to the site via SSL.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;At this point discussion has not yet started on the criteria for issuing Logotype certificates, the plan is to move onto this topic only after the basic EV discussion is complete. It is clear that meeting the EV criteria will be the essential minimum. What is necessary beyond that needs to have a wider debate amongst CAs and the providers of the relying applications.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Certainly there is a high degree of commitment to the idea of logotype certificates. I have spoken on the need for Secure Letterhead at 20 venues in the past 12 months and I have two more engagements next week. 
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'll tell you straight-up. Logo extensions are fully supported by CardSpace. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Here's the caveat: the committee for HA certificates is still working through some of the social/legal issues.  When those last few details are hammered out, new CA roots will be distributed, and certificates issued from those roots would be HA.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Aaaaaaand... logotype extensions are only shown in CardSpace for HA Certs. (aha!)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;My entire sample suite for CardSpace is all done under a set HA/LogoType'd certificates, all issued off a sample root CA.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I imagine what you are hearing is not the features are being put off, but rather that they are not being emphasized, as it will be still some time before the root CAs are distributed.

Today the consumer (after downloading our plug in) sees gold locks next to the sender's name (in an area that bad guys can't easily diddle). A mouse over the gold lock in list view or full view displays a certificate. Some of our senders ask us to display a logo in addition to the gold lock, others just stick with the gold lock. Without a doubt, the most difficult task in doing this is the process of verifying the legitimacy of the mark, who owns it and are we working with the person(s) that have permission to use this mark. Integrity to this process is key!

I didn't attend the keynote, and was glad after I heard the reports - apparently it was very IT Pro focused - not a lot for devs, although I hear the 24 theme was entertaining at times. &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/fritz" title="Fritz Onion, author of Essential ASP.NET"&gt;Fritz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/aaron" title="Aaron Skonnard, MSDN columnist: XML Files"&gt;Aaron&lt;/a&gt; and I had plenty of time on Monday and Tuesday to network with our contacts at Microsoft, and we also hooked up with the folks who are putting together TechEd Barcelona in November. Looks like the three of us (plus one more - TBD) will be doing a precon tutorial on WinFx, as well as several breakout sessions. Given that the European show is developer focused (the following week is for IT Pros this time), it should be a much better show for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk on WCF security, and Fritz was instrumental in running the demos (thanks man, couldn't have done it nearly as smoothly without you). The evals were stellar - thanks to everyone who attended and especially everyone who was thoughtful enough to leave an eval. I love having a code monkey to help out - it allows me to get close to the audience and make the talk into more of a conversation instead of just a lecture.&lt;/p&gt;

Problem is, when you try to delete a folder on that drive, you'll be told you can't do it (Access Denied).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem has nothing to do with security - it's a lame recycle bin problem that's described in &lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/Default.aspx?kbid=319368"&gt;this KB article&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently recycle bin doesn't work well with mounted drives. You aren't going to get recycle bin support for that drive. To delete files, you'll need to use the SHIFT+DELETE trick (bypassing the recycle bin), or use the command line rd command or an equivalent, which also bypasses the bin.&lt;/p&gt;

The easiest way to demo this today is using Windows CardSpace (or WCS, formerly known as InfoCard), so I ended up talking a bit about WCS. And after my talk, the vast majority of questions were about WCS, which is great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One question that came up that morning (and always comes up) was about cross-platform support for CardSpace. Will the Mac have an identity selector? Will Linux? Can I write a relying party in Java? Can I do single sign on with InfoCard, or must I select a card for each application I visit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last two questions are answered by &lt;a href="http://www.identityblog.com/wp-content/images/2006/06/ping-infocard-demo.jpg"&gt;a demo&lt;/a&gt; that Ping Identity is giving this week at &lt;a href="http://catalyst.burtongroup.com/"&gt;Catalyst 2006&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="http://www.identityblog.com/?p=471"&gt;Kim&lt;/a&gt;). I've not seen any concrete statements about Mac and Linux identity selectors yet though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about this a lot lately as I see more and more systems that violate this rule. Take strong names as an example. When strong names were first introduced in verison 1 of the .NET Framework, I thought, “what a cool idea: instead of using GUIDs to identify pieces of code, use a public key, because it can double as a way to add tamper detection, author identity, etc.“ But the more I worked with the .NET Framework, the more I realized that using an RSA key as an identifier is actually a liability, not an asset. It's just adding another secret to your life that you wouldn't have had before. How many of you even bother to protect the private key for your strong names? I've seen more than one case where people shipped the key pair in a file along with their binaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the question you should ask yourself whenever you see a secret in a system: “How painful would it be to change that secret?“ How painful would it be for you to change the RSA key pair that you use to sign your assemblies? If you're using GAC versioning, you probably know that as soon as you change the public key (which changes the public key token) you've got an entirely new assembly as far as .NET is concerned - you've broken the versioning chain. Ouch. Oh, and did you realize that it's really easy for sysadmins to hang code access security policy off of a strong name? That policy is only as strong as the private key is secure! How do you revoke such a key if it's compromised? Once you start thinking about these issues, you may come to the same conclusion I did: “Why the hell do we have secrets as part of the assembly naming story at all?“ Hindsight is 20/20 - it sure did seem like a cool idea at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why we need to think about this earlier rather than later. As soon as you find yourself tempted to design a secret into a system, you'd should make sure your design makes that secret easy to change, otherwise it's likely to cause more harm than good. Cryptography is a dangerous panacea, “Social security numbers? No sweat, we've got 256-bit encryption!“ nevermind the fact that the private key ultimately protecting everything hasn't been changed since the system was deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do cryptographers call keys that are hard to change? I've been searching the net to find if there's a term for this, because I think it would be a useful addition to the lexicon. I've not yet found anything, so I'm tempted to suggest the term, “Heavy keys“. Lightweight keys are easy to change - many of them you don't even need to think about (consider a machine's password in a domain - it's automatically changed every 7 days, and many sysadmins don't even realize it exists). Heavy keys are so painful to change that in practice they never do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a bit of a different example: ASP.NET's machineKey. There's no versioning story behind that key; if you change it, anybody who has outstanding forms login cookies or viewstate will have trouble the next time they connect to the server. The login cookie is the least problematic - the user will simply be prompted to log in again (not that I've tested this, but it's the best possible outcome). With viewstate, an exception will be thrown as the state won't validate and the server will think it's been tampered with. These things may not be huge issues in the big scheme of things, but consider what happened in version 2.0 when the SqlMembershipProvider was added. Now you've got a provider that will happily encrypt user passwords for you using a non-versioned key. &lt;em&gt;Now&lt;/em&gt; what happens when you change out that machineKey? Suddenly when your existing users attempt to log in, they are denied access because you can no longer validate their passwords. And if you didn't back up the old key, you'd better start shining up your resume. If you plan ahead, you can work around this, but you'll need to write the code yourself to rekey the user database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's interesting about the machineKey example is this: here we have a key that already was a bit heavy (no support for versioning), but it suddenly got much heavier because of one feature (encrypted passwords). At that point, completely unrelated features (viewstate protection, forms login cookies, etc.) began to suffer because the one key protecting all of them suddenly became difficult to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably a lot of people who don't realize how important it is to change out keys regularly. Consider the uncomfortable position you may be in when your sysadmin quits and goes to work for your competition, taking your machineKey with him. Keep in mind that the longer a cryptographic key is used, the weaker and more valuable the key becomes, especially when persistent data is protected (directly or indirectly) with that key. Heavy keys as a category on Ebay - wouldn't that be a kick?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have InfoCard (well, CardSpace), which is really what got me thinking about this. But I think this post is probably useful on its own, so I'll talk about CardSpace keys in another post. But for now, I'm curious - &lt;strong&gt;where have you guys seen heavy keys&lt;/strong&gt;? Leave a comment if you know of such a system. Extra points if it's a system we all use regularly!&lt;/p&gt;

Think about it, it's supposed to be my secret so that when I apply for a credit card, a creditor knows exactly who I am. However as time goes by and I apply for one...two...three credit cards online, my social security number has been floated along a wire and who knows...at some point there very well may have been a vulnerability.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Another reason I nominate SSN's for the heaviest of heavy keys (I love the name btw), is that to be in line w/ your point of key's becoming more vulnerable with age, every moment I get older, my key gets weaker and weaker.

I don't have a server at home; I just use simple netbios broadcast name resolution, but suddenly I couldn't resolve my laptop's name anymore. I've &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/archive/2005/09/20/14917.aspx"&gt;posted about this problem before&lt;/a&gt;, but this time I actually spent some time learning what was going on under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than explain it in my own words, I'd like to point you to a &lt;a href="http://www.windowsitlibrary.com/Content/386/10/5.html"&gt;great article that discusses how netbios works&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately what happened to me was the last network I visited used DHCP to configure my machine to be a “P-node“ box (ipconfig /all shows Node Type: peer-peer). This requires a WINS server to resolve names, which I don't have at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I ended up deleting the &lt;a href="http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsServer/en/Library/8d54d7d8-21aa-441b-a54a-b943d19a927e1033.mspx"&gt;DhcpNodeType named value&lt;/a&gt; (it was set to 2, which is P-Node) under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netbt\Parameters key. Reboot and voila, problem solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're running a small network without a server, you would be well served to read &lt;a href="http://www.windowsitlibrary.com/Content/386/10/5.html"&gt;that article&lt;/a&gt;, and learn how to use nbtstat (it's pretty self-explanatory, but knowing it exists is useful). I'm now much better prepared for dealing with name resolution problems on my little home network :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>100</thr:total></entry><entry><id>76605</id><published>2010-05-13T10:14:03.0-05:00</published><updated>2010-05-13T10:14:03.0-05:00</updated><category

type="html">&lt;p&gt;Besides the fact that it comes with *two* disks - one with the OS and the other with all of the goodies like ADFS, there isn't anything obviously different about the operating system once you get it running. It looks rather like W2K3 SP1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/images/blogged/w2k3r2.jpg" /&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has anyone figured out yet if R2 is really just SP1 shipped with an extra disk? For testing/demo purposes, can I take an existing SP1 box and put ADFS on it? Just curious - it'd save me some time since I already have an SP1 VPC configured how I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE (10 Jul 2006, 4:35pm): Apparently DISK1 actually &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; just W2K3 SP1. When you install DISK2, you get the R2 upgrade and things look different. So it looks like you can save yourself some time by simply installing DISK2 over an existing SP1 install. I &lt;em&gt;am &lt;/em&gt;still curious though as to exactly what the difference is. I wonder if any of the core DLLs change. I guess I'll just have to do a diff and see.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>16</thr:total></entry><entry><id>31119</id><published>2006-07-10T09:53:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-07-10T09:53:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: W2K3 R2 - what is it, really?</title><content type="html">Interesting.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you used the MSDN or MS Licensing versions and keys for your W2k3 SP1 install you won't have a problem upgrading to R2.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you have an OEM key version of W2k3 SP1, it WILL NOT upgrade to R2.  The licensing and your use rights are different.  You will have to re-install the OS using an MSDN or MS License key before it will let up install R2.

&lt;p&gt;The first photo in the series shows what it's like if you just point your camera into the sky in a suburb and hold the shutter open for about 20 minutes or so. Even then you can see an incredible variance in color, and it's worth doing if you want to try it some time. Point at the north star for a nice effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The starfields were taken with an Olympus OM-1 (I use a really old camera that doesn't have a battery so that I can get 30+ minute exposures by manually locking the shutter open). The dense starfields were taken with the camera looking sideways into our galaxy, so they are rich with stars and detail. To counteract the rotation of the earth for the starfield photos (which were between 20 and 40 minutes exposure), I mounted the camera on the back of my telescope, which has a clock drive to compensate. No clock drive is perfect, so I stood there for each photo with a crosshair reticle eyepiece sighting on a bright star, stopping the drive or speeding it up as necessary to keep the setup lined up for the entire exposure. It's tiring, but the results were worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moon shot was me holding the camera sans lens over the eyepiece hole (sans eyepiece as well, if I recall) and just snapping a shot using the the telescope as the camera lens. I'm sure there's mounts that make this easier and more reliable, but it seemed to work reasonably well.

&lt;p&gt;This morning I sat down and built a little example to verify this. I created a simple service with an instance variable constructed from a GUID. The contract allows you to retrieve the ID from the service instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ServiceContract]&lt;br /&gt;public interface IMyContract {&lt;br /&gt;    [OperationContract]&lt;br /&gt;    string GetId();&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;public class MyService : IMyContract {&lt;br /&gt;    string id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();&lt;br /&gt;    public string GetId() {&lt;br /&gt;        return id;&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then exposed three endpoints from this service using three different standard bindings (without any binding adjustments): basicHttpBinding, wsHttpBinding, and netTcpBinding. My sample client then enumerated these endpoints making four calls to each endpoint using two proxies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Console.WriteLine(endpointName);&lt;br /&gt;Console.WriteLine(proxy1.GetId());&lt;br /&gt;Console.WriteLine(proxy1.GetId());&lt;br /&gt;Console.WriteLine(proxy2.GetId());&lt;br /&gt;Console.WriteLine(proxy2.GetId());&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the results (notice that with basicHttpBinding, you do indeed get PerCall instancing, but with the other two, you get PerSession):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;basic&lt;br /&gt;161ebbd5-bd95-466b-b43d-2972fe815bb7&lt;br /&gt;b8fc5ff9-669b-458f-b86f-598f9709d1b0&lt;br /&gt;96f7bb42-b093-4930-9a1d-33d0599632cf&lt;br /&gt;952ebd54-6501-4d10-8c16-7c51360ddfe7&lt;br /&gt;ws&lt;br /&gt;235cbdb3-b203-45a1-8807-60faeca97f95&lt;br /&gt;235cbdb3-b203-45a1-8807-60faeca97f95&lt;br /&gt;39b67030-94fa-4a28-852b-d1b4801b64ad&lt;br /&gt;39b67030-94fa-4a28-852b-d1b4801b64ad&lt;br /&gt;tcp&lt;br /&gt;e2fbc193-587d-4c07-80be-73351d6adbc9&lt;br /&gt;e2fbc193-587d-4c07-80be-73351d6adbc9&lt;br /&gt;490d29bc-c08b-4375-b85f-402f0cb5122b&lt;br /&gt;490d29bc-c08b-4375-b85f-402f0cb5122b&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also interesting to note that if I query the service host's description:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size="2" color="#008080"&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;host.Open();&lt;br /&gt;Console.WriteLine(host.Description.Behaviors.Find&lt;SERVICEBEHAVIORATTRIBUTE&gt;().InstanceContextMode);&lt;/SERVICEBEHAVIORATTRIBUTE&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This prints out PerSession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just for kicks, I turned off security on all the bindings to see what would happen if there were no session. Now the results looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;basic&lt;br /&gt;8af37970-f315-426c-a4cb-5807f64eee50&lt;br /&gt;20699967-7814-4b94-bec8-da3791788298&lt;br /&gt;723bfe78-a968-41c2-b1f2-f2b1c3eec0bb&lt;br /&gt;97837035-bef9-49ab-830a-151435951ac1&lt;br /&gt;ws&lt;br /&gt;468bafa5-baa6-4373-9118-dd74d138c73a&lt;br /&gt;ef30ce05-bb9a-4225-81b8-18de433c6fc5&lt;br /&gt;1c631970-6d85-4ccd-86c0-827466f67087&lt;br /&gt;34d651b1-0643-474b-9a3a-3b623dc4fde6&lt;br /&gt;tcp&lt;br /&gt;16d17346-cc6c-40c1-8c36-13027dd62904&lt;br /&gt;16d17346-cc6c-40c1-8c36-13027dd62904&lt;br /&gt;53db2f9a-85e0-4834-8272-bc2673043784&lt;br /&gt;53db2f9a-85e0-4834-8272-bc2673043784&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the only change is that wsHttpBinding is now using PerCall instead of PerSession, because that channel no longer supports sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I change my service definition to explicitly ask for PerCall, then I get PerCall instancing via all bindings, and the service description reports that the instance context mode is PerCall. Here's the attribute you put on the service type to control instancing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ServiceBehavior(InstanceContextMode=InstanceContextMode.PerCall)]&lt;br /&gt;public class MyService : IMyContract {&lt;br /&gt;    string id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();&lt;br /&gt;    public string GetId() {&lt;br /&gt;        return id;&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the safest bet is not to rely on the default, but to be explicit about your instancing mode. I'd love to hear from the WCF team whether they consider this a bug. One thing I can say for certain is that the documentation currently incorrect by saying PerCall is the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT (10:36AM): Apparently PerSession is supposed to revert to PerCall if no session is available. So in short, it appears that the documentation is simply incorrect and that PerSession is the default, not PerCall. I still want to know if this is by design, though ;-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>40527</id><published>2006-10-13T12:29:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-10-13T12:29:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: WCF instancing mode default</title><content type="html">Keith,
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The latest documentation from http://wcf.netfx3.com (I included the link in the Url box) states that the default for InstanceContextMode is PerSession. I guess the prerelease docs you have are incorrect.

&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;B: Windows XP Pro with IIS with integred security enabled and impersonate at true
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;Server:
&lt;br /&gt;C: W2K3 with Active Directory Domain.
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;My problem is when a user in computer A connect to web page on computer B with integred security and B talk to C to retreive user info, he cannot view her user info. But If a change B to basic authentification and B retreive user info on C, the user A can view her info on that web page.
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;How can I set the authentification for using integrated security only instead of basic authentification?

But now that PowerShell has been released, I'm going to make the switch.

Over time, I'll be building a collection of cmdlets to make my PowerShell environment a comfortable place to live. And the first one I'm writing is a replacement for my good friend clip.exe, which if you're one of the few people on the planet who don't use this great little tool,

dir \windows\system32 | clip

redirects the output of the command onto the clipboard so that I can paste it into notepad or some other tool.

So far so good. I've got a little cmdlet that calls Clipboard.SetDataObject. Only problem is, when I make that call, I get an exception that reminds me why I'm glad I'm not doing much COM programming anymore:

"Out-Clip : Current thread must be set to single thread apartment (STA) mode before OLE calls can be made. Ensure that your Main function has STAThreadAttribute marked on it."

Well, given that I'm writing a DLL, I don't have control over the threading model of PowerShell's thread. So it looks like I'll need to spawn a temporary thread that runs in an STA in order to set the clipboard.

I'll post the code for the cmdlet when it's done.</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>44489</id><published>2006-12-07T06:42:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-07T06:42:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Writing a PowerShell cmdlet: Out-Clip</title><content type="html">You will not need it when you use Vista.

&lt;br /&gt;They have out-clipboard, plus a whole load of other cmdlets. Its a community development project, with a couple devs who have been using powershell since beta. Have it on my box, and the alpha code is pretty stable.

$
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this shocked the hell outta me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, actually I lied, it's not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; that bad - this query actually returns one result, but it's for a function called Write-Error, which tells you nothing about how to do exception handling in PowerShell. And once you learn the two primary keywords for doing it (trap, throw), you won't get any help on those either. Turns out they just aren't documented in the current release, but the &lt;a href="http://www.sapienpress.com/powershell.pdf"&gt;Error Handling and Debugging chapter&lt;/a&gt; of Jones &amp;amp; Hicks book on PowerShell is available on the web that will help you get started. FWIW, I also found a &lt;a href="http://www.sapienpress.com/WindowsPowerShellTFM_Sample.pdf"&gt;couple more chapters&lt;/a&gt; available online from &lt;a href="http://www.sapienpress.com/powershell.asp"&gt;Sapien Press&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks, guys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I skimmed the chapter on the web and was able to get started. I'm recording a bit of what I discovered along the way so that others (myself included) will benefit from my research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here was the problem I wanted to solve. This particular problem isn't really that - it's nothing close to a showstopper for me, but I wanted to take the opportunity to learn how to do exception handling in PowerShell so that I would be ready when I really needed it. Anyway, I have this script that I use a lot to restart a process, which I'll call “foo“ for the sake of this post. Here's the two-liner script:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;function restartFoo {
  get-process “foo” | stop-process
  c:\bin\foo.exe
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that if there *are* no processes called “foo” running, get-process won't just send an empty list (too bad), rather it throws an InvalidOperationException. Here's how you'd normally trap such an exception in PowerShell:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;function restartFoo {
  trap { # this installs an error handler for the function
    continue; # exiting a trap with "continue" says
              # to continue on the next line of the script
  }
  get-process foo | stop-process
  c:\bin\foo.exe
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was pretty much all I needed. It says that if there was any problem with the get-process line of the script, it should just continue on. So if there are no copies of "foo" running (or if stop-process fails for any reason) just skip that part. Pretty dumb error handling logic, but for what I needed in this non-critical script, it seemed as though it would suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well for some reason (and I've still not figured out why - please comment if you know) when get-process throws its exception, it's not trapped by my trap logic. It's definitely not entering the trap block; I added a &lt;strong&gt;"entering trap"&lt;/strong&gt; line to see if it got in there, and it's not. Of course if I stick a &lt;strong&gt;throw "oops"&lt;/strong&gt; statement in there, it enters the trap block just fine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soo, I thought perhaps I would try the more specific version of trap: &lt;strong&gt;trap [ExceptionType] {}&lt;/strong&gt;. But I needed to figure out what type of exception was being thrown, and as Murphy would have it, the class of exception isn't displayed in the error output. So back to the chapter I went, and I found that most cmdlets have an “ea” argument that allows you to control how it behaves in the face of an exception. This turned to be an even easier solution to my problem, but I also learned some other stuff that I'll share here. I also learned about the $error variable, which is an array populated with errors as they occur:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;get-process nosuchprocess -ea SilentlyContinue
$error
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I got from this was a whole laundry list of errors! Apparently the $error object at global scope collects all errors over time. I tried and was able to clear the list, which made things a little easier:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;$error.clear&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I could use the Exception property of the ErrorRecord class, which is the type you'll discover if you pipe $error into the get-member cmdlet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;$error.clear
get-process nosuchprocess -ea SilentlyContinue
$error[0].Exception | get-member&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was how I figured out that the type of exception I was looking for was InvalidOperationException (get-member tells you the type of the object at the beginning of it's output, which is convenient). To make a long story short, I tried trapping that particular error, but control still wasn't transferred to my trap handler. I'm still not sure what's up with that. But here was my final solution (UPDATE - I have a newer one, below):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;function restartFoo {
  $procList = get-process foo -ea SilentlyContinue
  if (!$error) { $procList | stop-process }
  c:\bin\foo.exe
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strike&gt;One thing I learned about $error is that there appears to be a new version of it created in each scope. That is, the $error in my restartFoo function doesn't keep getting bigger over time as the one at global scope does. That makes it easy to test in a function as I've done above (this is how you test for null in PowerShell, as far as I can tell - there is no "null" keyword).&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE (23 Jan, 2007): Looks like the above paragraph is wrong. My function started leaving copies of the process around, and it turned out this was because $error is indeed a single global variable that collects errors over time. I've posted my new solution &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/archive/2007/01/23/45828.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here's what I've got now. It's hard to believe this is the best way to solve this problem. Has anyone come up with anything better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;function restartFoo {
  $oldErrCount = $error.Count
  $procList = get-process foo -ea SilentlyContinue
  if ($error.Count -eq $oldErrCount) { $procList | stop-process }

&lt;p&gt;It really makes me wonder why systems like PowerShell and T-SQL in Sql Server 2005 don't simply leverage the try/catch/finally semantics of a language like Java or C#. Why reinvent the wheel (and do it so badly, in both of these cases)?&lt;/p&gt;

Accidentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, many of the properties from HttpContext are conveniently echoed in the Page class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Page.Request == Page.Context.Request == HttpContext.Current.Request&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Page.Response == Page.Context.Response == HttpContext.Current.Request&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Page.User == Page.Context.User == HttpContext.Current.User&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there's a new property on the page with the same name as a property in the HttpContext. But it's not the same thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Page.Items != Page.Context.Items&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered this by trying to set Items[”foo”] in a page, expecting that I was setting an object in the current context. When I tried to get access to the item via HttpContext.Current.Items, it wasn't there. It took me quite awhile to figure out that Page.Items is a new collection entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still not entirely sure what Page.Items is all about. The documentation says it's used to “store objects with the same lifetime as the page request”, which sure sounds a lot like HttpContext.Items. Why did we need another collection for this? I'm sure I'm missing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IE7 always bypasses proxies for "localhost" addresses. Regardless of configuration. Now when you want to use e.g. Fiddler with a local web app, this can become an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using IIS it's easy, just use the local machine name instead of "localhost" (something I usually do anyways because of SSL). But Cassini doesn't accept machine names - the (quite funny) workaround for that is to use "localhost." (note the dot) instead.

A week or so after installing SP1, I noticed that keyboard input was corrupt, and sure enough SP1 had changed some setting to a foreign keyboard that I didn't have.  So that was the first thing that I checked this time, but the keyboard setting looked correct this time.  So what did SP2 decide to do to me?

He points out that the reason for requiring reservations in the first place (and for securing them with ACLs) is to prevent malware from hiding on an existing port:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The whole reason for ACLs on listen URIs is that malware can't easily open a new listening port – or even trickier – hide behind an already opened port (at least that was my understanding).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenny disagrees, commenting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I think that the main confusion here is around the purpose of http.sys reservations. Reservations are used to prevent squatting. For example, SQL doesn't want other apps, admin or otherwise, to listen on http://+:80/sql/, so they make a reservation with their creds. Reservations are not for preventing malware from listening on your machine. If you have malware on your machine it can just open a socket if it wants to receive data.&lt;/blockquote&gt;If Kenny is correct, then it would seem to me that things would work the other way around: that is, by default you'd be allowed to register with HTTP.SYS unless some other application set up a reservation on that port/prefix. But by default, HTTP.SYS is locked down (except for the holes that Dominick is discussing). Unix set a precedent with this years ago. From section 2.9 of the classic, &lt;em&gt;UNIX Network Programming&lt;/em&gt;: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Unix systems have the concept of a &lt;i&gt;reserved port&lt;/i&gt;, which is any port less than 1024. These ports can only be assigned to a socket by an appropriately privileged process. All the IANA well-known ports (0-1023) are reserved ports; hence the server allocating this port (such as the FTP server) must have superuser privileges when it starts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requiring network services to run with high privilege turned out to be a really bad idea, but the original goal was laudable - don't let just anybody run a well-known service on a server, perhaps spoofing the real service and collecting user passwords, etc. Using URL prefix reservations neatly solves this problem, allowing the administrator to determine who should be listening on various ports, while at the same time allowing those services to run with least privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Squatting on a port is one attack. But it's only one of a myriad of attacks that this reservation system prevents. I cannot imagine that squatting was the only consideration. The port sharing ability of HTTP.SYS makes it even more vulnerable to malware than simply opening a socket. If my exploit can port share with an existing, legitimate service, you might not notice it there if you're using a traditional tool such as netstat. Plus, firewalls are configured to control access to ports - sharing a legitimate port might allow my malware to communicate with the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure malware authors worldwide rejoiced when HTTP.SYS port sharing was introduced. I'd say that concerns like Dominick's are well founded.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I don't work for Microsoft, so take my opinion with a grain of salt 8-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>46660</id><published>2007-04-04T17:05:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-04-04T17:05:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: HTTP.SYS reservations - why do they exist?</title><content type="html">I understand the concerns here.

&lt;br /&gt;Windows Firewall, for example, would prompt the user whether she wanted to "unblock" the application. Any other sort of monitoring tool worth its salt would notice this as well.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Compare this to simply registering as a listener on an existing port via HTTP.SYS. The port is already open as far as the TCP/IP network stack is concerned, so would monitoring software notice this? I don't know.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;You have to ask yourself, why go to the bother of locking something down with an ACL if you're then going to configure it loosely so that the ACL doesn't have any effect.

I'd like to factor out the enveloping code that is the same (everything except "DO SOMETHING WITH RESULT SET").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One way to approach this using traditional OO languages would be to create a class that represented the operation, and have that class call a virtual function that you could override in a derived class. Or, use a function pointer or delegate. In either case, you'd end up splitting off the "DO SOMETHING" part into some other function, which sometimes obscured the block of code you were writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that we have anonymous delegates in C# 2.0, it becomes very natural to abstract this enveloping code: 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;DatabaseHelper.ExecuteSelect("select au_fname, au_lname from authors",
                             delegate(SqlDataReader r) {
    while (r.Read()) {
      Console.WriteLine("{0} {1}", r.GetString(0), r.GetString(1));
    }
  });
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an anonymous delegate like this allows me to write code that almost looks like it's extended C# by adding an “ExecuteSelect“ statement (kind of like the using statement). Here's some simple code that shows how you might accomplish this. Add whatever error handling makes sense for your application, but this demonstrates the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;using System;
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlClient;
using System.Configuration;

public delegate void HandleResultSet(SqlDataReader r);

public static class DatabaseHelper {
    public static void ExecuteSelect(string selectStatement,
                                     HandleResultSet fcn) {
        string connStr =
          ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["pubs"].ConnectionString;
        using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connStr))
        using (SqlCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand()) {
            cmd.CommandText = selectStatement;
            conn.Open();
            using (SqlDataReader r = cmd.ExecuteReader()) {
                fcn(r);
            }
        }
    }
}

class Program {
    static void Main(string[] args) {

        Console.WriteLine("*** Authors ***");
        DatabaseHelper.ExecuteSelect("select au_fname, au_lname from authors",
          delegate(SqlDataReader r) {
            while (r.Read()) {
              Console.WriteLine("{0} {1}", r.GetString(0), r.GetString(1));
            }
          });

        Console.WriteLine("*** Titles ***");
        DatabaseHelper.ExecuteSelect("select title from titles",
          delegate(SqlDataReader r) {
            while (r.Read()) {
              Console.WriteLine(r.GetString(0));
            }
          });
    }
}

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;http://midwestcoders.net/blogs/craig_vermeer/archive/2005/11/14/186.aspx
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I never used it outside of the initial idea and the blog post, so I can't speak to whether it worked all that well in practice.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Once thing that was really nice with anonymous delegates, though, was the fact that the anonymous delegate has access to the local variables of the method in which it is invoked, which helps keep the code cleaner.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;It's nice to see that others had similar ideas, and that it wasn't just me trying to get cute with the language :-)</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="46711"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>46722</id><published>2007-04-11T08:41:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-04-11T08:41:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Enveloped abstractions</title><content type="html">That's right, CraigNotAndera. The capture of local variables makes this technique almost equivalent to extending the language with new statements like "using". I've been using this technique in my code ever since C# 2.0 was released; I'm teaching in Toronto this week and shared the idea with my students, which got me thinking that it would be good fodder for a blog post :-) 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And I agree with &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/" title="Craig Andera, Wangdera"&gt;Craig&lt;/a&gt; that the syntax kinda sucks (the fact that I have to write "delegate" in front of it and enclose it as a parameter to ExecuteSelect makes it a little ugly). Selective use of indentation helps, but I am looking forward to a cleaner syntax.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="46711"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>46715</id><published>2007-04-11T08:06:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-04-11T08:06:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Enveloped abstractions and manageability</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/default.aspx"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/" title="Craig Andera, Wangdera"&gt;Craig&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2007/04/11/46712.aspx"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that my &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/archive/2007/04/11/46711.aspx"&gt;enveloped abstractions&lt;/a&gt; idea might be trickier to maintain than just copying the original enveloped code wherever you need it. I'm a firm believer in DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself), and I'm always on the lookout for repeated code that can be refactored. The technique I described in my post is definitely a bit more advanced than most, and it's not going to be for everyone. But IMHO, if you don't use this, use &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to factor out that common code, such as the &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=F63D1F0A-9877-4A7B-88EC-0426B48DF275&amp;amp;displaylang=en"&gt;Database Application Block&lt;/a&gt; (DAAB) from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing to consider about the anonymous delegate approach is that once you get your head around it (and honestly it's not that tricky, come on Craig ;-) you can tend to focus on what's important, which is the code that's not repeated (the “DO SOMETHING WITH” code). It's like the difference between using try/finally everywhere or the using statement, which gets much of that clutter out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I highly respect Craig's opinion as he's out in the trenches much more often than I am :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>46718</id><published>2007-04-11T08:12:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-04-11T08:12:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Enveloped abstractions and manageability</title><content type="html">I totally agree with you.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;There is an other way though, code generation. I just finished a bunch of wizards for a customer. Partial classes let you very cleanly seperate generated and user code, so it's even pretty easy to rerun your wizard later on.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And to be honest, the table designer stuff that ships with VS doesn't do a bad job either (pretty much our complete data layer is generated using that). The only thing you need to specify is the query/stored proc you want to run.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I know, it is not a good way to run dynamic queries, but from a security standpoint we never do that anyway, right ? ;-)

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But I agree it's a tradeoff. What I see around me currently is that what we perceive as elegant, most developers on my team will view as just plain difficult. That's why I favor code generation for large scale production development work.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;When I design a framework, I'll make darn sure it's elegant though. On the inside ..

I figure it'll reduce the time I waste sorting through it, and help the environment at the same time. Each time I get a catalog that just gets thrown into the trash, instead of throwing it away, I put it in a little pile in my office, and when I need a break from whatever I'm doing, I'll call up the company that prints it and ask them to remove me from their mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I found a way to opt out of many of those pre-approved credit cards. There's a website called &lt;a href="https://www.optoutprescreen.com/"&gt;OptOutPrescreen&lt;/a&gt; that is used by the major credit reporting firms (Equifax, Experian, etc.) in the USA to remove your name from the list they give to companies wanting to send preapproved/prescreened offers of credit or insurance. This website asks for personal information, including your SSN, so instead of filling out the form blindly, I surfed to equifax.com and clicked “Contact Us”, and found a phone number for, “Opt-out of mailing lists”. On that call they referred me to the &lt;a href="https://www.optoutprescreen.com/"&gt;OptOutPrescreen&lt;/a&gt; website as an alternative method of opting out, which made me feel comfortable that the website was legit. The website uses cookies, so be sure to enable them if you want to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose the option to permanently remove my name, which requires you to print out a simple little form, add your signature and date, and mail it in. Here's what the top of the form says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The following is a confirmation of your Opt-Out request. In order to complete your Permanent Opt-Out election, you must print and mail the Permanent Opt-Out Election form. Please &lt;b&gt;click here to print&lt;/b&gt; a confirmation of your Opt-Out request and the Permanent Opt-Out Election form.

&lt;p&gt;In the interim, we will complete a 5 year Opt-Out request on your behalf within 5 business days. We will make your request permanent when we receive your signed Permanent Opt-Out Election form. Although your interim request becomes effective with Equifax, Experian, Innovis and TransUnion within five business days of your request, you may not see an immediate reduction in the amount of offers you receive. This is because your name may have already been provided to some companies that have not yet mailed their offers to you. You may continue to receive certain firm offers for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While your name will be removed from the lists that Equifax, Experian, Innovis and TransUnion provide to businesses for the purpose of making you a firm offer of credit or insurance, you may continue to receive offers from sources that do not use Consumer Credit Reporting Companies to compile their lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you're also interested in lowering the amount of junk mail you get, take a few minutes and do this. We'll see how well it works...&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>47157</id><published>2007-05-02T08:13:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-05-02T08:13:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Opting out</title><content type="html">One thing is that the companies you already have cards with can still pester you.

If you keep a profile for those users, you need a way of linking the incoming claims to the user's profile. When I was first learning about CardSpace and the metasystem, it seemed as though PPIDs were a good answer. But once I learned that PPIDs weren't necessarily stable, I became wary of recommending their use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fact remains true no matter how you define the primary key for users. You need to pay attention to the public key claim when you are accepting personal cards. If you haven't heard about this before, read why &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/10/SecurityBriefs/default.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my suggestion is this: just store the public key in your user profile. I disagree with the approach the Token sample class takes via its UniqueID property - they don't expose the public key directly; instead they have you pick a claim URI that represents your primary key (I guess you're screwed if you wanted a multi-part primary key). Then they hash the value of that “identity“ claim with the public key. Why don't they just expose the public key directly, like WCF with it's System.IdentityModel does? That would allow ME to decide how I'm going to pay attention to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd personally rather just store the public key (or more likely a SHA-256 hash of it) in the user profile. To me, this is clearer than mixing it up with some other claim. Too bad the Token class refuses to give it up directly, and instead insists on hashing it with some other claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: I wrote the code to allow you to access the public key in my &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/archive/2007/05/10/47275.aspx"&gt;next post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>47275</id><published>2007-05-10T11:44:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-05-10T11:44:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Token.IssuerPublicKeyHash</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Updated on 20 May 2007 to fix a bug in the code.&lt;/p&gt;

He has a database with user identity details that must be encrypted (Social Insurance Numbers, other personal data), and he was interested in applying the techniques I presented in &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/01/SecurityBriefs"&gt;Encrypting Without Secrets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then he realized that he needed to also search that data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching is a feature that presupposes the ability to read the data, and if that data is encrypted, searching becomes very difficult, if not impossible. There are techniques you can use to enable searching in some cases, but they all tend to weaken the protection on the encrypted data because they leak information about the cleartext. &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/lcris/archive/2005/12/22/506931.aspx"&gt;Here's a great discussion of the issues&lt;/a&gt; (the context is data encryption and searching in SQL Server 2005, but the ideas can be applied anywhere). Here's a snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's first start by figuring out why we can't directly index the encrypted data and search on it. The encryption algortihms in SQL Server 2005 are salted. By salting, I mean that the encryption algorithms are always using a random initialization vector (IV), which leads to the following property: encrypting twice the same piece of data using the same key will produce two different ciphertexts. The benefit of this is that if in a table we have a column value appearing several times and we encrypt that column, then the fact that the value repeats in the column is no longer apparent by examining the encrypted data. This adds additional protection against the analysis of the ciphertext (encrypted data), but also prevents the ability to search it efficiently. Also note that while the absence of salting would have permited equality searches, range searches would still not be possible as encryption algorithms are not preserving order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how can we perform an equality search given that the encryption is salted and does not permit this? The solution is to add an additional column for holding hashes of the cleartext. The column containing hashes can then be indexed, and searching a piece of sensitive data can be done by first hashing it and then searching the hash value in the new column. This is all nice and easy, but it introduces the threat of a dictionary attack: an attacker could build hashes for as much secret data as he can generate or guess, and then he can verify whether this secret data exists in the table by comparing his hashes with the ones stored in the hash column. This is a significant threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/lcris/default.aspx"&gt;Laurentiu&lt;/a&gt; then goes on to say that you could use a MAC instead of a raw hash. A MAC incorporates a secret into the data before hashing, which prevents an attacker from computing the hash unless he knows the secret. Unfortunately, this solution also requires that the secret be available to the code doing the search, which directly contradicts the main point of my article, which was to separate the secret from the ciphertext.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurentiu makes a point that is good to keep in mind whenever you're considering storing encrypted data: &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Encryption and searching are conflicting objectives&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>47308</id><published>2007-05-12T01:16:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-05-12T01:16:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Searching encrypted data</title><content type="html">Couldnt you keep the secret in SQL Server, as an example, and expose the search functionality via a stored procedure?</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="47301"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>47310</id><published>2007-05-12T05:33:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-05-12T05:33:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Searching encrypted data</title><content type="html">John,
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Yes, all degrees of protection are available. In this particular case, my reader wanted to separate the key from the ciphertext so that if the database were compromised, the attacker would be stuck with ciphertext. Having the decryption key available to the database breaks that countermeasure.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="47301"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>47303</id><published>2007-05-11T14:28:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-05-11T14:28:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">ClaimType.Right</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This property of a claim in System.IdentityModel can be confusing. It's documented as only being able to have the values defined in the Rights class, which are PossessProperty and Identity (I'm not going to write out the full URIs - check the Rights class for those). As of this writing the documentation for &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.identitymodel.claims.claim.right.aspx"&gt;Claim.Right&lt;/a&gt; incorrectly states that Read and Write are also valid values, which makes me curious if there were originally more values in the Rights class than there are now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the beta when I was getting my head around claims-based identity, I didn't pay too much attention to the Right on a claim, because frankly I didn't get it. But as it's currently defined, it does seem pretty straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a WCF service, if you look at a claim dump from a client using Windows creds, you'll see a bunch of SIDs. They are all listed as PossessProperty claims, and the User SID is also copied in the ClaimSet and labeled as an Identity claim. Similarly, if you dump the claims from a cert-based client you'll see the name, public key, and thumbprint from the cert as PossessProperty claims, and then the thumbprint claim is duplicated as an Identity claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the beta, I remember asking &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/mgudgin/default.aspx"&gt;Gudge&lt;/a&gt; in a phone conversation about the difference between PossessProperty and Identity claims, and he seemed to have the same impression as I did at the time: PossessProperty represents something the subject has, and Identity represents something the subject is. Of course that doesn't really help to explain why the thumbprint on a cert is used as an Identity claim! When you've got a bunch of claims describing a client's identity, it seems as though all of them describe something the subject &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. So is-a versus has-a is clearly not precise enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a purely practical standpoint, if you compare the claim dumps I described above, it's pretty clear to me how WCF is using Claim.Right today. It's used to indicate what WCF considers the &lt;em&gt;primary key&lt;/em&gt; of the user's identity. If you think of a row in a database, some of those columns are typically part of the primary key for the table. Correspondingly, I could imagine seeing one or more claims where Claim.Right was set to Identity, and using the values of those claims to index into a record representing the subject of the ClaimSet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case anyone else was confused about what ClaimType.Right really means, I hope that the thread that ensues from this post will help clear up that confusion. I'd also love to hear Microsoft's take on what ClaimType.Right represents, and where we can expect it to be extended in the future. What other Rights is MS considering adding in the future, or is ClaimType.Right relegated to being a boolean field as it appears now?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>47304</id><published>2007-05-11T20:48:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-05-11T20:48:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: ClaimType.Right</title><content type="html">Another way to think about Identity versus PossessProperty is that Identity cannot change over the lifetime of the claimant.

For several months we have turned off editing because of the barrage of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamdexing"&gt;spamdexing&lt;/a&gt; that has included links to anything and everything from online gambling sites to child pornography. We simply couldn't keep up with the bots, and it was getting rather embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get things up and running, we sponsored some of &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/" title="Craig Andera, Wangdera"&gt;Craig&lt;/a&gt;'s time to update &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; (which is an open source product) with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha"&gt;CAPTCHA&lt;/a&gt;. So now when you make changes to a wiki, if you add any links, you'll be required to go through the same validation that you see when you leave a comment on one of our blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should help slow down the attackers enough that we can keep the wikis editable. Also note that if the wiki feels a little slower to use now, it's because caching has been turned off in this version (v2 beta). We'll have caching back on at some point, so bear with us for now.

For example, on our logon page, there will be a button to click to log in using an information card, kind of like what you see on &lt;a href="http://www.identityblog.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-infocard/login/login.php"&gt;Kim's login page&lt;/a&gt;. For people who don't know what an information card is, this might be confusing, so of course we'll want a link that points to some documentation. But right now it seems as though everyone is creating their own descriptions for this. Here's Kim's &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.identityblog.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-infocard/site-messages/infocard-help.php?whatisit"&gt;what is an information card&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; page, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems as though it would help adoption if there were some centralized descriptions of this stuff. Do these pages exist and I'm just missing them? Or is it that Microsoft only wants to talk about CardSpace, which is their implementation of the selector? I note that when Kim wants to tell you how to install an identity selector, he points to a WordPress blog called the &lt;a href="http://pamelaproject.com/"&gt;Pamela Project&lt;/a&gt;, which doesn't seem too helpful, but might be interesting for someone wanting to add support for information cards to their WordPress blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that if the industry really wants consumers to start adopting information cards, somebody's going to have to explain this stuff in terms my mother can understand, and it would help to have a common place where those explanations live.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>47664</id><published>2007-06-05T11:13:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-06-05T11:13:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">End user friendly description of CardSpace for your website</title><content type="html">Keith mentions he cannot find a good end user description of CardSpace that can be used for introducing</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="47661"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>47665</id><published>2007-06-05T09:15:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-06-05T09:15:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Information cards for consumers</title><content type="html">Keith, we do have such a description: see http://blogs.msdn.com/vbertocci/archive/2007/06/05/end-user-friendly-description-of-cardspace-for-your-website.aspx</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="47661"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>47668</id><published>2007-06-05T14:20:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-06-05T14:20:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Information cards for consumers, take two</title><content type="html"></content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="47661"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>47715</id><published>2007-06-11T14:45:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-06-11T14:45:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Information cards for consumers</title><content type="html">Hey Keith.

&lt;br /&gt;Alas, we're in a chicken-and-egg holding pattern right now. Until there are prominent consumer-oriented sites which support informaiton cards, and until organizations start issuing managed cards, there's little point educating general users about CardSpace.

I bet that will spawn a bunch of copywriting around what an information card is and how to use it.

&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn't put sole ownership of writing consumer material on Microsoft though.  As you notied the information card infrastructure is bigger than MS.  That being said, they are one of the better funded companies running with it at the moment.

This person wanted to know if a tutorial existed for this purpose, and mentioned that they weren't very good at C++ programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replacing GINA is a major undertaking, even if you only want to change the look and feel of the logon screen. This is a highly sensitive part of the security system in Windows, and if you screw it up, you can cause the user's system to fail in nasty ways, or worse, allow a bad guy to steal user credentials from those logging in using a vulnerable, modified GINA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if all you want to do is “skin” the GINA so it has a custom logo, perhaps you should take the much, much simpler route of replacing the logon desktop background with one that has your company logo on it. You can do this by changing one registry value, and there's even a &lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/103327"&gt;knowledge base article that explains how to do it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because you can replace GINA doesn't mean you should!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>9</thr:total></entry><entry><id>47692</id><published>2007-06-08T06:38:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-06-08T06:38:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Replacing GINA to add a custom logo?</title><content type="html">I completely agree. In my first development job building software to run on windows 'set-top boxes' that ran multi-media systems for Hotels we replaced GINA to automate the login and deployment of system images using ghost. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;We did it because we couldn't think of a way around it. And it lead to lots and lots of pain. The state of a windows system is very fragile at the level that GINA works. We had some very odds issues with UNICODE support and the GINA module still sends a shiver down my back.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I've also noticed that most people in technology attack a problem space depth first. Many don't even know how to back up and try other options let alone take time to think about how to do something before they start coding.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Also, the need to have a company logo present at login has to be one of the most pointless and irrelevant 'features' I've ever heard...

This was true pre vista, and is true for vista and LH server. while I understand the security implication of allowing arbitrary bitmap on the logon screen and the possible security exposure for credentials, I fail to understand why when building the credential provider model the ms Dev team couldnt allow ISV to brand logonui. and on the corporate front, allowing a GPO that would change the backround for the logon screen or show a fixed size bitmap on some end of the screen. that would allowed only corperate customers to centraly control that feature , which would have served both the obvious common branding need and the security risk.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Alas, we're in a chicken-and-egg holding pattern right now. Until there are prominent consumer-oriented sites which support informaiton cards, and until organizations start issuing managed cards, there's little point educating general users about CardSpace. It'd be like issuing drivers licenses before cards and roads are built.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, somebody (Microsoft?) needs to break this holding pattern fast. I agree that things aren't going to take off until there are more relying parties. But as a guy who is busy doing just that (adding support for infocard to pluralsight.com), it doesn't make me feel very comfortable that &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/archive/2007/06/05/47661.aspx"&gt;those consumer landing pages I talked about in my post&lt;/a&gt; don't already exist on the web.

It's a few weeks away, so &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/AppliedDotNet3.aspx"&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt; today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really excited about this class, as we've completely reworked our Workflow and security discussions, which of course are my specialty. We have close to an entire day dedicated to the claims-based authentication and authorization story that is going to be so important going forward for both information cards and federated identity scenarios. You'll get hands-on experience building web services and ASP.NET applications that use claims to authorize access to resources. You'll also learn about claims transformation, see &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/11/SingleSignOn/default.aspx"&gt;ADFS&lt;/a&gt; in action, and learn about the important role that &lt;a href="http://sts.labs.live.com/"&gt;security token services&lt;/a&gt; (STS) play.&lt;/p&gt;

He said that he found some advice in the patterns &amp;amp; practices guidelines (&lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms998297.aspx"&gt;How To: Create a Service Account for an ASP.NET 2.0 Application&lt;/a&gt;) that seemed to indicate that it would be OK to use the Network Service account in production Here was my response to him - I thought other readers might be interested in this, and I'm sure some of you may have comments to expand on this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easier to use network service, because it can use the SPN of the machine, which is already set up. There are some drawbacks, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is that the more stuff you run as Network Service (NS), the more privilege it starts to gain. For example, if one of the OS services that runs as NS is compromised by a remote attacker, the attacker now has credentials to read your SQL Server database (if that's also running as NS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principal of least privilege would dictate that each service have its own account, to isolate the resources that the service needs so that other services can't use those resources without explicitly being granted access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another drawback is that on the network, NS is represented using the machine account SID. This SID changes anytime you repave the machine (perhaps there's a way to reset it back, but I've not explored this). So while adding machines to groups is possible for authorization purposes, it can get messy if the machine SID changes (you'll need to update all of those group memberships). This problem doesn't exist for a user account.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>48242</id><published>2007-08-16T12:54:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-08-16T12:54:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Should I run stuff as network service in production?</title><content type="html">The SQL Books Online specifically recommends *not* using the network service account to run SQL Server.

I used to use the &lt;a href="http://www.hamiltonlabs.com/"&gt;Hamilton C Shell&lt;/a&gt;, which was powerful and integrates exceptionally well with Windows, but I found myself constantly having to relearn the script syntax whenever I'd want to do something. So when &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/download.mspx"&gt;PowerShell&lt;/a&gt; came along, I bought &lt;a href="http://www.bookpool.com/sm/1932394907"&gt;Bruce's book&lt;/a&gt; and went to town with it. There are so many things I love about PowerShell that it'll take many blog entries to cover them all. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the problems I solved that I've had on my list of "blog topics" for ages was how to set ACLs on files using PowerShell. Below is a *very* basic script that will get you started. This grants a user named "keith" permission to modify a file called "foo.txt" in the current directory. It's the simplest example I can think of that demonstrates the idea. I'll explore this in future posts and eventually translate it into a more universal script that you can use in production, but this should get you thinking! 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;$dacl = (dir foo.txt).GetAccessControl()&lt;br /&gt;$newRule = New-Object Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule "keith",&lt;br /&gt;Modify, Allow&lt;br /&gt;$modified = $false&lt;br /&gt;$dacl.ModifyAccessRule("Add", $newRule, [ref]$modified)&lt;br /&gt;(dir foo.txt).SetAccessControl($dacl)&lt;/p&gt;

There are a number of fine points about PowerShell syntax and Windows security concepts that this little script relies upon, and I'm going to walk through them a little bit at a time so that you really grok what this script does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take the first line of the script today: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;$dacl = (dir foo.txt).GetAccessControl()&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that happens here, is that the dir command runs with an argument of "foo.txt". Dir is actually mapped onto a PowerShell cmdlet. You can discover this mapping via the ALIAS command in PowerShell:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;$ alias dir | format-table -autosize

CommandType Name Definition
----------- ---- ----------
Alias       dir  Get-ChildItem
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we're using the file system, Get-ChildItem returns a stream of .NET objects representing files or directories, and in our case, we get a FileInfo object back. If you're ever curious what type of object a PowerShell command returns, you can pipe its output to the Get-Member cmdlet: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;$ dir foo.txt | Get-Member

   TypeName: System.IO.FileInfo

...&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've elided the rest of the output from Get-Member, which conveniently lists all of the methods, properties, etc. for FileInfo. This is currently the closest you'll get to IntelliSense in PowerShell :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dir foo.txt returns a FileInfo instance. If you look at the docs for System.IO.FileInfo, you'll see that it has a method called GetAccessControl(), and we are calling that method to access the &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.GuideBook/WhatIsASecurityDescriptor.html"&gt;security descriptor&lt;/a&gt; for the file. Here's that line of code again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;$dacl = (dir foo.txt).GetAccessControl()&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I should technically call the variable $securityDescriptor, or perhaps $sd because a security descriptor has much more in it than a &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.GuideBook/WhatIsAnAccessControlList.html"&gt;DACL&lt;/a&gt;. With the security descriptor  you can also mess around with the &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.GuideBook/WhatIsOwnership.html"&gt;owner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.GuideBook/WhatIsAnAccessControlList.html"&gt;SACL&lt;/a&gt;, but that's fairly rare compared to mucking with an object's DACL, where you can control who can do what to your object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a way to get at the access control list, we can use some cool new (well not so new anymore) functionality in .NET 2.0 (System.Security.AccessControl, baby!) to modify the DACL. In my &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/archive/2007/10/31/48903.aspx"&gt;next post&lt;/a&gt;, I'll talk about how we do that, along with more PowerShell syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

Today I'll show you how to tweak that ACL using System.Security.AccessControl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;$newRule = New-Object Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule "keith", Modify, Allow&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This next line of code in my example creates an "access rule". This is a lot like an Access Control Entry (ACE) in the Win32 API, if you happen to be familiar with that. A rule has several parts that describe a permission that you want to grant or deny:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an IdentityReference (the user/group you're talking about) 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;an AccessMask (a bitmask describing which permissions you're talking about) 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a flag that indicates whether this is a grant or a denial of the permissions 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a set of flags that determine how this rule should be inherited by child items&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note how I created this object in PowerShell. The New-Object cmdlet allows you to specify a .NET type that you want to instantiate. In this case, I'm creating an instance of System.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule, although I've saved some space by omitting "System." since PowerShell searches that namespace by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the type name is an array that contains the ctor arguments. Constructing an access rule is pretty easy since you can pass strings that represent the user or group accounts, and the framework will happily look up the &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.GuideBook/WhatIsASID.html"&gt;Security Identifier (SID)&lt;/a&gt; on your behalf. Little features like this are one reason working with System.Security.AccessControl is so much more pleasant than the underlying Win32 interface! Note that here I'm just using the account name, "Keith", but I could have been more specific and used the fully-qualified MACHINE\ACCOUNT or DOMAIN\ACCOUNT syntax, such as, "MyDomain\Keith". And in practice I'd be using a group instead of an individual user to grant permissions (for this example I decided to stick with something really concrete and easy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second and third ctor arguments show off one of my favorite features of PowerShell. I hate typing any more than I have to, and it's great to have context-sensitive evaluation of enumerations like this. By simply passing in the symbol, Modify, PowerShell knows that I mean FileSystemRights.Modify. The same goes for AccessControlType.Allow. This can make your code more readable than even the equivalent C# code because it eliminates so much clutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll have more to say about enumerations and PowerShell in my &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/archive/2007/11/29/49320.aspx"&gt;next post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

And at TechEd Barcelona, &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vbertocci/"&gt;Vittorio&lt;/a&gt; showed a &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vbertocci/archive/2007/11/18/adfs-2-teched-breakout-session-wrapup.aspx"&gt;sneak preview&lt;/a&gt; of what he calls the &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vbertocci/archive/2007/11/19/developing-a-minimal-sts-with-adfs-2-identity-framework-part-i-the-sts-itself.aspx"&gt;ADFS 2 Identity Framework&lt;/a&gt;, where you can get started building an STS simply by deriving from a base class that represents the STS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wonder if this framework will support &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/card/archive/2007/11/22/cardspace-support-for-oasis-ws-sx-standards.aspx"&gt;WS-SX from OASIS&lt;/a&gt;?

One of the premises of Information Cards are the &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2006/07/7Laws/default.aspx"&gt;seven laws&lt;/a&gt;, and the first law implies that the user should be able to see the information being disclosed about her identity. This needs to hold true even when the security token is being issued by a third party, which is the case in managed card scenarios.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This question comes up a lot: "Because the claims in the security token may be encrypted so that only the RP can read them, how can the subject's identity selector (CardSpace, for example) show the values of these claims to the user?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The way we get around this is through something called a "Display Token". The idea is that the security token is ultimately a communication between the identity provider (IdP) and the relying party (RP). Indeed the subject's identity selector may not even understand the token format given that Information Cards can use a variety of token formats to communicate claims. So the display token is specifically crafted for the IdP to show the subject what claims are being sent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The obvious follow up question is, "How can we be certain that the claims in the display token accurately reflect what's in the security token?" The identity selector has no way of validating this. The subject must ultimately trust her IdP not to lie to her, just as she must trust the IdP not to allow other users to impersonate her. This is a big reason why the fifth law exists. There are multiple identity providers, and you should choose one that you trust given the context in which you want to use it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those who want to know more about how display tokens work, &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vbertocci/default.aspx"&gt;Vittorio&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vbertocci/archive/2007/10/31/on-displaytoken.aspx"&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; has some great pictures and further details.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>49314</id><published>2007-11-28T09:20:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-11-28T09:20:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Google's online storage solution</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Looks like Google is &lt;a href="http://computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;amp;taxonomyName=security&amp;amp;articleId=9049220&amp;amp;taxonomyId=17&amp;amp;intsrc=kc_top"&gt;jumping into the fray&lt;/a&gt;, surprisingly late in the game. &lt;a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3"&gt;Amazon S3&lt;/a&gt; has been around for a year already, and Microsoft already has a beta of &lt;a href="http://skydrive.live.com/"&gt;Windows Live Skydrive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The online storage subscription-based service may be ready for release early next year, according to the report.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;$newRule = New-Object Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule "keith", Modify, Allow&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pointed out how the "Modify" was automatically converted into an enumeration value, promising that I'd talk more about enumerations later. Well, this value comes from the System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemRights enumeration. And there's a cool way you can abuse PowerShell to get a quick and dirty listing of an enumeration's values. But to understand how it works, you'll have to bear with me and learn about type-constrained variables in PowerShell, which is a really cool feature unto itself, and one that I use all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While PowerShell doesn't support strong typing in the classic sense of a compiler, it does have a feature that allows you to constrain the type of a variable whenever it's assigned a value. Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;$a = 42
[Int32] $b = 42
$a = "this works just fine"
$b = "this generates an invalid cast exception"
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This syntax allows you to create type-constrained variables. Now when I assign an object to $b, PowerShell will first try to cast that object to System.Int32 (you could also have used "int", by the way). The last line of code above will throw an invalid cast exception. This is a very useful feature, allowing you to get some helpful type checking in your scripts. But this feature also has a nifty side effect that Bruce describes in his &lt;a href="http://www.bookpool.com/sm/1932394907"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;. You can use this to get a quick listing of enumeration values:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;$ [Security.AccessControl.FileSystemRights] "foo"
Cannot convert value "foo" to type "System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemRights"
due to invalid enumeration values. Specify one of the following enumeration values
and try again. The possible enumeration values are "ListDirectory, ReadData,
WriteData, CreateFiles, CreateDirectories, AppendData, ReadExtendedAttributes,
WriteExtendedAttributes, Traverse, ExecuteFile, DeleteSubdirectoriesAndFiles,
ReadAttributes, WriteAttributes, Write, Delete, ReadPermissions, Read,
ReadAndExecute, Modify, ChangePermissions, TakeOwnership, Synchronize, FullControl"
At line:1 char:42
+ [Security.AccessControl.FileSystemRights]  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; "foo"
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more!&lt;/p&gt;

What I wanted was something like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;%WINDIR%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet_regiis.exe -r&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In PowerShell, an easy way to get the value of an environment variable is to use the $env namespace like so:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;$env:windir&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;but when I put this all together and tried to run it, PowerShell didn't parse it the way I expected:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;tt&gt;$env:windir\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet_regiis.exe -r&lt;br /&gt;Unexpected token '\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet_regiis.exe' in expression or statement.&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Putting quotes around it doesn't help. Now PowerShell assumes you want a string.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;tt&gt;"$env:windir\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet_regiis.exe" -r&lt;br /&gt;You must provide a value expression on the right-hand side of the '-' operator.&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;What you need to do is make it clear to PowerShell that you want to execute the next string as a command. The way to do this is to use the call operator &amp;amp; (ampersand). Here's what I ended up with:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp; $env:windir\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet_regiis.exe -r&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's more like it. This is the sort of little roadblock that tends to frustrate people trying to use PowerShell for the first time. I hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>148</thr:total></entry><entry><id>49338</id><published>2007-12-02T15:57:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-12-02T15:57:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Execute in PowerShell</title><content type="html">Oh, this one is funny.  Whoever designed and/or implemented that part of PowerShell's parser could teach something to the Visual C++ department.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In the ISO standards for C and C++, when preprocessing tokens don't convert correctly to ordinary tokens, conforming implementations are required to issue diagnostics.  Conforming implementations are allowed to do whatever else they wish, so for example Visual C++ can paste two preprocessing tokens into one ordinary token in order to create a translation unit good enough for further translation, but they're not allowed to forget about diagnostics while doing so.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So here, PowerShell knows how to avoid pasting two tokens together.  Or more importantly, they know how to issue an error message.  Visual Studio needs to hire them.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="49336"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>49493</id><published>2007-12-20T06:12:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-12-20T06:12:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Execute in PowerShell</title><content type="html">Thank you Keith!  You are absolutly right about things like this being frustrating.  I realize it's hard for the creators and power users of Powershell (mostly developers) to understand what newbs like me are going through...  We want to learn Powershell, but stuff like this can sure slow us up and discourage us.

you're thinking about the security of a web server, it's a good idea to think about the worst case scenario.

A disaster recovery plan is an important security feature, and it's one that you need to practice to get right. Do you have scripts in place that will reinstall your web applications as soon as the sysadmin plugs in a new box with a fresh, blank, patched OS?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I happen to be using PowerShell to build some of this out for Pluralsight, and hey, like most of us, &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/archive/2007/12/02/49336.aspx"&gt;I'm still learning it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>49341</id><published>2007-12-03T16:37:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-12-03T16:37:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Cracking passwords on a PlayStation</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I remember making a joke not long ago about my kid sister attacking a password database using her Nintendo DS. Looks like the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7118997.stm"&gt;PS3 has an architecture that makes it especially well suited for this type of attack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Security researcher Nick Breese used a PS3 to crack supposedly strong eight-character passwords in hours. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Typically, previous attempts to crack such passwords took days to get the same result.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I found this story via &lt;a href="http://www.identityblog.com/?p=915"&gt;Kim's blog&lt;/a&gt;, where he points out that using password-based encryption is dangerous. What he's referring to is using encryption where the key is derived from a password.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lots of consumer-oriented encryption works this way. For example, when you encrypt a ZIP file with a password, clearly the password is being used to derive a key. Let's say this resulted in a 256-bit AES key. Don't fool yourself - your keyspace is not 256 bits! If you used a 12 character password, it's only a 79-bit keyspace. And that's the best case, assuming you included numbers, punctuation characters, as well as upper and lower-case letters, and generated it from a good random source. If you only used numbers, you'd end up with a whopping 40-bit keyspace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dynamic-cast.com/"&gt;Hervey&lt;/a&gt; and I worked on an &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/archive/2005/02/01/5526.aspx"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; awhile back that addressed this issue, in case you want more background information. The moral of the story is, if you're forced to use passwords to authenticate users, it's a good idea to tunnel this over a stronger form of encryption (SSL is a very common example).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>49343</id><published>2007-12-03T09:03:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-12-03T09:03:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">PrincipalPermissionAttribute and Static ctor Leads to DoS</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently heard a colleague lamenting that he was having difficulty using PrincipalPermissionAttribute at the class level in a certain scenario under WCF. I &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.GuideBook.HowToTrackClientIdentityUsingThreadDotCurrentPrincipal"&gt;recommended caution&lt;/a&gt; in my &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.GuideBook.HomePage"&gt;guidebook&lt;/a&gt;, because of the nasty type load exception that you can run into if the first request to the class is denied by the attribute.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be careful about using this attribute at the class level. If the class to which you apply it happens to have a static constructor (or, even worse, if it may get one in the future), realize that this attribute applies to the static constructor as well! Why is this a problem? Well, if a static constructor throws an exception, the class is latched into a mode where each future attempt to call the static constructor leads to the previous exception being rethrown (&lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cbrumme/archive/2003/04/15/51348.aspx"&gt;Brumme, 2003&lt;/a&gt;). So, if the first caller to use the class doesn't satisfy the permission demand, no callers in the entire AppDomain will be able to use that class!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here's a simple console app you can compile that demonstrates the danger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="1" face="Courier New"&gt;using System;&lt;br /&gt;using System.Security.Principal;&lt;br /&gt;using System.Security.Permissions;&lt;br /&gt;using System.Threading; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="1" face="Courier New"&gt;[PrincipalPermission(SecurityAction.Demand, Role="SuperUser")]&lt;br /&gt;class Sensitive {&lt;br /&gt;    static Sensitive() {&lt;br /&gt;        Console.WriteLine("Inside static constructor");&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;} &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="1" face="Courier New"&gt;class Program {&lt;br /&gt;    static void Main(string[] args) {&lt;br /&gt;        becomeSuperUser();&lt;br /&gt;        tryUsingSensitiveClass();&lt;br /&gt;        becomeNormalUser();&lt;br /&gt;        tryUsingSensitiveClass();&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;    static void tryUsingSensitiveClass() {&lt;br /&gt;        try {&lt;br /&gt;            new Sensitive();&lt;br /&gt;            Console.WriteLine("{0} OK!!",&lt;br /&gt;                Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity.Name);&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        catch (Exception x) {&lt;br /&gt;            Console.WriteLine(&lt;br /&gt;                "{0} failed due to a {1}",&lt;br /&gt;                Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity.Name,&lt;br /&gt;                x.GetType().Name);&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;    static void becomeNormalUser() {&lt;br /&gt;        Thread.CurrentPrincipal = new GenericPrincipal(&lt;br /&gt;            new GenericIdentity("Bob"), null);&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;    static void becomeSuperUser() {&lt;br /&gt;        string[] roles = { "SuperUser" };&lt;br /&gt;        Thread.CurrentPrincipal = new GenericPrincipal(&lt;br /&gt;            new GenericIdentity("Alice"), roles);&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here's the output of the above program, exactly as written. Notice that the call order is such that the privileged user accesses the protected class first, so things work as you'd expect:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;Inside static constructor&lt;br /&gt;Alice OK!!&lt;br /&gt;Bob failed due to a SecurityException&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here's the output when I switch the order and have the normal user try to use the class first. The type is locked down and after that, even privileged users can't access it:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;Bob failed due to a TypeInitializationException&lt;br /&gt;Alice failed due to a TypeInitializationException&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you remove the static ctor, things work as expected:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Courier New"&gt;Bob failed due to a SecurityException&lt;br /&gt;Alice OK!!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Does this mean that you should never use PrincipalPermissionAttribute on a class? Maybe not, but you should probably put a comment on the class warning future devs to avoid adding a static ctor on it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>49349</id><published>2007-12-04T08:56:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-12-04T08:56:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Supporting Complex Passwords</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's ironic that only yesterday I posted about the dangers of using passwords for encryption. Well this morning another "feature" of passwords hit me square in the forehead. I tried to activate &lt;a href="http://onecare.live.com"&gt;Windows Live OneCare&lt;/a&gt; (I've decided to give their &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://fss.live.com/"&gt;family safety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; feature a try to limit where my little ones can surf on the net). Here's what I got when I supplied my Windows Live ID and password (please note I've changed my ID in this picture to protect the innocent, well, me):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/images/blogged/onecare_and_passwords.jpg" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you can see, I have a strong (or at least a long) password. After spending about 15 minutes searching for a solution, I came across &lt;a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/WindowsOneCare/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=2461028&amp;amp;SiteID=2"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, which indicates that Windows Live OneCare Activation has problems with complex passwords. The solution? Go reset your password so that it uses only numbers and letters and is &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/archive/2007/12/03/49341.aspx"&gt;8 characters or less&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One possibility is that the password for your LiveID is complex - meaning longer than 8 characters and composed of characters other than just letters and numbers. The activation system has reportedly had issues with this in the past. If that is the case for your ID, you may want to consider changing the password temporarily to see if it allows you to activate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm sure you've seen this before. Many systems out there that deal with passwords assume that users will supply short, simple passwords, not randomly generated, strong passwords created by a tool. Or long pass phrases. But this is especially egregious since it encourages people to reduce the strength of the password that controls access to many different Microsoft properties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't have time to try to figure out exactly what this dialog is choking on, but when it chokes it happens so quickly that my guess is that some internal validation on the password is causing it to fail. It doesn't appear to be making a round-trip to Windows Live ID in order to validate the email or password. I temporarily changed my password to 7 character alpha-only, and it worked fine. And yes, I later reset my password to a random strong one that I store in &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/tools.aspx"&gt;Password Minder&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a lesson from this flawed implementation. Always, always assume that your users will supply long, random, passwords. Or even better, allow the user to supply a &lt;a href="http://netfx3.com/content/WindowsCardspaceHome.aspx"&gt;stronger form of authn&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>49352</id><published>2007-12-04T21:12:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-12-04T21:12:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Supporting Complex Passwords</title><content type="html">Security:  Microsoft sometimes gets it.

Based on what he's shown and his descriptions, I've put together a little list of some features we can probably expect from the Fx. This is all pre-alpha stuff and the API will probably change, but the core features being shown will probably be similar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are a rather concise set notes that I've taken while looking over his code more closely. I created a &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith/IdentityFrameworkProbableFeatureList.html"&gt;wiki page&lt;/a&gt; to quickly hack up this list. Here's what it looks like now:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fx helps you implement a custom STS  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;STS can issue managed cards (see below)  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fx provides a base class for your STS, (it's currently called SecurityTokenService)  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You derive from this base class and supply a "ScopeProvider" implementation which answers (at least) two questions:  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;What type of claims your STS can issue (you have to generate a list of claim URIs that you will be issuing)  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;This is helpful for issuing managed cards, which need to specify which claims an IdP supplies &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What claims should be issued for a given user request, which consists of:  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Information about the target relying party (AppliesTo), which is not always known (an auditing STS will know this, for example)  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The AuthorizationContext for the user requesting the token (this gives you the incoming set of claims from the user)  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The actual RST if you want to look at it (this is a WS-Trust thing)  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The issuer's credentials (you need this to generate the claim set) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;User authentication methods (an STS needs to authenticate the user before issuing a token)  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Kerberos  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;X509 Certificates  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SAML from personal cards  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Username/Password &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fx helps you expose your STS using WCF  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fx supplies a custom ServiceHostFactory (currently called WindowsInformationCardServiceHostFactory)  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This allows you to create a .SVC file for a WCF endpoint to expose your STS &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fx supplies an HttpModule for the traditional ASP.NET authentiation pipeline  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;According to Vittorio, this "automates a lot of the validation work in the framework". It's called FederatedAuthenticationModule, which gives a hint as to its function. It probably sets up HttpContext.User like a traditional authn module would. It's probably not specific to building an STS (remember the Fx is also used to build relying parties)  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a custom config section that configures this module. Vittorio uses it to say, "use my SSL cert as my relying party cert". This is probably required in case the client wants to authenticate using a card. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Issuing managed cards  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fx provides a function to generate a managed card, as well as a class that represents it (it's currently called InformationCard)  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;You can specify the default name and image for the card you issue, controlling what the client sees when she installs your card  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fx provides an information card serializer: InformationCard&amp;lt;--&amp;gt;XML (this is what the user installs into her identity selector - an XML representation of the card) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fx provides a utility to generate a PPID, which is a pretty complicated task!  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Currently takes three inputs to gen a PPID for the relying party to use:  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Client's AuthorizationContext  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The relying party (AppliesTo)  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Issuer's credentials &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fx provides some helpers for reading claims from an AuthorizationContext  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;I notice a ClaimsContext class that allows you to write code like I show below, although I'm not sure how it figures out how it deals with multiple ClaimSets. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;string email = myClaimsContext[ClaimTypes.Email]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fx provides a set of ASP.NET login controls (three right now): 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FederatedPassiveSignIn (I'm guessing this is for doing traditional ADFS v1 style logons) 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;InformationCard (login control that accepts information cards) 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SignInStatus (probably similar features to ASP.NET's LoginStatus) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fx helps you build relying parties 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;InformationCard login control 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can specify whether you want to accept personal or managed cards 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you accept managed cards, a wizard will take a card file as input to automatically configure the control (great idea, guys!) 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wizard shows claims supported by the managed card, and you can select which ones you want (either optionally or required) 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There appears to be a SignInMode that you can use to establish a session. I'm guessing that this issues an ASP.NET Forms logon cookie or something equivalent. This is probably one of the things that the HttpModule deals with (reading that cookie and using it to configure HttpContext.User). 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here are the control's identity-related events: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SecurityTokenReceived 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SecurityTokenValidated 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SignedIn 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SignInError &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's a picture Vittorio shows that shows a number of the properties of the control if you want to try to guess more about what it's going to do: &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

I'm finding it so intuitive to navigate, and just plain fun to use. The other day I was trying to build something that behaved similarly to an ASP.NET repeater control. I wanted to use a data template to specify the presentation of each item, and I wanted the list of items to be presented using a WrapPanel. Pretty simple, you'd think!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the result of my efforts looked like stretched silly putty, I figured that I must have taken the wrong approach, so I hooked up with the author of our &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/AppliedWPF.aspx"&gt;WPF short course&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/ian.aspx"&gt;Ian Griffiths&lt;/a&gt;. Ian reminded me about constraints in layout, and I was able to fix my problem pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unless you use absolute positioning (such as the Canvas layout control does), WPF uses a pretty sophisticated negotiation model to figure out how each control will be laid out. WrapPanel, for example, asks each child element how much space it wants, and lays those children out in a wrapped fashion. Here's a simple example with two buttons:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td width="400" valign="top"&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;WrapPanel&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;Button&amp;gt;One&amp;lt;/Button&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;Button&amp;gt;Two&amp;lt;/Button&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/WrapPanel&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td width="75" valign="center"&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/images/blogged/wpf-layout/two-buttons.jpg" /&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the above case, the WrapPanel asks its children how much space they want. The buttons size themselves according to their content (in the example above, the text in each button determines its size). So there's no problem. But try dropping a simple Image into the same panel and things start to get weird:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td width="400" valign="top"&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;WrapPanel&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;Button&amp;gt;One&amp;lt;/Button&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;Image Source="..."/&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/WrapPanel&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td width="75" valign="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/images/blogged/wpf-layout/button-with-image-unconstrained.jpg" /&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt;You see, by default, Image stretches to fill the available space in the container. But the WrapPanel isn't constraining the child's space, and so things get strange. Either the parent or the child in this case needs to step up and figure out how much space should be allotted for the child. One easy way to fix this is to turn off stretching in the Image element:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td width="400" valign="top"&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;WrapPanel&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;Button&amp;gt;One&amp;lt;/Button&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;tt&gt;  &amp;lt;Image Source="..." Stretch="None"/&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;lt;/WrapPanel&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td width="75" valign="center"&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/images/blogged/wpf-layout/button-with-image-constrained.jpg" /&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now I've got something more reasonable - the little XML image is the size I expected it to be. Image is an example of a control that can wreak havoc with the layout engine if you're not aware of this. ScrollViewer is an example of a container that can do the same thing, as it essentially tells its children they have infinite space. So if you run into weirdness like this, take some time to adjust various constraints until you find a solution you like!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>36</thr:total></entry><entry><id>75661</id><published>2010-03-27T03:22:58.0-05:00</published><updated>2010-03-27T03:22:58.0-05:00</updated><category

type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/archive/2007/11/29/49320.aspx"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; in this series, I showed how easy it is to work with enumerations in PowerShell. Here's the code I've been walking through in this series:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;$dacl = (dir foo.txt).GetAccessControl()&lt;br /&gt;$newRule = New-Object Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule "keith", Modify, Allow&lt;br /&gt;$modified = $false&lt;br /&gt;$dacl.ModifyAccessRule("Add", $newRule, [ref]$modified)&lt;br /&gt;(dir foo.txt).SetAccessControl($dacl)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All I've got left to explain is the last line of code. It's important to note that when you're tweaking ACLs, there are basically three steps you have to take:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Read the ACL from an object.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tweak it however you like.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write the ACL back to the object.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this last line of code, I'm applying the new, tweaked ACL back to the file foo.txt. At this point the new access control policy takes effect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Navigate posts in this series: &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/archive/2007/11/29/49320.aspx"&gt;prev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>49856</id><published>2008-01-09T05:37:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-01-09T05:37:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Authorization vs. Business Logic</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years the software industry has been figuring out better ways of solving security problems. One of the remaining conundrums has been figuring out where to put authorization logic. When you start thinking about this, you often end up in a big gray area: where does the "authorization" end and the "business logic" in your method begin? If there were some obvious distinction between the two, you could easily factor out the authorization logic and perhaps even centralize it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the authorization logic is simple, perhaps you have to be a member of some group or have some claim in order to be able to call a method, then it's easy to factor out that type of logic. This is what WCF's &lt;a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.serviceauthorizationmanager.aspx"&gt;ServiceAuthorizationManager&lt;/a&gt; is all about, for example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it's not always that easy, is it? What if you want the outcome of the method to be slightly different depending on the user's security context? Perhaps you're going to use the value of some claim to customize the output, or limit your actions somewhat depending on that context? I've often argued that it's an oversimplification to say that you can factor out all authorization logic from a method, and it looks like &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vbertocci/archive/2007/12/21/the-authorization-continuum.aspx"&gt;Vittorio agrees with me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>49871</id><published>2008-01-10T07:37:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-01-10T07:37:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Windows Live OneCare Firewall and Software</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've recently installed Windows Live OneCare and generally have been very happy with it. I'm using the Family Safety option to help my kids access the Internet safely. But one thing that's been bugging me is the outbound firewall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your software is signed with a code signing cert issued by an authority that is trusted on the machine (e.g., Thawte, Verisign, etc.) you're good, because the firewall will automatically allow your software to access the Internet. But if you don't want to shell out the hundreds of $$$ it takes to get one of these certs, especially for homebrew software, you might try to do what I did and tell the OneCare firewall about your app. Under Advanced Settings, you can point at your EXE file and tell the firewall to allow it to make outbound connections. Sadly this doesn't seem to work very consistently. Here's a sample program that I could sometimes get this to work for, and sometimes not:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;tt&gt; &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;using System;&lt;br /&gt;using System.Net;  &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;class FetchMicrosoftHomePage {&lt;br /&gt;    static void Main() {&lt;br /&gt;        byte[] data;&lt;br /&gt;        try {&lt;br /&gt;            data = new WebClient().DownloadData("&lt;a _="_" href="http://www.microsoft.com"&gt;http://www.microsoft.com");&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;            Console.WriteLine("Microsoft's home page is {0} bytes long", data.Length);&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        catch (WebException x) {&lt;br /&gt;            Console.WriteLine(x);&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;} &lt;/tt&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've spent about an hour trying to figure out why I can only sporadically get the firewall to recognize this program, and I'm done now. FWIW, when it's not recognized, the firewall outputs a log message like this (you need to turn on detailed logging to see this, BTW):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/keith/images/blogged/onecare_and_unknown_outbound_apps.jpg" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There's a lot of people who will argue that an outbound firewall is useless, especially for non-techies. And a lot of people will argue the opposite point. I'm not here to argue either of these points, but I can say that this type of behavior makes it pretty hard for even highly technical people to use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since I'm personally in the, "outbound firewalls aren't that useful" camp, I fixed the problem on my own machine by adding four rules that allow all outbound TCP and UDP connections to all ports (I figured I needed four, since each rule only allows one protocol and you have to pick between local subnet vs. Internet). Then I shut off the prompts for "blocking" programs and everything seems to be working fine. But I wonder how many software developers will be running into deployment problems in home environments where lots of users are running this firewall.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>37</thr:total></entry><entry><id>49936</id><published>2008-01-16T04:58:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-01-16T04:58:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Windows Live OneCare Firewall and Software</title><content type="html">Keith--

&lt;br /&gt;Just want to disabuse the notion that code signing is in the hundreds of $$$ realm. John Robbins recently posted about getting a code signing cert for $80/year. http://www.wintellect.com/cs/blogs/jrobbins/archive/2007/12/21/code-signing-it-s-cheaper-and-easier-than-you-thought.aspx
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Still not free, but it's not a killer cost either.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I can get a code signing certificate for free by issuing it myself. But you need more than a code signing certificate - you need one that was signed by a CA that's trusted by all of your customers.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;A quick scan of the blog entry you mentioned shows that Jon had to explicitly install Comodo's CA certificate into his trusted root store:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;"I had some trouble with registration process at Comodo. Make sure you add https://secure.comodo.net to the list of trusted sites in Internet Explorer so they can properly get you registered and install their trusted root certificate on your computer"
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;That's not an operation your setup application should be performing on a customer's machine, IMHO.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So I'm not sure I buy Jon's argument that code signing is cheaper than you thought. If I'm going to sign stuff for my own personal use, I'll use a cert that I issue, and it'll be free. But if I'm building commercial software that will be installed on other people's machines (who don't necessarily trust me), I'll stick with VeriSign, Thawte, and friends, since my customers already trust those CAs.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;A personal rant on the bigger picture: code signing is ultimately pretty silly. Does my mom really "trust" VeriSign? Would she really care if I installed my own self-issued CA's cert in her trusted store? Would she have a clue what that meant if she were warned about it? Frankly the whole business seems ludicrous to me because the user ultimately has to decide what she trusts and what she does not. IMHO, all code signing does at the moment is keep VeriSign in business. End rant.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to

href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2008/01/10/49874.aspx"&gt;FlexWiki 2.0 shipped yesterday!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/"&gt;Craig&lt;/a&gt; has been instrumental in making &lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com/"&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/a&gt; what it is today. He's donated a lot of time and effort to the project (I know this, because many of the features he added were ones that I requested). Now that he's &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2008/01/10/49875.aspx"&gt;leaving the project&lt;/a&gt;, hopefully he'll have more time to spend with his family. We're certainly doing our best to keep him busy here at &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/default.aspx"&gt;Pluralsight&lt;/a&gt;, where his insight and experience is invaluable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It has been something like four years that I’ve been working on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flexwiki.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FlexWiki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Not very quickly at times, but I do at least try to put in around an hour every day. For quite a while now, that hour has become more a chore than something I look forward to. But I was committed to completing the tasks I said I would take on, so I kept going. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well, now I’m &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2008/01/10/49874.aspx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. I even checked in my experimental output caching code, although it's not in the 2.0 release.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>49913</id><published>2008-01-14T08:24:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-01-14T08:24:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Using Remote Assistance behind a router</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I work at home, and like most techies I know, I have a router that sits behind my cable modem and provides Internet access for all the computers in my house, both wired and wireless. This router provides a firewall and NAT like most devices of its ilk, and this makes it a little more tricky for me to use Remote Assistance to help my less technical friends and coworkers. The FAQs for Remote Assistance make it sound like if the routers on either end support Universal Plug and Play, you won't have any trouble. If anybody knows how to figure out if a router supports this, leave a comment on this blog entry. I suspect that if you are looking for help using Remote Assistance, your router, like mine, probably doesn't support UPnP.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This morning I spent a few minutes searching and reading FAQs and figured out how to get this working even without UPnP on either side. If you use the same technique I did, your friend's computer will end up establishing a TCP connection to your computer over port 3389. That's the port normally used by Remote Desktop (I assume Remote Assistance is just another version of this anyway, so this makes sense). So the first trick is to set up port forwarding on your router to forward port 3389 to the computer you want to use to help your friend. If you don't know how to do this for your router, contact support for your router device and ask them to help you out (IOW, I'm not going to try to explain it here :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE: &lt;/strong&gt;Unless you're also planning on using Remote Desktop to access your own computer from the Internet, you should ensure that Remote Desktop is disabled on your computer, because by forwarding port 3389 to your computer, you are allowing Internet access to your remote desktop port. To verify this, right-click My Computer and choose Properties|Remote settings. Ensure that Remote Desktop is disabled (it's the lower group box, and it's disabled by default: "Don't allow connections to this computer").&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With Remote Assistance, your friend has three options for requesting assistance from you. He can send an email, a file, or use Windows Live Messenger to initiate the request. I first had my friend try the email option, but I suspected it wouldn't work based on the FAQs I'd read earlier. And sure enough, it did not; when I opened the attachment in the resulting email, typed in our previously agreed upon password and clicked Yes to initiate the connection, the connection request timed out. It makes me wonder if in that case my computer wasn't trying to connect to his. But I didn't spend time diagnosing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, I asked my friend to initiate the request via Windows Live Messenger. He double-clicked my name, which brought up a chat window. Under the Actions or Tools menu (I forget which) he selected, "Request remote assistance", which brought up a chat window with the typical "Accept" and "Decline" links. I clicked accept, and after about 10 seconds and a second confirmation from him, I was looking at his screen. Woohoo! Then I clicked "Take Control" and after his confirmation, I was able to control his machine remotely, even though both of us were behind firewall/NAT devices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here's the two pages that were most helpful for me:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/helpandsupport/rafaq-technical.mspx"&gt;Remote Assistance FAQ for Technical Users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/helpandsupport/learnmore/remoteassist/viaim.mspx"&gt;Start a Remote Assistance Session from Windows Messenger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hope this helps someone out there get RA working. It's a great way to help out your coworkers, friends and family!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>57</thr:total></entry><entry><id>50205</id><published>2008-02-12T18:03:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-02-12T18:03:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Using Remote Assistance behind a router</title><content type="html">It only worked because one of you were behind a UPnP device (router).  If both were behind non-UpnP "routers", it wouldn't work.  You can tell if your device is UPnP by issuing a ticket (ask for Remote Assistance) and opening it in Wordpad.  If it has a public IP address in it then your device is UPnP.  If it has only the local address of your computer (192.168.xxx.xxx:3389) then the device is non-UPnP or UPnP hasn't been enabled in the device.  If both are behind non-UPnP devices, you can save the ticket as a file, edit the file and insert your public address (use WhatIsMyIP.com to determine that), and send the ticket to the "expert/helper" by email.  Be sure port 3389 is open to your computer.  I just went thru all of this with a few friends.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to

type="html">&lt;p&gt;My continuing saga using &lt;a href="http://onecare.live.com"&gt;Windows Live OneCare&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like most security products, this one puts an icon in the taskbar. This one glows green if everything is OK, yellow if there's somthing minor wrong, or red if there's something really wrong. For example, it'll glow red while your firewall is disabled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the way, that's one thing I really like about this product. In Windows XP, if you wanted to turn off the firewall, you could, but then you'd have to remember to turn it back on. With OneCare's replacement firewall, you get a more reasonable option:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/images/blogged/firewall_off.jpg" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, once you turn off the firewall, the taskbar icon glows red until you turn it back on. That's pure goodness!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What bothers me about OneCare is that, at least for me, the taskbar icon glows yellow all the time. At first, I'd always go look at the OneCare dashboard to see what was wrong, only to find that OneCare thought my computer needed updates. There's a button there that takes you to Windows Update, so naturally I'd click it to see what updates I was missing. 9 out of 10 times, I'd find that there were no high-priority updates for my computer. I have automatic updates turned on, so this isn't terribly surprising.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking in the forums, I found other people who have the same problem. They were told to contact OneCare support to try to figure out what update their computer needed. That just seems wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So the yellow light I'm seeing from Windows Live OneCare is just that: a broken light. It's already got me trained to ignore it. Not good!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>49967</id><published>2008-01-18T07:26:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-01-18T07:26:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Turning on cruise control</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent most of the day yesterday getting &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://ccnet.thoughtworks.com/"&gt;CruiseControl.NET&lt;/a&gt; set up here at &lt;a target="_blank" href=""&gt;Pluralsight&lt;/a&gt;. We're always working on little projects (well, some larger than others) and making use of continuous integration seemed like a great idea. I was surprised how easy it was to get started with it. &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/craig"&gt;Craig&lt;/a&gt; was the impetus behind this effort, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best tip I can offer for you if you're thinking of installing and using CruiseControl.NET is to notice that there are actually two versions of the server, ccnet.exe and ccservice.exe. These do exactly the same thing, only one runs from the command line and the other runs in the background as a service. When you log in as an administrator and run ccnet.exe it naturally runs very smoothly. And this is where I started, with a very simple project that downloads code from one of our &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/"&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt; repositories. Once I got a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://nant.sourceforge.net/"&gt;NANT&lt;/a&gt; script working to build and deploy the code (I forgot how much I loved &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://ant.apache.org/"&gt;ANT&lt;/a&gt;; such a great idea for handling builds), I used ccnet to start testing the build under CruiseControl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I debugged my NANT script and ccnet configuration, I tried flipping over to the service, and of course it simply didn't work. Naturally I wanted to run the service under a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.GuideBook/HowToChooseAnIdentityForADaemon.html"&gt;low-privilege account&lt;/a&gt;, but that account didn't have permissions to write to the CruiseControl log file, didn't have credentials to download files from our subversion repository, didn't have permissions to write those files to the working directory or deploy to the deployment folder. So here's the key: instead of debugging all of this using ccservice, just use &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/0a688988-b5d1-494a-be98-61e3434c57151033.mspx?mfr=true"&gt;runas&lt;/a&gt; to run a command prompt under the same user account that you plan to use for the service. Once I did that, I was able to figure out exactly what things I needed to do, from caching Subversion credentials in the user profile for the account, to setting up appropriate ACLs so the account could move files around and write to CruiseControl logs (which I also moved out of CruiseControl's program directory).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got ccnet.exe working properly under the low-privilege account, I switched back to using the service, and voila! We now have a functioning installation of CruiseControl.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>9</thr:total></entry><entry><id>49970</id><published>2008-01-18T10:04:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-01-18T10:04:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Turning on cruise control</title><content type="html">Take a look at Team Foundation Server.

After my first class, I was hooked. I loved meeting new people, finding out what they were working on, and seeing the light go on over their heads when they learned something new. I found it was a great way to help people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the years, I learned from some of the best in the business (many of whom are no longer in the business, but who I still respect immensely): &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/default.aspx"&gt;Don&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/"&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/default.aspx"&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/fritz/default.aspx"&gt;Fritz&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Ted_Pattison/591663783"&gt;Ted&lt;/a&gt;, to name a few. One thing I realized from the start watching these guys on stage was that you have to entertain your audience in order to engage them, but it took me many, many years to be able to do this well myself. What finally clicked for me was to relax, be myself, and stop trying to imitate others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I loved &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/"&gt;Jeff'&lt;/a&gt;s recent post on &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001040.html"&gt;The Sesame Street Presentation Rule&lt;/a&gt;. This is excellent advice:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After being on both the giving and receiving end of plenty of presentations, I now realize there's one golden rule which applies to all of them: &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entertain your audience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every slide of your presentation should serve this fundamental vision statement. Is it&lt;/em&gt; entertaining&lt;em&gt;? I don't mean each slide has to contain a wacky joke of some kind. Every slide should &lt;b&gt;provoke a reaction from the audience&lt;/b&gt; -- be it controversial, unexpected, amusing, or a meditative Zen koan. Prod your audience. Do this not only to keep them awake, but to engage their brains. Deliver a series of short, sharp shocks that jolt your audience into a heightened state of engagement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;And for those who haven't yet seen it, this is one of the most entertaining and engaging presentations I've ever seen: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/"&gt;Dick Hardt's Identity 2.0 introduction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>50033</id><published>2008-01-23T12:19:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-01-23T12:19:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: I'm an Entertainer</title><content type="html">I have been teaching at the college and graduate school  level for over 30 years and I agree with you 100%. Students need to pay attention and the best way to do this is make the experience fun. I get pretty good evaluations, and I have heard others whisper that "he (me) is just entertaining". This is not a complement. But evaluations show that not only do my students enjoy the class, they find it very challenging and worthwhile.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So I will keep going the way I always have - self-deprecating, an occasion wise crack, and most of all, just being myself.

&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the employee who responded to your forum post used an phrase that isn't entirely accurate. The issue isn't so much that we "haven't had a good reason."  There are some very complex issues brought about by the new Windows Vista security paradigm that drove the decision to require administrative privileges.

&lt;br /&gt;NCover uses shared memory (for a variety of reasons) to share coverage data between the profiled process and NCover.Console.  There are privileges required when opening memory mappings between different sessions on Windows that require elevated privileges.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;When releasing the last major version of NCover we had some internal debates about whether to require administrative access or not.  In our opinion the trade-offs were unacceptable. We may reconsider the decision for newer versions (and in fact we are rehashing the decisions now after receiving your feedback), but I wanted to assure you that it's much more than simply not having a reason to do the work.  NCover is similar to a debugger in its operation and when you step into that realm, avoiding the need for admin privileges is dicey.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="50002"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>50006</id><published>2008-01-21T12:14:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-01-21T12:14:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: NCover.Console requires admin privileges</title><content type="html">Brad: thanks for the tip - that's a good point you make.

&lt;br /&gt;Peter: Thanks for the quick response.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I can't claim to have written a debugger, or even know much about how they work. But from what I do know, you've got all the permissions you need to debug in user mode as long as you're debugging processes in the same logon session as yourself. You have permission to read and write the process's memory, duplicate handles into and out of the process, etc. Visual Studio is an example of a debugger that works fine under a limited user account as long as you're debugging processes in the same logon session as the debugger itself.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;When you start having to cross logon session boundaries it gets tricky (for example, debugging ASP.NET apps or Windows services). With NCover.Console I don't see that  happening, but perhaps I'm missing something.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Once again, I'd be glad to help out any way I can.

In the case where we are profiling a process in the same session, we could  probably do what we need to do without requiring elevated permissions.  The engineering issue is whether we have several different modes of operation and can intelligently switch between modes in order run at a lower privilege in the cases where it is possible.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="50002"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>50010</id><published>2008-01-21T22:51:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-01-21T22:51:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: NCover.Console requires admin privileges</title><content type="html">Keith,

It's a challenging but tremendously fun task. Since the separation, I've been spending much more time with my kids than I ever did before, and I'm loving it. But I'm still a geek at heart, and I hate doing clerk-like work to figure out what to buy at the grocery store. I'd rather automate much of this menial work so that I have more time to spend with my kids or with my work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My first step in my quest for automation was to find a program that helped me create shopping lists. I bought a copy of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.aislebyaisle.com/"&gt;SimplyShopping&lt;/a&gt;, which has worked pretty well for what it does. What I like about this program is that it helps you print aisle-by-aisle shopping lists, which really speed grocery shopping up tremendously. What I dislike about it is that there's no end-to-end workflow where I can simply list the recipes I want to make for the week and have it print out a shopping list.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I thought of taking the concepts that I like in SimplyShopping and writing a new app that does everything I want it to do. I think I'll eventually do this. But the first thing I need to do is figure out a good data model for a recipe. And once I enter the recipe into my app, I'd like to be able to share it with other people. And what better way to do that then to start with a community-accepted XML format for recipes?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I searched for XML Schema Recipe and happened upon &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.formatdata.com/recipeml/index.html"&gt;RecipeML&lt;/a&gt;, which, based on its copyright, appears to have been around since 1999. They have a DTD but no schema, and the last time the DTD was updated was Nov 2000. Their gallery of applications links to a single app, whose web page no longer exists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another search for Recipe Sharing XML lead me to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.recipemanager.org/rsp/rsp10draft.html"&gt;Recipe Sharing Protocol Specification&lt;/a&gt;, which talks a lot about exchanging data, but very little about how to model a recipe in XML. They refer to something called RSPML, but I can't find that documented anywhere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then there's &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.happy-monkey.net/recipebook/"&gt;RecipeBook XML&lt;/a&gt;, which has a DTD and several sample recipes. This format uses mixed content, which makes me wonder how easy it'd be to program against.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beyond finding an acceptable data model for sharing recipes, the next problem would be to agree on a vocabulary for units of measure. I don't think it'll be possible to come up with a list of ingredient names that everyone would agree upon, so the software processing the recipes would have to deal with that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do you think? Is this an intractable problem? If not, does anyone want to work on this with me? I think it'd be a fun project.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>10</thr:total></entry><entry><id>50078</id><published>2008-01-29T09:29:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-01-29T09:29:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Geeks sharing recipes</title><content type="html">If you wind up defining a new recipe grammar, I highly recommend you consider coming up with an XHTML microformat rather than a custom XML grammar.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="50077"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>50090</id><published>2008-01-29T10:00:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-01-29T10:00:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Geeks sharing recipes</title><content type="html">I'm game.

&lt;br /&gt;My intuition is that you'd settle on one measurement standard (English/Metric) in the interest of making the problem manageable, but make it open, because there's always the "pinch/dash/to taste" value, or a range of values (1/4 - 1/2 Tbsp).  Also, high altitude exceptions - a lot of the time with baking you'll have to add flour when you normally wouldn't.
&lt;br /&gt;I think you'd just have to punt on ingredient names.  That's basically dealing with semantics, in the simpler cases you could establish a simple mapping.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Yikes, how dangerous!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I just finished advising a priest a few weeks ago that he needs to get some girlfriends, because he has a lower chance of catching virus infections by sharing girlfriends than by sharing USB keys.  And here what are you doing, you're sharing sons!  I hope your protection is up to date.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;(P.S., I really gave that advice, though obviously only half-seriously.  In the old days when the internet was mostly Unix, PCs shared viruses by booting and/or executing programs on shared floppy disks.  In the modern world it's easier, because shared USB keys contain files called "autorun.inf" to execute the infectors automatically.  There are an awful lot of people now who can't afford their own PC but can afford their own USB key, so they borrow whatever PC they can get their hands on, and this is one of the results.)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; next problem would be to agree on a
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; vocabulary for units of measure
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;That will never happen.  In countries that are 90% metric, and even though it's trivial to move a decimal point to convert between ml and cl, common practices vary.  Also even though ml and cc are close enough for cooking purposes (not even moving a decimal point), some countries still designate some volumes in cc.  In countries that are 50% metric it's much tougher; does one cup mean 294 ml or 283 ml or 200 ml?</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="50077"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>50118</id><published>2008-01-31T05:54:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-01-31T05:54:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Geeks sharing recipes</title><content type="html">I thought about such a system myself because I'm the one who cook in my home and I also hate to waste time going to a shop just to buy a single item.
&lt;br /&gt;The problems I see in this kind of solution are:
&lt;br /&gt;- creating (or, better, converting) a recipe database that is good enough to provide a good choice of food.
&lt;br /&gt;- sometimes you can find fresh food (fish, season vegetables etc.) at a good price, and changing you menu "on the move" could be a good way to eat more fresh and healthy things, so a mobile version of your app is mandatory :)
&lt;br /&gt;- Here in Italy we use "spoons", "pinches" and "teaspoons" as "measurement units" but usually no "cups"... this may require some smart units conversion to fit the recipes to the users preferences.
&lt;br /&gt;- Sometimes the number of people eating with you may vary, we usually are two people, but sometimes I'm out for work or to play basketball and other times we got friends dining with US... the application should calculate amounts with a default number of people (2 in my case, 4 in yours) but also allow you to change that number for some things.
&lt;br /&gt;- Some ingrediends may be skipped or may be replaced by alternative ones, keep that in mind when designing your XML format.
&lt;br /&gt;- Many edible things are packaged! And you may need to overbuy something to cook a particular recipe. A "empty that fridge" function that allows you to cook something with things that you have at home would be great. A feature that reminds you about things that you will risk to trow away and suggest some recipes using them would be wonderful :)
&lt;br /&gt;My personal solution is to cook pasta or a "risotto" (rice) with anything I find in my fridge... you can use cheese, meat, vegetables, even fruit with a lot of tasty combinations. But not everyone may like it :P
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'm mostly a low-level Windows CE programmer, so I can't help you much with XML and high-level releated issues... 
&lt;br /&gt;But I may provide some very good Italian recipes for your database!

I'm working on a very similar idea, but going even further into the grammar of the english recipe structure.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I've just started to break down each ingredient into its grammatical components: Quantitative Adjective, Adjective, Noun, Adverb.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The trick is writing an app that will convert each line item into these components.  For example: 4 cups thinly sliced green onions becomes:
&lt;br /&gt;    * Quantitative Adjective: 4 cups
&lt;br /&gt;    * Adjective: green
&lt;br /&gt;    * Noun: onions
&lt;br /&gt;    * Adverb: thinly sliced
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The reason behind this is to give ourselves the ability to do more complex joins with other food databases.  Thus linking more information to each ingredient.  I don't want to give too much away, but this something I'm in the middle of right now.  Glad to see other peoples working on the same.  I'd love to help out wherever possible, let me know how your ventures go with grecipe-manager.

The &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grecipe-manager.wiki.sourceforge.net/Windows+Installation"&gt;instructions for Windows users&lt;/a&gt; are pretty old and out of date (the primary audience for this software is in the linux world). But I managed to get it installed and running nevertheless, and if you're reasonably technical, you should be able to do it as well. Once I got the app running for the first time, it immediately appeared to download a boatload of data, which I think was a database of nutritional information for ingredients as well as ingredient/category mappings, and probably other stuff that I've not figured out yet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From the little I've seen of this app, it looks pretty impressive. I'll keep experimenting and post my findings here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are some hopefully helpful hints if you want to give it a try along with me. I installed all of the items on the "Required Packages" list:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;I already had Python 2.5 installed.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The Glade runtime environment was trivial to install.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html"&gt;PyGTK&lt;/a&gt; was a little more complicated. Since these instructions were written, it looks like the project was split into three parts, and I think you need all three (which are trivial to install). I installed the latest versions of each for Python 2.5. Once you get all three installed, add the bin/ directory from the GTK into your path and bring up a python command shell (just run python.exe to do this) then type 'import gtk' and if you don't get any errors, you're probably good.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;PyCairo&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;PyGObject&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;PyGTK&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PyWin32 install was trivial.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;PIL was also trivial.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;PyRTF is python sources, which you'll need to install. Copy the directory to a drive somewhere, then bring up a command shell and CD into the directory you just created. You should find a setup.py file there. Run 'python setup.py install' to install. This is what I'll call a "python install" from now on.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;ReportLab also requires a "python install", so do the same thing.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;PySqlite2 - the website is down as I write this, so I don't recall what type of install it requires, but I don't remember having trouble with it...&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Metakit - this one I couldn't quite figure out how to install, but it appears to be an optional thing.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you've installed all of the prerequisites, it's easy to install &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grecipe-manager.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Gourmet Recipe Manager&lt;/a&gt;. It's also a python install, and once you've run the setup.py script, you can launch the program as described in section 3 of the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://grecipe-manager.wiki.sourceforge.net/Windows+Installation"&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>50250</id><published>2008-02-14T13:35:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-02-14T13:35:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Workflow Services Context</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The cool new wsHttpContextBinding and friends silently manage a workflow instance id for you under the covers. The first time you make a request through one of these bindings, a workflow is created, and the instance id is sent back to the client via a SOAP header. It's then stored in the channel and sent back with every subsequent request so that further requests can be routed back to the same workflow instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all well and good, but what if you want to contact an *existing* workflow? You'll need to communicate the workflow instance id to the channel manually. This is possible by querying the channel's context. You'll need to add a reference to System.WorkflowServices (if you've not already got one). Once you do that, you can use this code to get the InstanceId guid from the channel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code was tested with Visual Studio 2008 RTM.&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;// note if you're using a code-generated proxy, you'll need to use channel.InnerChannel&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;tt&gt;IContextManager contextManager =((IChannel)channel).GetProperty&lt;ICONTEXTMANAGER&gt;&lt;ICONTEXTMANAGER&gt;();&lt;br /&gt;IDictionary&lt;STRING string="string"&gt; ctx = contextManager.GetContext();&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;// read the instance ID from the context...&lt;br /&gt;Guid instanceId = new Guid(ctx["instanceId"]);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;// or, maybe you need to update the context of a new channel...&lt;br /&gt;ctx["instanceId"] = instanceId.ToString();&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;// ...and set it back on the channel (or a new channel)&lt;br /&gt;contextManager.SetContext(ctx);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/STRING&gt;&lt;/ICONTEXTMANAGER&gt;&lt;/ICONTEXTMANAGER&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps - I'm recording this mainly for my own recall :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>50374</id><published>2008-03-05T06:19:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-03-05T06:19:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Fix your jumpy optical mouse</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the last few years, I've owned a couple of different optical mice. I started with a Logitech mouse and recently switched to a Microsoft mouse (Wireless Laser Mouse 6000). During the time I've owned these mice I've been frustrated by how they would jump around from time to time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the old days, I knew that to fix a standard mouse, you'd simply open the undercarriage, pop out the little ball, and scrape the crap off the rollers that accumulates over time. Voila! Your mouse would run like new. But there's no moving parts on the optical mouse, and it sure looked clean to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Invariably when my optical mouse would start to act up, I'd start switching surfaces, which sometimes seemed to help for awhile, but nothing really solved my problem, and I was about to go back to using a wired mouse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, I feel pretty stupid, because I figured out how to fix the damn thing this morning. A bit of googling lead me to &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pcmech.com/article/jumpy-optical-mouse/"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; which said that sometimes a little hair (or a piece of dust, I'd imagine) gets trapped in with the optical sensor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Lucida Console"&gt;The solution?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Lucida Console"&gt;Blow out the little hole where the optical sensor lies.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A quick puff of air cleared up my problem. Tada, new mouse. God I feel stupid. I think later today I'll pick up a dark, nonreflective mousepad to use, since this seems to be the recommended surface.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>166</thr:total></entry><entry><id>50836</id><published>2008-05-04T06:56:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-05-04T06:56:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Fix your jumpy optical mouse</title><content type="html">Technology - if it doesn't work, kick it.  If it still fails to work, replace it!  It seems that as technology advances the troubleshooting and solutions retreat back to the stone age.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;  With all the software geniuses and their ever increasing intelligent software, you'd think someone would have solved this problem by now!  I'm no programmer (not since my C64 in the 80s), just a problem solver, but it seems to me that all is needed here is a bit of very basic intelligence...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If mouse input =&amp;lt; X then cursor output = X
&lt;br /&gt;If mouse input &amp;gt; X then ignore
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;  I know it's a bit more complicated than that, adding in a comparison with average acceleration etc, but you'd think someone would have written a patch or one of these multi-million dollar companies would have it in their drivers already.  I don't think it would be too difficult to distinguish the normal pace of a mouse's movement from a sudden thousand pixel jump, but again I am no programmer.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="50374"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>52498</id><published>2008-08-14T20:30:47.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-08-14T20:30:47.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Fix your jumpy optical mouse</title><content type="html">WOW blowing the lenses ACTUALY WORKS OMG :D</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="50374"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>54172</id><published>2008-10-30T07:03:34.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-10-30T07:03:34.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Fix your jumpy optical mouse</title><content type="html">worked for me thanks was searching for software solution to this problem when came to this site and found it was lens needed cleaning thanks</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="50374"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>55613</id><published>2008-12-08T02:15:45.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-12-08T02:15:45.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Fix your jumpy optical mouse</title><content type="html">Holy...I was messing with the settings on my Razer Copperhead for like 15 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong, and lo-and-behold, a quick puff of air to the laser lens and all is better.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="50374"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>56685</id><published>2009-02-11T02:08:47.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-02-11T02:08:47.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Fix your jumpy optical mouse</title><content type="html">Brilliant!

type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/archive/2008/01/18/49967.aspx"&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt;, I talked about my experience enabling continuous integration for the internal builds here at Pluralsight. I recently worked with Craig to restructure our nant build. As part of that, I wanted to ensure that I could run the build from anywhere in the source tree. We use a typical hierarchical build where each project has a build script that knows how to compile, test, deploy, etc. based on the specified target. Then at the top of the tree, there's a build script that runs all the other ones. That root build script is what gets run automatically by &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://ccnet.thoughtworks.com/"&gt;Cruise Control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My root script defines a bunch of properties, like where the output directories for the overall build live, where the tools live, and so on. And that works fine when I run the build from the root. The properties get defined, all the child scripts are run with &amp;lt;nant/&amp;gt; tasks, and they see those properties. But if I want to drill down into the tree and run one of the build scripts lower down, suddenly there's problems because it depends on properties that are only defined in the root script. I really like being able to run builds from anywhere in the tree for perf - if I'm trying to fix a particular project, I don't necessarily want to wait for unit tests on the entire tree to run in order to see if mine passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig made a great suggestion. Put the properties into a separate script (we named it properties.nant) and &amp;lt;include/&amp;gt; that script. Then to enable hierarchical builds, we'd create a properties.nant file for each folder in the tree, which would &amp;lt;include/&amp;gt; its parent. That way I could define properties anywhere in the tree, and they would be "inherited" by anything below it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took that idea one step further, because I didn't want to maintain a bunch of property scripts with nothing in them but an &amp;lt;include/&amp;gt; for the parent. I wrote an &amp;lt;includefromparent/&amp;gt; nant task that walks up the directory tree looking for the target file. So now I can do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;includefromparent buildfile="properties.nant"/&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This worked great! But now I ran into a problem. Many of my properties are defined like so in the root properties.nant file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;property name="libraryOutputDir" value="${project::get-base-directory()}\artifacts\libraries"/&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see the issue? If I run the build with the root script, everything works fine, because it's the root nant project I'm building, and get-base-directory() refers to the root of the project, where the artifacts folder lives. But if I run from lower in the tree, it's a different project, and get-base-directory() refers to a subfolder, where the artifacts folder definitely should NOT be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed a way to find the root of the project tree. So I build a second really simple nant task:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;findmarkeddir markerfile="filetolookfor.txt" property="root"/&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This task simply looks up the directory hierarchy until it finds the specified marker file, then puts the name of that directory (the "marked" directory) into a designated property (here I've called it root). With that in place, I rewrote my property definitions in terms of the base directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;property name="libraryOutputDir" value="${root}\artifacts\libraries"/&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voilà! I can now run builds from any of my build scripts. They inherit properties hierarchically like you'd expect, and the system is quite easy to maintain. If you'd like to use these tasks, I've included the code for them below (not much code, really). And if you've never written a nant task yourself before, here's &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/rcase/archive/2005/01/06/5971.aspx"&gt;the article&lt;/a&gt; I used to figure out how it's done (it's super easy). &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://nant.sourceforge.net/release/latest/help/fundamentals/tasks.html#taskloader"&gt;Here's&lt;/a&gt; what you should read to learn about the various options for deploying your custom task assembly so nant recognizes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;b&gt;FindMarkedDirTask.cs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using NAnt.Core;
using NAnt.Core.Attributes;
using System.IO;

namespace PluralsightNantTasks {

[TaskName("findmarkeddir")]
public class FindMarkedDirTask : Task {

  [TaskAttribute("markerfile", Required = true)]
  [StringValidator(AllowEmpty = false)]
  public string MarkerFileName { get; set; }

  [TaskAttribute("property", Required = true)]
  [StringValidator(AllowEmpty = false)]
  public string PropertyName { get; set; }

  protected override void ExecuteTask() {
    string searchDir = this.Project.BaseDirectory;
    do {
      if (MarkerFileExistsIn(searchDir)) {
        this.Project.Properties[PropertyName] = searchDir;
        return;
      }
      searchDir = ParentOf(searchDir);
    } while (!IsRootDirectory(searchDir));
  }

  private bool IsRootDirectory(string path) {
    return Path.GetPathRoot(path) == Path.GetFullPath(path);
  }

  private string ParentOf(string directory) {
    return Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(directory, ".."));
  }

  private bool MarkerFileExistsIn(string directory) {
    return File.Exists(Path.Combine(directory, MarkerFileName));
  }
}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is &lt;b&gt;IncludeFromParentTask.cs&lt;/b&gt; (note I derive from the built-in include task):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;using System;

    if (fileName.Contains("/") || fileName.Contains(@"\\"))
      throw new BuildException(string.Format(
        CultureInfo.CurrentCulture,
        "buildfile attribute must only be a filename"));

    string relativePathToFoundFile = SearchParentDirectory(
      Project.BaseDirectory, fileName, 0);
      
    if (null == relativePathToFoundFile)
      throw new BuildException(string.Format(
        CultureInfo.CurrentCulture,
        "Couldn't find a file named {0}" +
        " in a parent directory of {1}",
        fileName, Project.BaseDirectory));

    // have to use a relative path here
    // because &lt;include&gt;&lt;/include&gt; task uses
    // Path.Combine(projectDir, BuildFileName)
    // to get the full path
    BuildFileName = relativePathToFoundFile;

    base.Initialize();
  }

  private string SearchParentDirectory(string directory,
                        string fileName, int searchDepth) {
    ++searchDepth;
  
    // see if we've traversed all the way to the root
    string currentPath = Path.GetFullPath(directory);
    if (currentPath == Path.GetPathRoot(currentPath))
      return null;

    // recurse until we find the file
    string parentDir = Path.GetFullPath(
      Path.Combine(currentPath, ".."));
    string path = Path.Combine(parentDir, fileName);
    if (File.Exists(path)) {
      StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
      for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; searchDepth; ++i)
        sb.Append(@"..\");
      return Path.Combine(sb.ToString(), fileName);
    }
    else return SearchParentDirectory(parentDir,
                          fileName, searchDepth);
  }
}

&lt;p&gt;This is a minor update. Here's what was changed (from the readme file):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;      Incorporated a patch from Richard Howells to give&lt;br /&gt;      you the option to turn on/off the "Always On Top" behavior&lt;br /&gt;      of the main form. I still recommend not keeping PWM in&lt;br /&gt;      memory all the time - only run it when you need it to keep&lt;br /&gt;      your master key safe. I also used adjusted the Auto-gen&lt;br /&gt;      password dialog to be more reasonable: it now by default&lt;br /&gt;      specifies a 12-char password, not the 20 it used to - most&lt;br /&gt;      websites can't handle a password that long. I also removed&lt;br /&gt;      the lower case 'l' and punctuation, with a button that allows&lt;br /&gt;      you to add back in the puncutation marks if you want.&lt;br /&gt;      One last minor thing - I added AcceptsReturn=true to the&lt;br /&gt;      notes editor so it won't disappear when you press Enter :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your Password Minder utility.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;However, I noticed a few issues that I thought I'd bring to your attention.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;1) It won't launch without installation of the VS2008 C++ redist.  If this is intentional, you might like to include this in your installation notes.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;2) The "send password to another window" feature doesn't work on Visa (SP1).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;3)It won't launch on x64.  It should be able to run as a 32-bit app on x64 under WOW64.  However, it's not working.  Suspect the assembly needs to be marked as 32-bit only (ie I'm suggesting that it's failing as it's trying to run 64-bit and some of your interop won't work in 64-bit without code changes).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Regards,

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I have modified PWM to use SQL Server instead XML files (import/export still uses files) to store the records and settings.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Are there any security problems using SQL instead of files that would make your application less secure?

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;1. Could you post an x64 version of Password Minder as the 32-bit version posted fails to start under Vista x64 SP1.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;2. Is there anyway to fill in the password field of a prompt under Vista SP1 which uses the new Credential UI and Credential SSP? When we attempt to paste a password into such a field nothing happens. An example is attempting to save RDP credentials using a .RDP file for a remote desktop connection on Vista SP1. Basically because Microsoft now prevents CONTROL-V from working, we can't use random passwords for our critical accounts anymore which has lowered security here.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Thanks

It crashes immediately with error "An unhandled exception ('System.IO.FileLoadException') occurred in pwm.exe [3792]."

First thanks for the password minder utility program. I've been using it for quit a while now. However I just repaved my machine and would like to install it again.

The link to the tools page up above (http://www.pluralsight.com/tools.aspx) does not seem to work. I get a 404 page. Is the password minder still available?

Greetings Dick.

It has to do with lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say you want to populate a list box or drop down list of choices by calling a static method - you can wire up an ObjectDataSource to do that. But then in your Page's Load event, you may want to look up a record and &lt;em&gt;select one of those choices&lt;/em&gt; based on data from that record. Maybe the user chose the item in the past and you're looking in the user's profile to recall her choice. Well, you'll quickly find that Load fires &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; declarative data binding has occurred. You'll probably discover this like I did when you get an error because there are no items in the list to select from. In the past I've simply avoided declarative data binding when I ran into this problem and used programmatic data binding instead (control.DataSource=collection; control.DataBind; control.SelectedIndex=whatever;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today I talked with &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/fritz/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/fritz" title="Fritz Onion, author of Essential ASP.NET"&gt;Fritz&lt;/a&gt; Onion, ASP.NET guru, and we figured out when declarative data binding actually occurs. We tested LoadComplete, and that wasn't late enough. Then we figured certainly DDB would happen before PreRender. No such luck. So finally Fritz suggested testing out PreRenderComplete, and that worked like a charm. So by the time PreRenderComplete has fired, DDB has already taken place and you can safely make list selections for lists that have been populated via DDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current solution looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs args) {
    if (!IsPostBack)
        PreRenderComplete += PopulateControlsFromUserData;
}
void PopulateControlsFromUserData(object sender, EventArgs args) {
    // DDB has already happened, so party on!
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Glad you enjoyed the session. Claims transformation can happen in a lot of places. If it happens external to the application using the claims, e.g. in an STS, the issuer of the new claimset should absolutely sign the claims (WCF has plumbing to produce signed security tokens, which is how we ship around claims).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But if you're doing the claims xform right in your application, there's no need to sign anything; you just use a local identifier for the issuer (I used the "System" claimset in my example). The WCF plumbing that accepts claims from clients won't ever issue a "System" claimset, so as long as you're checking the issuer, you don't need to worry about someone faking your internal claimset.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;HTH!
&lt;br /&gt;

I am pretty sure it will simplify life and solve a lot of problems.
But the name “Information Card” used here is a deception - behind it’s veil it is only a piece of Software, not any Card in your hands at all! And everybody knows meanwhile what can be done with Software!

Information Cards will only be secure if there are real cards in use:
Not only passwords, every security measure running directly on a PC only is vulnerable, and virtual ID-Cards (which are only data stored on your computer), are an invitation to pishers! They only have to upload this ID-Card from your Computer, and pishers get everything they like to have! 

Why? There is a not curable flaw:
Everything running directly on a PC (specially with MS-Software) can be faked or spied on. 

The only thing which helps is an external ID (Card or USB-Dongle) with embedded Microprocessor which handles all the login communication with embedded cryptography and 
refuses to be spied on. 

And even if you trust your computer software and think that nobody can get your data, you have to give your essential personal identity data to the company which is issuing the ID-Card - there is another vulnerability. These Companies have all your data and the possibility to access all your WEB-based connections. Who is supervising these Companies? 
Who is securing the security of your identity there?

I worked with the European eEurope Smart Card Initiative in 2000 and we discussed all the security problems - there is only one solution for real security: a device outside the computer, communicating with, but not affected by the Computer and/or the Internet!
It is a myth that data on your computer are safe, even if big companies are involved and say so.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="51662"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>52458</id><published>2008-08-12T16:31:23.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-08-12T16:31:23.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Information Card Foundation</title><content type="html">Dirk,

There are different levels of security, and not every scenario calls for  two-factor authentication and/or a smart card. Information cards require authentication in order to be used, and the level of authentication depends on the issuer - you could certainly issue a managed card that required proof that the user holds a smart card if you wanted to.

Thanks for your response! Of course there are applications where you do not need the highest level of security. But in this case it is okay to stay with a password! I have seen with my own eyes that even heads of security departments are not aware how their precious passwords are processed - seeing their secret password on my monitor-screen made them freak out.
And I am pretty sure the Information-Card Login-Procedure can be monitored, too.

You wrote "the level of authentication depends on the issuer" -just this what People should know . People should know the limits and drawbacks of security. Otherwise a new circle of Insecurities and Security Breaches and even lost of personal identity Data may follow.

If there is a possibility to have a physical ID-Card with embedded cryptography as I wrote earlier using the PC only as a "dumb terminal" to establish a connection, this will be secure. But there is a  vulnerability for identity-theft as soon as there are identifying data and/or is software on the PC doing all this.

And there is yet another point of vulnerability:
Even if you trust your computer software and think that nobody can get your data, you have to give your essential personal identity data to the company which is issuing the ID-Card - there is another vulnerability. These Companies have all your data and the possibility to access all your WEB-based connections. Who is supervising these Companies?

We didn't want to build an empire, and we weren't out to get rich. We just wanted a place where we could comfortably practice what we love to do: giving software developers a boost - watching that light go on over their heads when a new concept becomes clear.

It's clearly important to David to connect with his students, and he does so in a way that lets them know that it's all about them - he's not there just to show off his mad skillz (which he has in abundance!)

See &lt;a href="/community/blogs/keith/archive/2008/11/26/zermatt-is-now-geneva-framework.aspx"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a couple of years now, I've been giving talks about "claims-based identity", and "claims-aware applications". The most concrete example of a claims-based identity architecture that I've been able to show so far is Active Directory Federation Services v1 (ADFS) and Windows CardSpace. And the claims programming model I've been using is the one that shipped with WCF in the System.IdentityModel assembly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But today I'm happy to announce that there's a new path forward in the claims world. &lt;a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/Downloads/DownloadDetails.aspx?SiteID=642&amp;amp;DownloadID=12937"&gt;Zermatt&lt;/a&gt; is the "identity framework" that I've been itching to talk about, but until today, hasn't been announced publicly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vbertocci/"&gt;Vittorio&lt;/a&gt; just made the &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vbertocci/archive/2008/07/09/announcing-the-beta-release-of-zermatt-developer-identity-framework.aspx"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; just a moment ago, and now you can get your hands on this new framework. With it, you can build web applications and services that rely on claims to discover identity details about users. And you can easily build a security token service (STS) that supplies those claims. Zermatt makes this possible by supplying all of the plumbing that implements WS-Trust (for web services) and WS-Federation (for browser-based web applications). All you have to do is figure out what claims you want to issue based on what you know about the user and what you know about the application (aka relying party).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fortunate to be asked by the team to write the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/aa570351.aspx"&gt;white paper&lt;/a&gt; introducing Zermatt to developers. You can download it here. The paper introduces the ideas behind claims-based identity, and talks about how you can use Zermatt to centralize authentication (and to some degree, authorization) in an STS, thus making it easy to achieve single sign on in your applications, and even be ready to federate with other organizations or platforms should that need arise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some highlights of what you'll find in Zermatt:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zermatt includes a new claims programming model, with IClaimsPrincipal and IClaimsIdentity, two new interfaces that extend the existing IPrincipal and IIdentity that you already know and love from the .NET Framework. IClaimsIdentity adds a collection of claims. Zermatt's claims programming model is in many ways simpler than that in WCF - the Claim class exposes the value of claims as strings (always) and calls the value of a claim "Value", instead of "Resource" as WCF did. But the model is also more sophisticated - multi-hop delegation is supported, so one user can "Act As" another user, and the relying party will see the entire chain of delegation as a linked list of IClaimsIdentity objects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zermatt includes an HttpModule that you can wire into your ASP.NET application that will implement WS-Federation for you. This module (called the FAM) is a lot like the "Web Agent" from ADFS, and it makes it quite easy to build a web application that relies on claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zermatt includes plumbing that sits on top of WCF and simplifies building claims-based web services and clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zermatt also includes a couple of ASP.NET controls for adding SignIn functionality to websites. The first is a passive sign-in control which simply redirects the browser to an STS to get claims. The second is the highly anticipated InformationCard control that pops the user's identity selector and lets her choose which identity she wants to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zermatt comes with a bunch of sample code to help you get started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you need to test-drive Zermatt is Visual Studio 2008 and your curiosity. Download the beta now, read the whitepaper, experiment with the samples, and see what claims-based identity is all about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more on Zermatt, you'll want to watch &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vbertocci/"&gt;Vittorio's blog&lt;/a&gt;.

It's generally a really easy to use control, but I've always struggled with getting column widths to look right.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My goal is to fix the width of each column at design time, and any field that contains text that may be longer than my fixed width should wrap around, taking up more vertical space in the table. If you are trying to accomplish this goal, you might find these tips helpful.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;1) Set up a CssClass for the GridView itself and include the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/tables.html#fixed-table-layout"&gt;table-layout:fixed&lt;/a&gt; style. This tells the browser that you're going to specify the width of each cell. You may also want to include the overall width of the grid here as I mention in (3).&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;2) The first row of the table sets the width for each cell, and that's usually the HEADER row, not the item row, so use either HeaderStyle-CssClass or HeaderStyle-Width to set the width of the cell. I wasted a lot of time trying to set the width using the ItemStyle.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;3) Make certain the table itself is wide enough to hold all of the cells. I added up all of my cell widths and used that to set the width via the CssClass attribute on the GridView.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Using these guidelines, I'm having much better luck controlling the layout of my GridView controls. I hope this simple advise helps someone else!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>14</thr:total></entry><entry><id>52295</id><published>2008-07-31T06:31:39.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-07-31T06:31:39.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Controlling column width in a GridView</title><content type="html">thanks i was looking for this...</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="52286"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>52465</id><published>2008-08-13T06:32:04.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-08-13T06:32:04.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Controlling column width in a GridView</title><content type="html">Thanks a lot Keith

It allows you to simulate sending an email message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick to doing this is not to hardcode things like host, port, etc. for your SMTP server when you use System.Net.Mail to send mail. Instead, use the default ctor for &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.mail.smtpclient.aspx"&gt;SmtpClient&lt;/a&gt; as I've done in the code below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Main(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;[] args)&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// note the use of the MailAddress class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// this allows me to specify display names as well as email addresses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    MailAddress from = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; MailAddress(&lt;span class="str"&gt;"admin@fabrikam.com"&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="str"&gt;"Fabrikam Website"&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;br /&gt;    MailAddress to = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; MailAddress(&lt;span class="str"&gt;"mari@fabrikam.com"&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="str"&gt;"Mari Joyce"&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    MailMessage msg = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; MailMessage(from, to);&lt;br /&gt;    msg.Subject  = &lt;span class="str"&gt;"Testing 123"&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;    msg.Body = &lt;span class="str"&gt;"This is only a test!"&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// note use of default ctor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// this looks in config to figure out how to send mail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; SmtpClient().Send(msg);&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you're telling .NET by using the default ctor for SmtpClient is, "please use my config file to figure out how to send mail". Now you can use the system.net/mailSettings/smtp section in config to specify the details of your mail server, and all of the code in your app that is written to use the default SmtpClient ctor will inherit these settings. Here's an example of what the config on a production server might look like (if you put passwords in your config files, be sure to &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms998283.aspx"&gt;encrypt those sections&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;system.net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;mailSettings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;smtp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;deliveryMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;="Network"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;network&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;="mail.fabrikam.com"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;                 &lt;span class="attr"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;="25"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;                 &lt;span class="attr"&gt;userName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;="WebsiteMailAccount"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;                 &lt;span class="attr"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;="whatever"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;smtp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;mailSettings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;system.net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During development, I use different settings because I don't usually want to deal with the hassle of installing an SMTP server on my development box. Instead, I want email messages delivered as individual files in a directory on my hard drive (I always have a c:\mail directory on my development box for just this purpose):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;system.net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;mailSettings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;smtp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;deliveryMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;="SpecifiedPickupDirectory"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;specifiedPickupDirectory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;pickupDirectoryLocation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;="c:\mail"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;smtp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;mailSettings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;system.net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when I run the program above, I get a .EML file in my c:\mail directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/community/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/keith/image_5F00_2.png"&gt;&lt;img height="230" border="0" width="404" src="/community/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/keith/image_5F00_thumb.png" alt="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 35px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outlook Express is normally registered as the viewer for .EML files, so double-click the file to view it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/community/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/keith/image_5F00_4.png"&gt;&lt;img height="287" border="0" width="292" src="/community/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/keith/image_5F00_thumb_5F00_1.png" alt="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 35px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

The stack trace looks the same because of the way the methods are invoked (via reflection) - you end up with a stack trace for a TargetInvocationException, which basically says, "I used reflection to invoke some method, and it threw an exception. See the inner exception for details."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASP.NET's health monitoring system does list the inner exceptions (apparently up to a maximum depth of two, from spelunking the code with &lt;a href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/"&gt;reflector&lt;/a&gt;), but it does not emit the stack traces for these exceptions, which would be &lt;i&gt;really helpful&lt;/i&gt;. I've spent some time this morning trying to figure out how I'd customize things to emit this, and it looks like what I'd have to do is catch the exception and generate a custom WebEvent that overrides ToString(bool, bool) and does everything that WebRequestErrorEvent does, but also generate the inner stack trace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems a bit ugly. A search for "ASP.NET web event inner exception stack trace" yielded no interesting results, so if you've dealt with this and have a cleaner solution, let me know. I'll post my solution once I get it worked out.&lt;/p&gt;

I believe that the FormatToString method of the WebBaseErrorEvent class can help.

I spent the morning doing some further spelunking with &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/"&gt;reflector&lt;/a&gt;, and my first solution was to implement a custom WebEvent that overrides ToString() to format itself with all of the data I care about. I then overrode the Error event via global.asax and raised my custom event, instead of letting ASP.NET raise its default event. This worked reasonably well with the SimpleMailWebEventProvider, but didn't seem to change anything at all with the event log provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I found is that the two providers were using entirely different means to format the events! The email provider calls ToString(bool, bool) on the event to ask it to format itself. But the EventLogWebEventProvider does its own formatting of individual fields of the event. Indeed, its ProcessEvent method has a big list of checks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (eventRaised &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; WebBaseErrorEvent)&lt;br /&gt;    AddErrorStuff();&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (eventRaised &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; WebAuthenticationSuccessAuditEvent)&lt;br /&gt;    AddLogonStuff();&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seemed like a better approach would be to write my own provider. I left the event log provider alone, and I wrote a custom email provider to display errors in a more useful way. This also allowed me to drop some fields from the event report that aren't useful for us. And I was able to construct a much more concise and useful subject line (the subject line that SimpleMailWebEventProvider uses is rather clunky since it assumes it might be spitting out a whole bunch of buffered events in one go).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does my provider include the stack traces for all of the exceptions in the chain, but in the subject line, I display the type of error that is at the root of the problem. So if I am formatting a TargetInvocationException, I drill into its InnerException chain until I find a different exception type, and display that exception type instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, one other benefit of building the custom provider instead of using a custom WebEvent was that I was then able to remove the Error handler from global.asax. All I had to do was replace the SimpleMailWebEventProvider with my own provider, and I got the behavior I wanted. Now my email notifications include detailed stack traces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll post the code for this provider once it's run for a little while in production and I'm satisfied that it works reasonably well.&lt;/p&gt;

Until that is, you try to use a format string:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Bind("AmountCharged", "{0:C}")&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While this displays just as you'd expect (e.g., $200), it doesn't do so well when you submit an edit that includes the same value ($200):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 14pt; color: maroon; font-family: 'Verdana'"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Input string was not in a correct format.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I searched around and didn't find much in the way of a clean solution, but I did solve the problem with just a few lines of code. The trick is to handle the data-bound control's Updating event. Since I was working with a GridView, my solution looked a bit like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;asp:GridView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;DataSourceID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;='myDataSource'&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attr"&gt;OnRowUpdating&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;='FixFormatting'&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attr"&gt;AutoGenerateColumns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;='false'&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attr"&gt;CellPadding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;="3" ...&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the OnRowUpdating handler that I've installed in my grid view. That code looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; FixFormatting(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; sender, GridViewUpdateEventArgs args)
{
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;decimal&lt;/span&gt; amountPaid = ParseDecimal((&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;)args.NewValues[&lt;span class="str"&gt;"AmountPaid"&lt;/span&gt;]);
    args.NewValues[&lt;span class="str"&gt;"AmountPaid"&lt;/span&gt;] = amountPaid;
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you handle this event, you're given a dictionary of old and new values, which appear to come directly from the controls (in my case, a TextBox was used to gather the updated data AmountPaid, so the type of object that I found in NewValues["AmountPaid"] was a string. I wrote a little helper method called ParseDecimal that parses a string into a decimal value, allowing currency characters, decimal points, and thousands separators. I also allowed a blank value to indicate zero:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;decimal&lt;/span&gt; ParseDecimal(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;)
{
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;.IsNullOrEmpty(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;))
        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; 0;
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; Decimal.Parse(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;,
        NumberStyles.AllowThousands |
        NumberStyles.AllowDecimalPoint |
        NumberStyles.AllowCurrencySymbol,
        CultureInfo.InstalledUICulture);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solved the problem quite nicely. Now two-way binding works with formatted data.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>52525</id><published>2008-08-17T06:53:46.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-08-17T06:53:46.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">My favorite links from the 3rd week of August 2008</title><content type="html">My favorite links from the 3rd week of August 2008</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="52504"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>55685</id><published>2008-12-13T07:00:42.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-12-13T07:00:42.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Kostenloser WEB Space</title><content type="html">Andere haben Werbebanner in gratis Web Spaces vorgesehen.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="52504"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>52538</id><published>2008-08-18T21:58:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-08-18T21:58:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Serializable XmlDocument</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;Updated 9 Oct 2008:&lt;/i&gt; replaced my custom MemoryStream.CopyUpToSeekPointer() extension method with MemoryStream.ToArray(), a built in method on MemoryStream that I overlooked and should have been using)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's surprising that XmlDocument isn't marked [Serializable], because it's very natural to serialize one into a stream. I wanted to put an object into ASP.NET ViewState the other day, and quickly ran into this roadblock, because part of the object included an XmlDocument, which is not serializable. A quick search revealed that most people deal with this problem by storing a string instead. Indeed, that was where I started, but I quickly realized that there are multiple places in my code where I want to do this sort of thing, and I don't want to have to mess with it in each data structure that contains an XmlDocument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I put together a simple class that holds an XmlDocument and implements ISerializable and called it SerializableXmlDocument. I'm sharing the source code here in the hopes that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) somebody will find it useful, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) somebody smarter than I am will point out how I screwed it up and help me make it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SerializableXmlDocument includes implicit conversion operators to make it easy to convert to/from an XmlDocument. It holds the actual document in a property called Value. This "isomorph" pattern is one that I picked up from &lt;a target="_blank" href="/community/blogs/craig/default.aspx"&gt;Craig&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is SerializableXmlDocument.cs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; System;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; System.Runtime.Serialization;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; System.Xml;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; System.IO;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; Pluralsight.Samples&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    [Serializable]&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; SerializableXmlDocument : ISerializable&lt;br /&gt;    {&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; SerializableXmlDocument() { }&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; SerializableXmlDocument(XmlDocument &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;        {&lt;br /&gt;            &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.Value = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; XmlDocument Value { get; set; }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;span class="preproc"&gt;#region&lt;/span&gt; ISerializable implementation&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...and here's a sample object that uses SerializableXmlDocument:&lt;/p&gt;

I think your way is best if you are only ever going to have to serialize one non-Serializable type.  But if you are going to have more than one I think it makes sense to go down the ISerializationSurrogate route.

&lt;p&gt;Yep my original goal was to use the serialization surrogate infrastructure. The problem I ran into with ViewState is that I couldn't find any way to register a surrogate selector - perhaps it exists, but I didn't find it in my searches. Reading your blog post makes it clear that WF exposes a way to chain in a surrogate selector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So SerializableXmlDocument fills in the gaps when you can't register a surrogate selector.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="52538"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>52601</id><published>2008-08-19T10:03:43.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-08-19T10:03:43.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Serializable XmlDocument</title><content type="html">Oh yea - that's true.

[Serializable]
public class SerializableXmlDocument : XmlDocument, ISerializable
{
	public SerializableXmlDocument()
	{
	}
	protected SerializableXmlDocument(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)
	{
		this.InnerXml = info.GetString("XML");

Indeed controls like the TextBox have code in them that allows you to set the Text property to null and the TextBox will convert that into an empty string. So it's a bit counterintuitive that &lt;em&gt;the declarative data source works the opposite way by default&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you use a declarative data source to perform a parameterized update that contains string parameters, consider setting ConvertEmptyStringToNull='false' on your &amp;lt;asp:Parameter&amp;gt; elements, because &lt;em&gt;it's true by default&lt;/em&gt;! In other words, if a text field contains an empty string, it'll be sent to your declarative data source not as string.Empty, but as null.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now I don't know about you, but I don't like dealing with nulls if I can avoid it. Especially strings. Unless there's a clear need to have a null state, I avoid them like the plague not only in my database designs but also in my XML schema designs.

I would set the ErrorMessage to something vanilla like, "This field is required", or even something simpler like "*" (an asterisk) if I didn't have much room on the form to display more prose for an error.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A friend was recently testing a new feature that I'd built for our sales team and she had a hard time seeing the little red asterisks that were showing up next to required fields. It felt to her as though she was pushing the submit button on the form but nothing was happening. It was clear that a ValidationSummary control would be helpful, especially if placed close to the submit button for the form.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've been a bit lazy in the past about using ValidationSummary controls, partially because most of my forms are simple enough that they feel a bit redundant. But on a more complicated form, they can be very helpful to guide users back to the places on the form where there's problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I threw one of those puppies on the form and immediately saw that there was a problem - my error message was set to "*", which meant that my validation summary was pretty useless - it just displayed a bunch of red asterisks! And in places where I'd used the prose, "This field is required", well that was pretty useless as an error message in the summary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After a bit of research and experimentation, I discovered that the ValidationSummary control looks at the ErrorMessage property on each validation control in order to figure out what to display in the summary. So it's important to use ErrorMessage with a summary in mind! Don't use text like "*" or "This field is required". Be more specific so the user can find her way up to the problem field, as in, "PostalCode is required".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if you make ErrorMessage verbose so that it's helpful in a summary, it may make your form really ugly when displayed inline next to the control being validated. The trick is to use the body of the validation control element to specify the inline error message. Then you end up with two messages: a verbose one that's used in your summary, and a more localized, brief message that shows up right next to the control being validated. Note the asterisk that's in the body of the RequiredFieldValidator below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;asp:RequiredFieldValidator&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="attr"&gt;ErrorMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;="Zip/postal code is required"&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="attr"&gt;ControlToValidate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;='txtPostalCode'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="attr"&gt;ValidationGroup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;='BasicInfo'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="attr"&gt;Display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;="Dynamic"&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="attr"&gt;runat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;='server'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;*&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;asp:RequiredFieldValidator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've learned a lesson from all of this. In the future when I use validation controls I'll always provide a summary-friendly message in the ErrorMessage field, and if I need something different (typically shorter) to display inline, I'll put it in the body of the validation control element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>52820</id><published>2008-09-03T17:08:29.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-09-03T17:08:29.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: A tip on using ASP.NET validation controls</title><content type="html">Or you can use the Text property.

He used to call my security class, "Essential Access Denied". His point was a good one: when they aren't applied carefully, security countermeasures often just get in the way of getting work done. I don't know about you, but password-mode text boxes in web forms have always been one of those annoyances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm not complaining about the fact that I can't see what I'm typing. I understand and laud that feature, because I don't want someone looking over my shoulder at the password I'm typing, and this even applies when I'm at home. I love my children, but I certainly don't want them knowing the password to my bank account!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No, what I'm bothered by is how a typical password text box behaves on a form that may incur multiple post-backs before it's finally submitted. If you use the built in ASP.NET TextBox control, it purposely does not repopulate the password text, which means if you press a button on the form that performs a post-back, or if you have a multi-page form that posts back on every step, that password disappears, and the user typically has to re-enter it. You could solve this with liberal use of ASP.NET Ajax UpdatePanels, but that adds its own complexities. I wanted a simpler solution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I did a little research to see what others had discovered about this problem, and I ended up deriving my own custom control from TextBox to make a much more user-friendly (and developer-friendly) TextBox control. I called it PasswordTextBox, and it acts just like a TextBox in password mode, but it retains the password while still giving the user the same level of protection the standard TextBox supplies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My PasswordTextBox operates very simply: it stores the password in control state, and renders a series of fixed characters (with the same length as the actual password) into the text box so that it "looks" like the user's password has been rendered. Since control state is part of view state, and since view state is stored in a hidden field on the form, I encrypt the password before putting it into control state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The result is quite nice - the user can post your form back as many times as she needs to, perhaps moving back and forth across wizard steps or tabs, and when she finally presses the "Finish" button (or whatever you call the last step of your input form), your code will be able to read the password by simply accessing the Text property on the PasswordTextBox. The user will believe that her password is sitting there on the form while she's working, as the same number of obfuscated characters will show up in the field as she typed in originally (what she doesn't know is that those characters aren't her real password anymore, but what she doesn't know won't hurt her!)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note that to keep this simple, I used DPAPI to encrypt the password, which suited my purposes. But if you have a web farm, that won't work well at all if you don't know which machine the user's going to post back to, so you'll want to replace that with something more robust. I could see looking up the &amp;lt;machineKey&amp;gt; for entropy, as that tends to be sync'd already across the farm, but I've not yet spent the cycles to go down that road, since unfortunately all of the code for generating keys based on that config section are off limits in ASP.NET (most of the useful stuff is marked internal). I don't think it'd be that hard to do though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, without further ado, here's the code, which you'll see is quite simple. I'd love feedback, especially if you see any glaring problems with the idea or the implementation!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; PasswordTextBox : TextBox
{
    &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// unlikely that a string of these would be used for a password&lt;/span&gt;

Well, I finally found out how to fix this. I called 888.528.8460, which is their "privacy preference line". From there I was able to opt out of all solicitation for new services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We'll see how well it works.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm not a crazy environmentalist, but waste makes me cringe. I make it a habit to contact companies that mail me catalogs that I don't read, telling them to take me off of their lists. I also do little things like bring a couple of bags to the grocery store every time I go in order to avoid generating more plastic waste.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other day, I was buying my son a sweatshirt in T.J. Maxx, and the clerk popped it into a plastic bag. I said, "Thanks, but I really don't need that bag." He promptly balled it up and threw it in the trash. It makes me sad how so many people just don't get it.

But over here in the UK supermarkets have recently begun a policy of not handing out bags for your shopping, if you want / need some you have to explicitly ask for them. Some of them even provide extra loyalty points if you bring your own carriers when you shop.
A small step, but we only get anywhere in small steps don't we?

About your term "loosely affiliated companies" - there's no such thing, a company is an affiliate of the bank or it not. There are separate privacy laws that regulate sharing of customer information with affiliates and with non-affiliated third parties; and these two forms of sharing have separate opt-outs. You said that in your call to the bank's privacy office, you opted out of "all solicitation" so perhaps you did get both covered.

As someone who deals with banks on a daily basis, I have to clarify Laura's statements - the banks do, and will explicitly share this information with these affiliate companies, but they're doing so through a known policy.  I believe the bank was stating the "loosely affiliated companies" as being these affiliates, rather than their "in shop" marketing, such as their recent attempts to sell me a "personal banking assistant" for $5.95/mo for the last three weeks.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="54177"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>56631</id><published>2009-02-06T13:19:07.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-02-06T13:19:07.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Wells Fargo Opt Out 800 Number</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think it is ridiculous that you have to "opt out" of being harrased by telemarketers affiliated with Wells Fargo.  If they really valued their customers they would not share our information with companies who will torment us with phone calls trying to sell us worthless products.  Their privacy policy states that they do not share their customers' information but in the next line it says they will share it in order to market Wells Fargo pruducts and services.  So does this mean that Wells Fargo owns AIG and similar companies?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="54177"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>55244</id><published>2008-11-26T07:41:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-26T07:41:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Zermatt is now Geneva Framework</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For those who didn't attend PDC, the &lt;a href="/community/blogs/keith/archive/2008/07/09/introducing-microsoft-code-name-zermatt.aspx"&gt;Zermatt identity framework&lt;/a&gt; has been re-code-named Geneva Framework so that it fits in with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/geneva"&gt;Geneva family of products&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

This system &lt;a target="_blank" href="/community/blogs/keith/archive/2008/08/04/better-exception-reporting-in-asp-net-part-2.aspx"&gt;sends email&lt;/a&gt; to the devs when exceptions occur so that they can track down the problem. Their website is constantly getting better as they strive to reduce those emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works great when the exception is unhandled. The ASP.NET infrastructure logs these automatically. But what about an exception that you trap and recover from? A classic example is SmtpException. An email failure can happen at any time - perhaps you temporarily lose your connection to the mail server, or perhaps you try to send mail to a local mailbox that doesn't exist anymore. But you might not want to let that exception go unhandled, so you stick a try/catch in there, swallow the exception, and then feel bad because the devs will no longer get notified about those problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself in that situation recently, so I figured instead of just swallowing the exception, I'd raise the same WebEvent that ASP.NET raises when an exception goes unhandled, putting a note in there that we trapped this exception. The event that would normally be raised is WebRequestErrorEvent, which conveniently includes details about the request that was being processed when the error occurred. But this class doesn't have any public constructors - you can't use it directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did the obvious thing: derived my own event class from the one I wanted to use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; RecoveredWebRequestErrorEvent : WebRequestErrorEvent
{
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; RecoveredWebRequestErrorEvent(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; message, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; eventSource, Exception exception)
        : &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;(message, eventSource, (&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;)MyEventCodes.RecoveredException, exception)
    {
    }
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the use of an enumeration for event codes - it's a good habit to get into, so that you'll have your codes in one place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; MyEventCodes : &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;
{
    Foo = WebEventCodes.WebExtendedBase + 1,
    Bar,
    RecoveredException,
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;&lt;!--
.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
	font-size: small;
	color: black;
	font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;
	background-color: #ffffff;
	/*white-space: pre;*/
}
.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }
.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }
.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }
.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }
.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }
.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }
.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }
.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }
.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }
.csharpcode .alt 
{
	background-color: #f4f4f4;
	width: 100%;
	margin: 0em;
}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }
--&gt;&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is the code where I trap the exception and log the error. Easy huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;
{
    SendEmail();
}
&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; (SmtpException x)
{
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; RecoveredWebRequestErrorEvent(&lt;span class="str"&gt;"Trapped and recovered from an SmtpException"&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;                                      &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;, x).Raise();
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that I get the same details I would as if this exception had gone unhandled (the stack trace is helpful for finding exactly where in the code the problem occurred). I can filter on this event code (RecoveredException) if I want to, and the message makes it clear that the exception was trapped, and did not go unhandled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>56265</id><published>2009-01-18T11:31:54.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-01-18T11:31:54.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Logging trapped exceptions with ASP.NET health monitoring</title><content type="html">Keith -  Cool stuff.  We have a web product deployed to several large customers that leverage HealthMonitoring in this way extensively.  We follow a similar pattern as you, with "codes" and "categories."  It's really great at identifying issues before our customers necessarily notice them.  

IMO HealthMonitoring doesn't get enough publicity -- it's what makes manageability possible in scale.  It's great that you can log the WebEvets to SQL Server (aspnet_regsql will create the right DBMS) as well as Email, the Windows Event Log, etc.

There's a Health Monitoring glitch for IIS7 / integrated-pipeline usage that I think MS may address.  When used in an Application_Start handler, WebErrorEvent.Raise throws an exception because it tries to access the HttpContext.Request (which does not exist in Application_Start).  

Until a fix is out, you can work around it by temporarily setting HttpContext.Current to null for the duration of your event-handler.  The WebErrorEvent handles that case gracefully.

&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of years, I've worked on websites that support both HTTP and HTTPS, and it's always tricky to find a balance between security and usability. &lt;a href="http://www.leastprivilege.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Dominick&lt;/a&gt; wrote &lt;a href="http://www.leastprivilege.com/PartiallySSLSecuredWebAppsWithASPNET.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;an excellent article&lt;/a&gt; about this awhile back, suggesting that allowing ASP.NET to make the choice between HTTP and HTTPS makes a website more friendly. He wrote a little class called SslTools that did the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's generally safer and much less tricky to get security right when you run your entire website over SSL. But if you do choose to go the mixed route and allow HTTP vs. HTTPS access depending on the page (or section of the site), I strongly recommend that you take a few minutes to read Dominick's original article, &lt;a href="http://www.leastprivilege.com/PartiallySSLSecuredWebAppsWithASPNET.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Partial SSL Secured Web Apps with ASP.NET&lt;/a&gt;. He shows how you can ensure that login cookies are only sent over SSL (prevents eavesdroppers from hijacking logon sessions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So naturally when I wanted to implement this, I grabbed Dominick's SslTools class and started using it. Since Dominick made his original post, I've rewritten and improved his class substantially, so much that I have created a new version of it called SslHelper. The major features that I wanted to add were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Preserves your HTTP port (helps when running in VS.NET debug environment on alternate HTTP port)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Better support for relative URIs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Support for App-relative URIs (e.g., ~/default.aspx)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Support for unit testing outside of ASP.NET&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Make it easy to turn off SSL for the entire website (for debugging)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Uses System.Uri in the interface (FxCop friendly)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told Dominick that I was going to publish this class once I had a chance to extensively test it, and it seemed there for awhile that every month I would either find a bug or a feature that I wanted to add, so I've waited until now to publish it. It's been rock solid for me and is being used in live websites for quite some time now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a couple of places you'll want to use this class: early in the ASP.NET pipeline to ensure the use of HTTP or HTTPS on particular pages, and anywhere else you want to get an absolute URL that uses a particular scheme (HTTP or HTTPS). The latter is particularly useful when you want to include a link to a web page in an email sent by your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of how you might use this class in global.asax to redirect users to the appropriate scheme (HTTP or HTTPS) depending on the section of your website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;SslHelper sslHelper = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; SslHelper();&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (Request.Path.StartsWith(Request.ApplicationPath&lt;br /&gt;                            + &lt;span class="str"&gt;"/internal/"&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;        StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase))&lt;br /&gt;    sslHelper.EnsureHTTPS();&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; sslHelper.EnsureHTTP();&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have this code in place, you can easily turn off SSL for debugging without changing your code. Just add an appSetting called "EnableSSL", with a value of "false", and SslHelper will notice this and will use HTTP for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example that gives you a URI that you can use in an email message, or as a navigate URL. Note that you can use tilde syntax for convenience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;Uri target = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Uri(&lt;span class="str"&gt;"~/login/UserHome.aspx"&lt;/span&gt;, UriKind.Relative);&lt;br /&gt;Uri sslTarget = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; SslHelper().GetAbsoluteUri(target, ProtocolOptions.Https);&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, I've extensively used, debugged, and improved this class, so it should be immediately useful. Feel free to use it in your own projects without worry about licensing. If you'd attribute the original work to Dominick and myself as in the comments below, I would appreciate it. The usual caveats apply - use at your own risk!&lt;/p&gt;

And what's great is that I've been able to round out my knowledge by watching a few modules of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/main/instructor.aspx?name=scott-allen"&gt;Scott Allen&lt;/a&gt;'s most excellent &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/main/olt/Course.aspx?n=linq-fundamentals"&gt;online Linq class&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've found it very helpful to gather statistics using aggregate functions like Count and Sum, but Sum doesn't work with TimeSpan objects out of the box. And our system uses TimeSpan in a number of places. The solution? Just hack up your own aggregating Linq operator:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; System;
&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; System.Collections.Generic;
&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; System.Linq;

&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; Pluralsight.LinqOperators
{
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; CustomLinqOperators
    {
        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; TimeSpan Sum&amp;lt;TSource&amp;gt;(
            &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; IEnumerable&amp;lt;TSource&amp;gt; source,
            Func&amp;lt;TSource, TimeSpan&amp;gt; selector)
        {
            TimeSpan total = TimeSpan.Zero;

            &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;foreach&lt;/span&gt; (TSource item &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; source)
                total += selector(item);

            &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; total;
        }
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's some code that computes the total length of Pluralsight On-Demand! content. Note the squiggly when I try to sum the Duration field for all of our video clips, which is a TimeSpan. The compiler is trying to find a conversion to one of the types supported by the standard Sum operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as soon as I add a using statement for Pluralsight.LinqOperators, the squiggly goes away and the code works as expected.

I got it working pretty quickly in a test website, and it works quite nicely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So now I'm a bit curious. There's a section in the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb288408.aspx"&gt;Introduction to Windows Live ID&lt;/a&gt; that talks about, "what kind of claims can a Windows Live ID contain?", and it mentioned a bunch of different things, including the user's email address. As far as I can tell, all I get when I authenticate a user over WLID is a unique identifier that looks something like this: 36c4f92ed3a5f8c6c2fc889d9dff9ee8.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking at the data structure that the SDK uses to represent a user, I haven't been able to find anything that looks like a collection of claims. So I'm not sure I understand why the introduction talks about claims like it does. I'd love to learn how to get (with the user's consent) her first name, last name, and email address. But I'm not sure if that's even possible with the WLID SDK.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I thought that I might be able to get this information via delegated authentication, but looking at the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://dev.live.com/blogs/liveid/archive/2008/02/25/211.aspx"&gt;Delegated Authentication Resource Provider Directory&lt;/a&gt;, I see that I can ask the user for consent to read/write her contacts list, photos, and application storage, but nothing about discovering additional claims about the user, such as her email address or first name.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm sure I'm missing something...&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>57620</id><published>2009-03-11T23:37:05.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-03-11T23:37:05.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Experimenting with Windows Live ID SDK</title><content type="html">I don't think you are -- we've had the same discussion in local Azure user group meetings.

So here's a GUI-based tool that uses a combination of the .NET Framework and the CryptoAPI to create self-signed X.509 certificates. And it's factored so that you can use the underlying library standalone - you can easily create certs programmatically now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the GUI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/community/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/keith/self_2D00_cert.png"&gt;&lt;img height="340" width="457" border="0" src="/community/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/keith/self_2D00_cert_5F00_thumb.png" alt="self-cert" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GUI has some nifty features: you can create a PFX file directly, or you can save directly to a cert store of your choice. When you save to a cert store, an extra dialog pops up showing you where the private key file resides, so that you can adjust the ACL accordingly. I've got a "view private key" feature that launches explorer with the /select argument. That is supposed to run explorer and select the file so you can find it easily, but that particular feature isn't working on my box at the moment (let me know if it works for you). Anyway, this extra dialog gives you some quick info you typically want, like the thumbprint. And there are buttons for browsing the cert store and viewing the certificate as well from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/community/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/keith/self_2D00_cert_2D00_3.png"&gt;&lt;img height="206" width="562" border="0" src="/community/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/keith/self_2D00_cert_2D00_3_5F00_thumb.png" alt="self-cert-3" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GUI gens the RSA key pair on a background thread, so a) the app doesn't lock up on you, and b) if you get tired of waiting for the key to gen, you can cancel easily enough :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/community/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/keith/self_2D00_cert_2D00_2.png"&gt;&lt;img height="158" width="244" border="0" src="/community/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/keith/self_2D00_cert_2D00_2_5F00_thumb.png" alt="self-cert-2" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's some code that does this programmatically by calling the Pluralsight.Crypto library that is underneath all of this. I figure I'll expand this library as I find other CryptoAPI things that I want to do easily from .NET that I can't today. Those of you who are familiar with the CryptoAPI will recognize the key abstraction here :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; GenSelfSignedCert()
{
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; (CryptContext ctx = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; CryptContext())
    {
        ctx.Open();

        X509Certificate2 cert = ctx.CreateSelfSignedCertificate(
            &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; SelfSignedCertProperties
            {
                IsPrivateKeyExportable = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;,
                KeyBitLength = 4096,
                Name = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; X500DistinguishedName(&lt;span class="str"&gt;"cn=localhost"&lt;/span&gt;),
                ValidFrom = DateTime.Today.AddDays(-1),
                ValidTo = DateTime.Today.AddYears(1),
            });

        X509Certificate2UI.DisplayCertificate(cert);
    }
}&lt;/pre&gt;

I updated the code to use AT_KEYEXCHANGE, but unfortunately the problem persists even with certs created that way. The event log says, "The server certificate for instance '1' does not chain up to a trusted root certificate.".

Naturally I've tried copying the cert into the LocalMachine/TrustedRootCA store, which makes the cert show up without a red "X" on it in the Certificates snap-in, but that doesn't help IIS like it any more.

I'm curious if anyone has ever had any luck using a cert built with CryptoAPI's CertCreateSelfSignCertificate in IIS, given its lack of a AKI extension...</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="56427"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>56438</id><published>2009-01-27T11:48:10.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-01-27T11:48:10.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Self-Cert and IIS</title><content type="html">Dang.

He was concerned that a website that he frequents wasn't doing such a good job storing passwords. He pointed out that by clicking a button, you could get your password emailed back to you. After talking with someone at the website, he discovered that at least the website wasn't storing passwords in cleartext, but they were instead encrypting those passwords and storing the ciphertext.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mike's concern about this makes sense. When you build a website that accepts passwords, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000953.html"&gt;you are taking on a huge responsibility&lt;/a&gt;, because you need to remember that many people tend to use the same password everywhere. So if you store the user's name, email address, and password, and if your password database is compromised, your users might be in danger of having their bank accounts, etc. compromised. This is really scary stuff, and I've never envied developers who are in the position of building and maintaining such user account databases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are some things you can do to help protect your users if you are storing their passwords:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1) Store the passwords using a strong, cryptographic &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA_hash_functions"&gt;one way hash&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.sha256.aspx"&gt;SHA-256&lt;/a&gt;. And use a long, random, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt; value unique to each user. This will slow down a dictionary attack if someone is able to steal your password database.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2) Ensure that your website doesn't allow &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001206.html"&gt;unlimited failed login attempts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3) Implement a password policy that is strong enough for the level of security you need. Accepting three character passwords is just silly (the site Mike pointed me to allowed that, by the way). The higher value the website, the longer and more &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength"&gt;complex&lt;/a&gt; your passwords should be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4) Consider stretching the password by hashing and rehashing that hash, N times. PKCS #5 is an example of this, and there's a class in the .NET Framework that makes this trivial: &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.rfc2898derivebytes.aspx"&gt;System.Security.Cryptography::Rfc2898DeriveBytes&lt;/a&gt;. This allows you to increase the strength of your password hash over time (by increasing N), so that Moore's law isn't only working in the attacker's favor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There's no excuse for websites not to do at least (1) and (2).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(3) and (4) are important considerations for higher security websites, but then you should be asking yourself, why am I using passwords to protect a high security website?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What's the ultimate solution to this problem? Instead of storing a password for a user, in the future it'll be &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/aa570351.aspx"&gt;much easier&lt;/a&gt; to  &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163520.aspx"&gt;federate&lt;/a&gt; with an identity provider that can deal with all the hard issues of client authentication. But if you're not ready for that, there are still other alternatives, such as using SSL client certificates or &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Card"&gt;information cards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>56455</id><published>2009-01-28T06:50:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-01-28T06:50:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Link Listing - January 27, 2009</title><content type="html">ASP.NET RedirectButton - Redirect Users With the Click of a Button [Via: 4 Guys from Rolla ] ASP.NET...</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="56441"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>56628</id><published>2009-02-06T09:11:02.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-02-06T09:11:02.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Periodic Digest of Interesting Stuff</title><content type="html">Periodic Digest of Interesting Stuff</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="56441"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>56459</id><published>2009-01-28T12:45:07.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-01-28T12:45:07.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">My quest to programmatically generate a self-signed cert that makes IIS happy</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently published &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/keith/archive/2009/01/22/create-self-signed-x-509-certificates-in-a-flash-with-self-cert.aspx"&gt;Self-Cert&lt;/a&gt;, a tool that makes it really easy to generate self-signed certificates using the CryptoAPI. What's nice about it is that it has a .NET class library underneath it that makes it easy to do this programmatically from managed code as well. The code is currently using &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa376039(VS.85).aspx"&gt;CertCreateSelfSignCertificate&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems to work great, except that IIS refuses to set up an SSL session using one of my certs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After quite a bit of experimenting and searching, I determined that the problem didn't have anything to do with my cert creation code, but rather it had to do with the way I was importing the resulting certificate into the certificate store. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The details are still not entirely clear to me, although I've fixed the problem based on a comment left by &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/David.Wang/"&gt;David Wang&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://groups.google.pt/group/microsoft.public.inetserver.iis.security/browse_thread/thread/07ba74d06dd0e673"&gt;a question posed on an IIS newsgroup&lt;/a&gt;. Two lines of code was all it took for the fix, right before I call X509Store.Add to add the cert. I export it to a PFX blob, then reimport it with a flag that indicates where the private key is stored:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;[] pfx = cert.Export(X509ContentType.Pfx);
cert = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; X509Certificate2(pfx, (&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;,
    X509KeyStorageFlags.PersistKeySet |
    X509KeyStorageFlags.MachineKeySet);&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes the code work, though this feels a bit like cheating. If you know a more elegant solution, let me know, and I'll incorporate it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've updated &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/keith.SampleCode/SelfCert.zip"&gt;the bits&lt;/a&gt; with this fix, and added a version number. This fix brought it up to version 1.1.0.0.&lt;/p&gt;

Oh, and I also noticed that coding legend &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/main/instructor.aspx?name=fritz-onion"&gt;Fritz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/fritz/default.aspx"&gt;Onion&lt;/a&gt; is now &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/fritzonion/status/1191616891"&gt;searching for keyboard stickers&lt;/a&gt; for his &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/input/8396/?cpg=ab"&gt;blank keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, so I figured I'd save myself some grief. I learned to program on a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard"&gt;clicky IBM keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, and it was, well, delightful to use. I'm looking forward to getting back to basics!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>56677</id><published>2009-02-10T08:01:58.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-02-10T08:01:58.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Back to basics</title><content type="html">Keith, you'll have to let me know how you like it.

I'm not talking about how a user manages the myriad of passwords she's stuck with, but rather how a system (e.g., a website) should go about accepting, storing, and protecting the password she chooses to use with that system. Face it. &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://boingboing.net/2008/11/26/passwords-suck.html"&gt;Passwords suck&lt;/a&gt;. But in reality, we're going to be stuck with them for awhile, and it'd be nice to have some better guidance for people building systems that must manage them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What motivates an attacker to want to know someone's password?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;1. Penetrate that system - by gaining control over a user's account, an attacker gains a foothold, the depth of which is usually dependent on the level of privilege of the compromised account.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2. Glean knowledge about the user's password - this could lead to attacks against other systems where the user has similar passwords.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3. &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack"&gt;Denial of service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm nervous about storing people's passwords. And you should be too. So my main consideration in this little series of articles is going to focus on (2). Discovering &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information"&gt;PII&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10789_3-10053523-57.html"&gt;can&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft"&gt;be&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.securityfocus.com/news/6353"&gt;profitable&lt;/a&gt;, and I want to build systems that make this as hard as possible for the bad guys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's two avenues of attack at a typical website:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A. The system's internal password store.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;B. An anonymously-accessible login page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The store (A) should be &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://alt.pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.GuideBook/WhatIsACountermeasure.html"&gt;protected&lt;/a&gt; so that an attacker cannot read it (2) or modify it (1, 3). And if an attacker does manage to read the store, it would be helpful if the store itself wouldn't immediately divulge its secrets. You can strengthen a password store against &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking"&gt;offline attack&lt;/a&gt; by "&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)"&gt;salting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.schneier.com/paper-low-entropy.html"&gt;stretching&lt;/a&gt;" passwords with &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163958.aspx"&gt;techniques&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2"&gt;PBKDF2&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2898"&gt;PKCS#5&lt;/a&gt;. This protection serves to slow down an offline attack, but likely won't prevent him from eventually discovering at least some user passwords. At this point your main protection is the strength of your &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_policy"&gt;password policy&lt;/a&gt; - if you allow short passwords, or easy-to-guess passwords, it'll not take long for an attacker to discover them. You could go as far as performing your own dictionary attack against a proposed password before accepting it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can further strengthen your own website by &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://alt.pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.GuideBook/WhatIsACountermeasure.html"&gt;detecting&lt;/a&gt; such a breach and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://alt.pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.GuideBook/WhatIsACountermeasure.html"&gt;reacting&lt;/a&gt; by forcing users to reset their passwords by authenticating using a stronger, less convenient means. But those countermeasures aren't going to matter if the attacker's motivation is (2).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'd hazard a guess that the vast majority of ASP.NET systems out there that store passwords are using SqlMembershipProvider, which does provide some basic protections like salt, but does not stretch passwords at all. It does provide some rudimentary methods for requiring strong passwords, but certainly doesn't attempt a dictionary attack against them. And the password reset mechanism is very, very weak by default - supply your own question and answer? Don't get me &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/keith/archive/2006/05/24/24964.aspx"&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; on that! "What &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.goodsecurityquestions.com/"&gt;color&lt;/a&gt; is the sky?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So readers, what am I missing in my analysis so far?

But we're stuck with them for awhile. This &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/keith/archive/2009/02/21/towards-smarter-password-management-part-1.aspx"&gt;little series of articles&lt;/a&gt; is my attempt to explore how you can implement a password store and login page that &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Wobegon_Days"&gt;makes the best of it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A typical web app that has a user name/password store typically has two points of entry for an attacker:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A. The system's internal password store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;B. An anonymously-accessible login page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/keith/archive/2009/02/21/towards-smarter-password-management-part-1.aspx"&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, I shared some thoughts about (A), and this part will focus on (B).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are a modest list of goals for a good login page. Do you concur?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal 1: Prevent online password-guessing attacks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the biggie. Imagine an attacker running automated &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking"&gt;dictionary and brute force attacks&lt;/a&gt; against your user store from the comfort and safety of his home in (insert name of impossible-to-prosecute-in foreign country) from the hundreds of machines on his personal &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet"&gt;zombie bot net&lt;/a&gt;. I've seen lots of articles that talk about the &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to achieve this goal, and some even offer rudimentary suggestions on how it might be done. I'm hoping to take a broader view of the topic and get to a solution that addresses more than just this one goal. And I plan to follow up with code that you can use in your ASP.NET websites.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal 2: Prevent information leaks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Login pages are inherently risky. For some websites, this may be the only page accessible to anonymous users. And a login page provides a direct entry point to a highly valuable resource: your user account store. So you want to be very careful to design your login page so that it doesn't leak information. The most obvious example of unintended information leakage is accidentally validating user names for the bad guy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;User names aren't typically considered secret, but there's no point making it easy for an attacker to collect a list of valid user names at your website. Knowing a valid user name just gives the attacker a target for a password guessing attack, or fodder for a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Deception"&gt;social engineering attack&lt;/a&gt;. A simple example of a login page that doesn't meet this goal is one that has a different error message depending on whether the user provided a valid user name or not. Say, &lt;em&gt;invalid user name&lt;/em&gt;, as opposed to the more vague &lt;em&gt;invalid user name or password&lt;/em&gt;. This fights against usability, but it's a pretty reasonable tradeoff for most sites. A more subtle violation is where an attacker can use a side channel such as timing to determine a valid user name. If (as I discussed in &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/keith/archive/2009/02/21/towards-smarter-password-management-part-1.aspx"&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;) you are using an iterative hash to validate a password, but you only perform this lengthy computation if the user supplies a valid user name, then the attacker may be able to tell the difference between a good and bad user name by keeping stats on how long it takes for your login page to return a response.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similarly it would be bad if the page leaked information about the privilege level of a user, because when the website is the target of attack, high privilege user accounts are the juiciest targets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal 3: Prevent client-side capture.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many browsers offer to remember passwords for the user. I could write an entire article on the plusses and minuses of stored passwords, but I think we all agree that on shared computers (think Internet Cafe) we would rather that the user NOT store her password in the browser. If there's a keylogger on the box, her password is already compromised as soon as she types it, but there's no point inviting attack by leaving stored passwords in the browser as well (one of the evils of passwords is that they have long lifetimes).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you ever noticed that some websites don't work so well with browser-stored passwords? It's like the browser doesn't recognize the password field (and often the user name as well). Knowing how to do this seems like it'd be a good tool in your bag of login page tricks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal 4: Do all of this without introducing Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You don't want to end up with a login page that makes it easy for an attacker to prevent legitimate users from logging in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal 5: Do all of this while keeping your login page easy to use for legitimate users.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your login page is hard to use, your customers will hate you. This is not good from a business or a security standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you agree with the goals I've listed here? Am I missing anything?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next up, we'll look at some random bits of advice that I've found during my research, and see how they help achieve these goals. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>57633</id><published>2009-03-12T09:13:47.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-03-12T09:13:47.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Welcome Eric Burke</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/main/instructor.aspx?name=Eric%20Burke"&gt;Eric&lt;/a&gt; is one of our newest instructors, and he’s got a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/eburke/"&gt;new blog on our website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here’s what he’s got to say about himself:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;“Eric Burke is a member of the technical staff at Pluralsight, where he focuses on &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/main/ilt/Course.aspx?id=AP15"&gt;WPF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/main/ilt/Course.aspx?id=AP19"&gt;Silverlight&lt;/a&gt;.

I wanted to explore this a bit, and found that browsers didn’t work well since these atom documents have xml content, not HTML content. So I hacked up a little feed browser that lets you navigate the structure of an AtomPub resource.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/keith/image_5F00_109342CD.png"&gt;&lt;img height="123" width="244" src="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/keith/image_5F00_thumb_5F00_1982D50C.png" alt="image" border="0" title="image" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Feed Browser is a very simple browser – you can type in the URL of an AtomPub resource and it’ll parse the resulting atom feed or entry and display it in two ways: in the left pane it displays a FlowDocument that includes hyperlinks for each &amp;lt;link&amp;gt; element, which allows you to navigate the structure of the resource using only HTTP GET. And in the right pane, it displays the raw XML for the feed or entry. I don’t make any attempt to parse the content of entries, but I found this tool helpful for poking around ACS, and you might find it helpful for looking at other browser-unfriendly AtomPub resources as well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/keith.SampleCode/FeedBrowser.zip"&gt;Here are the bits&lt;/a&gt;.

That article lists &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms996456.aspx"&gt;seven laws of identity&lt;/a&gt;, which make it clear that the user should be at the center whenever identity about her is revealed to a relying party. But over the last couple of years I’ve seen this term used in contexts that have nothing to do with putting the user at the center. Specifically I’m thinking of discussions of federated identity, typically used in a corporate setting, where WS-Federation is used to give members of an organization a single-sign on experience to their own resources and often resources in partner organizations (cross-org federation). In many of these cases, the user isn’t given any notice that her identity is being shared with a relying party. There’s usually no identity selector involved at all, and the user isn’t shown what attributes of her identity are being shared.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now in a corporate environment, when the user’s attributes are not personal (e.g., her SSN or credit card number isn’t being shared, rather her employee ID, groups that she’s in, etc. are being shared instead), who cares about putting the user at the center? It’s not necessary and would probably just annoy the user by adding an additional step (the user granting permission for these attributes to be shared).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But why do people still use the term, “Identity Metasystem” in this context? Just because we’re sending SAML tokens around using WS-Trust and WS-Fed (passive) doesn’t mean we satisfy the seven laws.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>62212</id><published>2009-05-08T00:09:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-05-08T00:09:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Is the Identity Metasystem user centric or not?</title><content type="html">Well - when you look here:

http://docs.oasis-open.org/imi/identity/v1.0/identity.html

The laws are not mentioned.

In my eyes the IMS is a guideline how to use existing technologies like WS-Trust and SAML to create interoperable environments (and btw WS-Fed is not part of that guideline).

The laws are something to keep in mind when implementing your" version" of your identity management system.

On the Internet, only application specific identity services (Live services themselves, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc) provide granular, user-decided sharing choices.  Even then, those are subject to the whim of changing corporate use policies over time.  3rd party identity systems are just too new in practice to provide for this in a way that application vendors are willing or able to incorporate into their technology and use policies.

So, going back to KC and CardSpace, a user might be expected to create multiple Windows Live ID's, one for each 'persona' the user might express on the Internet.  The same could be said of creating multiple identities on each social networking site.  Whether the browser-based login state mechanisms will get to the point of allowing different logins per-tab using the same identity provider or same application is another matter.

I have a feeling that just as any secure communications protocol beyond 1-way SSL has proven too complex for almost all Internet transactions, any use of 'claims' beyond login ID will take a long time to conceptually and practically take hold.  

Today, the only interoperable, widely deployed option available to the user is PKI certificates.  I simply acquire certificates representing my various 'personas', and each certificate carries only the attributes I'm willing to share under that persona.  If I purchase them from a big enough vendor, they are even recognized by most potential services out there.  Unfortunately, since PKI deployment/use on the Windows platform is only understood by a relative few, and securely getting my certificates sync'ed across my various devices is even less understood, nearly all application vendors looking to scale shy away from using client-certificate based identity solutions.</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="62133"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>62214</id><published>2009-05-08T07:16:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-05-08T07:16:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">New Federated Identity module by Keith Brown now live</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/main/instructor.aspx?name=keith-brown"&gt;Keith Brown&lt;/a&gt; has just published &lt;a href="/main/olt/Module.aspx?a=keith-brown&amp;amp;cn=dotnet35-fundamentals&amp;amp;n=federated-identity-zen"&gt;The Zen of Federated Identity&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href="/main/olt/Course.aspx?n=dotnet35-fundamentals"&gt;.NET 3.5 Fundamentals&lt;/a&gt; course.&lt;/p&gt;

In these scenarios it’s not her personal information being shared, but rather a corporate identity that’s attached to her because she works for a company, and part of her job includes sharing some of those claims with trusted partner organizations via federation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But outside of the corporate space, in the sphere of social apps for example, things become less clearcut. For example, let’s say you wanted to build a social application in the cloud that relies on the .NET Access Control Service (ACS) to provide some basic role-based access control features. And let’s say you support some big identity providers like Windows Live ID (WLID), and maybe others that will more than likely come along in the future. Now you’ve got a reasonably complex federation scenario, where WLID (say) authenticates the user, provides claims about the user to ACS, which transforms those claims into something your app can use. How would you put the user in the center? Doesn’t the user need to authorize which claims WLID divulges to ACS? And then further, which claims ACS divulges to the app?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s interesting that today WLID doesn’t issue claims from the user’s WLID profile. It’d sure be nice to be able to get the user’s given name and surname, for example. The only claim WLID supports seems to be the user’s ID (the email address she uses to sign-in to WLID). I wonder how WLID will ever support more than that in a federation scenario like I describe here? How would WLID know to trust ACS with the user’s profile info, given that ACS may pass this info to any other app? How does the user know that ACS (or any other intermediate issuer) is trustworthy enough to handle her personal information? While the user probably trusts the application to some extent, it seems ludicrous to ask her if she trusts some intermediary like ACS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is one of the tensions that helped push CardSpace v2 away from user centricity. But more on that in another post.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>63002</id><published>2009-05-19T21:50:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-05-19T21:50:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Second Federated Identity module by Keith Brown now live</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/main/instructor.aspx?name=keith-brown"&gt;Keith Brown&lt;/a&gt; has just published &lt;a href="/main/olt/Module.aspx?a=keith-brown&amp;amp;cn=dotnet35-fundamentals&amp;amp;n=geneva-beta2-demos"&gt;Geneva Framework and Server in action&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href="/main/olt/Course.aspx?n=dotnet35-fundamentals"&gt;.NET 3.5 Fundamentals&lt;/a&gt; course.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>63113</id><published>2009-05-20T11:41:07.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-05-20T11:41:07.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">CardSpace v2 moving into a new role?</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the first version of CardSpace (the one that shipped with Vista), the focus was on building an identity selector that put the user at the center of the transaction. With v2 on the horizon, it feels like the emphasis is changing. No longer do I hear talk about user centricity. Rather now the identity selector seems to be positioned as a user-friendly form of home realm discovery for federated identity scenarios. Indeed CardSpace Geneva doesn’t include support for personal cards at all (although &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/card/archive/2008/10/29/windows-cardspace-geneva-beta.aspx"&gt;the CardSpace blog indicates that this is coming&lt;/a&gt;). The new selector is smaller and quicker to use, and does not ask the user nearly as many questions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ruchi Bhargava, a dev lead on the Federated Identity team who currently leads the CardSpace team, has some enlightening comments in a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Identity/Ruchi-Bhargava-on-Windows-CardSpace-Geneva/"&gt;recent screencast&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve done my best to transcribe here some interesting tidbits that I found a little more than halfway through the screencast:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;“When we built CardSpace v1, our idea of CardSpace v1 was that we are going to have these users who are going to be very worried about security and very interested in identity. What we have realized is that, not really true, most users don't really care about identity, most users just want to get into an application. Really choosing an identity is just a step in getting to the application.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;In v1 we had a whole drama around the identity selection experience we had the secure desktop, which would take over the screen which would result in sometimes the user losing context in what they were trying to do…&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;…the mantra is we are trying to fix three things. We are trying to make our product lighter. We are trying to make our product faster. We are trying to make our product smaller...&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;...we've realized that we don't really want to be different from existing ways of using credentials and using identities. We actually want to use the same metaphors so that users understand them and are seeing them multiple times. We've tried to use CredUI, and we've gotten rid of a lot of the steps that you had to take to choose an identity. The number of clicks that you have to do are much much fewer now. It's a much faster experience for the user.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These changes will definitely make CardSpace more attractive to users, although it diverges from the original vision, which was all about getting the user involved in an “introduction &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2007/399"&gt;ceremony&lt;/a&gt;” to help a user decide if she wants to trust a relying party with her personal information. Apparently Microsoft has discovered that users are put off by ceremony and would rather just “get on with using the application”. Regardless of how you feel about this shift, it’s helpful to know that it’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>68346</id><published>2009-06-28T07:13:54.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-06-28T07:13:54.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: CardSpace v2 moving into a new role?</title><content type="html">Very interesting.

The ADFS Fed Server was an "STS", etc., until &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vbertocci/"&gt;Vittorio&lt;/a&gt; caught me doing that in a talk and slapped some sense into me. An STS is an implementation of WS-Trust, he said. It's not even present in passive scenarios!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;It was this comment that got me thinking, why the heck are we using the term "STS" anyway? Wouldn't it be simpler (and more accurate) to refer to a fed server as an "issuer"? I've since changed my approach and I find that people understand fed much easier when we stop using so much jargon. So I talk about issuers now, instead of STS. Because of all the existing literature out there, I still feel the need to explain what an STS is, but I point out that they can think "Issuer" whenever they see the term "STS" in existing literature.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;I now think of "STS" as an ugly term that isn't universally applicable (think passive scenarios, think Java issuers that implement the SAML protocols, and not WS-Trust). I'm convinced that the term "Issuer" is more broadly applicable and that we should leave the term "STS" to the realm of protocol implementors (thank you, WIF team!)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;Can I convince anyone writing articles to abandon the term STS and use "Issuer" instead?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;Can I convince the WIF team to rename the SecurityTokenService class to something like TokenIssuer?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;Will you join me in my effort?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;Flame away!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>70633</id><published>2009-07-17T09:43:19.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-07-17T09:43:19.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Issuer vs. STS</title><content type="html">My ideas regarding these issues are not yet stabilized. However:

1) I use the terms "Claims Provider" or "Claims transformer" when referring to abstract architectural elements.

2) I use the term "STS" when dealing with concrete systems that expose endpoints for the WS-Trust or the WS-Federation (passive requestors) (ch 13, the former "passive profile") protocols. Note that the term "STS" is not exclusive of the "active profile":
    a) The "Web (Passive) Requestors" chapter of WS-Federation uses the term "STS".
    b) The metadata elements for the "passive" endpoints also use the term "STS".

3) I also use "IP-STS" or "PDP-STS" to qualify the type of issued claims (identity claims vs. authorization claims). I really don't like the term "R-STS".

I think I may have misunderstood Vittorio's comments, but having switched to using Issuer instead of STS I've found that's it's easier for people to understand.

STS is a protocol implementor's term, and I think it could be used in that context. But I still think of an STS as just one piece of the puzzle - it's technically the endpoint you talk to in order to get a token. But it doesn't address the logic, policy, and administration features of an issuer as a whole. So why do we keep referring to issuers (or claims providers, etc.) as STS?

I really do think we should abandon the term STS to protocol wonks.</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="70376"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>70637</id><published>2009-07-17T16:43:17.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-07-17T16:43:17.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Issuer vs. STS</title><content type="html">1) Yes, I agree with you: event when the term STS is applicable (WS-* contexts), it is just one of the several parts that constitutes an "issuer".

2) However, I believe that in order to successfully design, implement, debug and deploy identity and access control systems, a certain degree of protocol "wonkiness" is necessary.

And perhaps I'm arguing a small point, but I'm just hoping to make the barrier to entry for folks building claims-aware apps a little lower by not having them worry so much about protocol details.

That's what WIF is for - to abstract them from that stuff. What's important to me from a pedagogical standpoint is that my audience understands the relationship between the user requesting a token, the issuer of that token, and the app that receives it. The fact that they need to trust the issuer, etc.

And there's a great example. What sounds more natural to you, "Trust your issuer" or "Trust your STS"? Funny how the latter sounds like technical jargon that I can ignore. The former almost feels to me like it puts a human face on the issuer, and gets me thinking about trust between businesses, etc. Cause there's a lot more to this story than just the crypto. The technical stuff is the easy part, right?

A lot of this is gut feel, but I've been talking about Issuer now about as long as I have STS, and I feel tons better using Issuer when giving a talk.

So why don't I use "Claims Provider"? Issuer has less syllables. Seriously. It's less to get your head around. It even has less syllables than STS. And certainly less than Security Token Service. As a side benefit, it directly relates to properties on the resulting security context (Claim.Issuer) in the WIF abstraction layer. Which once again makes me wonder, if the client calls it Claim.Issuer, why does WIF make you derive from SecurityTokenService to supply your issuance policy? It's not very symmetric, is it? And I don't think anyone would buy into renaming Claim.Issuer to Claim.STS...

Note that I'm not in any way disparaging my audience with my "less syllables" argument. I just figure why put up more mental hurdles for a topic that is already a little mind bending to many who are new to this space.</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="70376"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>71507</id><published>2009-08-07T15:01:41.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-08-07T15:01:41.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Malicious data can be found everywhere, even in certificates!</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I remember talking with &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.leastprivilege.com/"&gt;Dominick&lt;/a&gt; years ago about untrusted user input, and the surprising places it can be found, and I remember back then him throwing in the idea of malicious data coming from a certificate.

&lt;p&gt;One of the big projects on my plate right now is working with the great guys at Microsoft Patterns &amp;amp; Practices on their next book, which is going to cover federated identity, claims, etc. &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/eugeniop/default.aspx"&gt;Eugenio Pace&lt;/a&gt; is leading the charge, and he just &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/eugeniop/archive/2009/08/11/announcing-new-project-patterns-practices-claims-based-authentication-authorization-guide.aspx"&gt;blogged about the project&lt;/a&gt;, so I guess it’s safe for me to talk about it as well ;-) He’s put together quite the team, including &lt;a href="http://www.leastprivilege.com/"&gt;Dominick Baier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vbertocci/"&gt;Vittorio Bertocci&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dphill/default.aspx"&gt;David Hill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/mwoloski/"&gt;Matias Woloski&lt;/a&gt;. If you know anything about claims &amp;amp; federated identity on the Microsoft platform, you’ll recognize these guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m writing the introductory chapter (kind of the “zen of federated identity”) and helping to figure out which scenarios we should use and how they should progress. The &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/eugeniop/archive/2009/08/11/announcing-new-project-patterns-practices-claims-based-authentication-authorization-guide.aspx"&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt; among the scenarios is in flux, and I’m hoping to get it much simpler than it looks now, but expect us to cover much of the same ground regardless of how we get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all going to do our best to ensure that this becomes a great resource for both new techies trying to get their heads around federated identity, as well as experienced folks who need guidance on dealing with specific scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

The ACS team has reprioritized their effort in order to provide some well needed support for RESTful web services. They will provide REST endpoints for acquiring tokens (either SAML or a simplified token format easily parsed by any REST app without needing lots of plumbing).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From the FOO:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s become a core area of focus for the team, and also a point of discussing during the customer feedback process, is that REST web services are clearly increasing in popularity with both Web and enterprise developers. What is also apparent is a significant gap has emerged in the market place for REST-based identity and access control technologies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today, developers of REST web services lack an easy, accessible means to secure their services. At MIX09, we exposed some of our thinking about taking a first step toward radically simplifying the REST developer experience, and used this as an opportunity to gauge customer interest and feedback. Your response was overwhelming, positive and confirmed our priorities as we approach the commercial availability of .NET Services. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developers face a lack of consistency and common patterns for managing identity and access control in a way that is compatible with REST. As developers move towards REST in the enterprise, they will have an increasing need for robust security. They will be required to address the more systematic security concerns of enterprise customers as well as the more complex identity management scenarios that enterprises present. They will need a way to address these requirements in a simple way that integrates well with REST.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In speaking with the community in the past several months, it became clear that we all need a better way to control access to REST web services. We believe that the .NET Access Control Service will address this need and compliment other Microsoft technologies for security and identity management. The combination of simplicity and support for key enterprise integration scenarios will ensure that .NET Services are useful to enterprise developers as well as the broader developer audience. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In order to get this done, the ACS team will be &lt;em&gt;temporarily&lt;/em&gt; suspending WS-* support, as well as passive fed support for web apps. IOW, the plan right now is that WS-* and passive fed won’t be supported when ACS is first released, but rather will be released later. This makes sense to me as ADFS v2 already has great support for WS-*, but with REST many of us have felt a bit out in the cold. Now MS has a story for federated identity in the REST space.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More from the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/netservices/archive/2009/09/18/update-on-the-next-microsoft-net-services-ctp.aspx"&gt;.NET Services Team Blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In concrete terms, this means the WS-* integration features currently supported today will be temporarily unavailable while we focus on delivering a robust infrastructure for REST web services authorization. Once this infrastructure is in place, we will work on future version features of .NET Services, like web single sign-on and rich WS-* support. In future releases, we will reinstate full support for the WS-* protocols, web Single Sign On, and round out the .NET Access Control Service offering in a way that spans the REST/SOAP spectrum. We’ll talk more about these future features at a later date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those who were expecting to use ACS via WS-* or passive fed immediately at RTM should be rethinking their strategies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;FWIW, I’m going to be busy over the next couple of months rewriting the ACS whitepaper, as pretty much all that’s in there now won’t be supported at RTM (but instead will be delayed until sometime after RTM to make way for the new REST support).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>72791</id><published>2009-09-23T07:16:41.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-09-23T07:16:41.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: .NET Access Control Service takes a REST</title><content type="html">I don't completely agree with your statement "This makes sense to me as ADFS v2 already has great support for WS-*". Indeed, ADFS2 has great WS-* and SAMLP support. However, there isn't currently a cloud version of ADFS2.
Consider the classical scenario of a multi-tenant webapp hosted on Azure, federated with the tenant's identity providers. A typical solution to this scenario would be to use ACS in front of the webapp, doing the tenant federation and issuing normalized identity and authorization claims to the webapp. With the new ACS, how can this be done:
 a) Inserting the federation logic inside the webapp?
 b) Creating a custom Azure STS based on WIF?
 c) Using a on-premises ADFS2?
Both a) and b) imply a significant amount of code. Solution c) does not make sense to me.

Am I missing something here?

But one thing I miss is the “let” operation that allows me to compute intermediate results and store them in a new variable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This morning I came across a case where this would really simplify things, so I sat down to remember how to do it (I know I’ve done it before but I couldn’t remember the trick). So I wrote the simplest query I could think of using LET…&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;[] input = { &lt;span class="str"&gt;"asdf"&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="str"&gt;"asd"&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="str"&gt;"as"&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="str"&gt;"a"&lt;/span&gt; };

IEnumerable&amp;lt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; results =
    from s &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; input
    let x = s.Length
    select &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;.Format(&lt;span class="str"&gt;"{0} ({1})"&lt;/span&gt;, s, x);

Print(results);&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and looked at it with &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/"&gt;RedGate Reflector&lt;/a&gt;, and remembered how I’d done this before – by introducing an enveloping anonymous type. Here’s the equivalent using extension methods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;results = input
    .Select(s =&amp;gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; { s = s, x = s.Length })
    .Select(e =&amp;gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;.Format(&lt;span class="str"&gt;"{0} ({1})"&lt;/span&gt;, e.s, e.x));&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these queries produce the same results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;asdf (4)
  &lt;br /&gt;asd (3)

  &lt;br /&gt;as (2)

  &lt;br /&gt;a (1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;There’s an object being processed in the pipeline – in this case it’s a string. The trick is to envelope that object with an anonymous type so that you can add one or more sibling variables that travel with it through the pipeline. The variable “e” in this example is the envelope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not often I need LET, but when I do, I’ll be glad I jotted this down.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>73055</id><published>2009-10-07T12:48:29.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-10-07T12:48:29.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Using LET in LINQ with extension method syntax</title><content type="html">Even easier - use Linqpad:

While I’ve always thought of issuers as “caring” for their users (in the case where the issuer is acting as an identity provider) or “caring” for their apps (in the case where the issuer is designed to issue tokens with claims specific to an app), Vittorio takes it a step further and shows the boundaries at which the user’s token can be “enriched” by authorities as these boundaries are crossed. I think this is an excellent way to think about things.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now that there’s actually something to toy with, as opposed to hand-weave how beautiful a claims-flavoured world would be, I distinctly felt a change in the kind of questions I get: more pragmatic, aimed at understanding how to solve specific *practical* (as opposed to hypothetical) problems or how to integrate with existing assets. One thing that really surprised me is how difficult it could be for people to understand what to put in claims, or who is supposed to add what/where, and so on. There is surprisingly little in literature about this: or rather, this should not surprise at all since the tools that would enable the industry to even pose the question are emerging just now. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So, after so many practical/basic posts lately here there’s some scatter consideration about what should go into claims…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We’re still a ways from being able to prescribe detailed guidance for what to put into claims, where to put it, etc. but this is a step in the right direction.

System.Uri (from the .NET Framework) has had me fooled for a long time. Normally when I need to extract the string value of a Uri instance, I use the AbsoluteUri method to do that. But that doesn’t work when the Uri instance models a relative URI. Indeed support for relative URI in the Uri class is almost nonexistant (makes me wish for a derived class called HttpUri that *would* allow you to work with relative URI, but that’s a topic for another day).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So the quick and dirty fallback I took when I wasn’t sure what type of Uri I had was to call ToString() to get the value of the URI (typically to pass to Response.Redirect, which sadly doesn’t use the Uri class, but expects a string). And this works just dandy until you get a Uri that has escaped characters in it that need to stay escaped for things to work properly (the example that killed me was ReturnUrl for Forms auth in ASP.NET).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The problem with carelessly using Uri.ToString is that it unescapes the URI before returning it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That bears repeating, in bold.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uri.ToString unescapes the URI before returning it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The documentation for this method clearly states that this happens. But if you’re not thinking about escaped characters when you write your code, you’re not going to notice that anything’s wrong until it actually encounters certain escape sequences (in my case, the ReturnUrl was being truncated after an escaped ampersand got unescaped by Uri.ToString).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This can be really confusing while debugging…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;…when for example, you hover your mouse over a variable of type System.Uri in the debugger. Because the debugger calls ToString() to get a string to display (at least I assume this is what’s happening, because if you set a watch on a System.Uri object, what you see will be different than if you watched its OriginalString or AbsoluteUri property instead, if there are escaped chars in the URI). This fooled me for a long time. But no longer! Now I know to take what the debugger shows for a Uri object with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unless you *really* want to unescape the URI, when writing code that uses the System.Uri class, I’d recommend using Uri.OriginalString instead of ToString to get the value of a Uri that may be absolute or relative. That will *not* unescape the string, and it’s one of the few properties on the Uri class that don’t throw an InvalidOperationException for a relative URI.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here are my new personal rules that I’m going to use when using the System.Uri class:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Uri.AbsoluteUri to get the value of a URI when you know it’s absolute.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Uri.OriginalString to get the value of a URI when it could be either absolute or relative.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Uri.ToString to get the value of a URI only when you really want it to be unescaped (e.g. when you want to display it nicely for a human).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I hope this saves you a headache like the one I’ve had trying to track down the silly bug that this caused in our website.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>73094</id><published>2009-10-10T12:28:42.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-10-10T12:28:42.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">Did FxCop tell you to use System.Uri?</title><content type="html">It told me to do that.

And &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/keith/archive/2009/10/10/beware-uri-tostring.aspx"&gt;silly me&lt;/a&gt;, I took the advice.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Maybe it wasn’t silly advice at all. But when, like me, you’ve been used to programming ASP.NET for years (which does NOT follow this advice) and you flip over to use the Uri class to represent URI instead of raw strings (like ASP.NET still does), you will be in for a few surprises that may hurt you down the road.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong. This is a bit of a rant, and I recommend using System.Uri. But I can recommend using it only after you’re aware of the gotchas.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) System.Uri is not at all friendly to relative URI.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many of the most useful properties that help you parse a URI are simply not supported for relative URI. Get used to your code compiling fine and then at runtime seeing InvalidOperationException thrown when you try to access helpful properties such as Uri.Query, etc. Sure seems like it would be helpful to have an HttpUri derived class that *would* know how to work with relative HTTP URI. I would certainly use it!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My recommendation to avoid surprises here? Test evey line of code that uses System.Uri with relative URI. Now some code will be specifically designed to work only with absolute URI, and in that case, you should use the Uri.IsAbsoluteUri property to confirm your assumption as part of that code.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Beware converting System.Uri to its string value.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Use Uri.AbsoluteUri to pull out the string value when you know you’ve got an absolute URI.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the Uri could be relative, AbsoluteUri will throw InvalidOperationException (because, well, it’s not an absolute URI). But don’t fall back and call Uri.ToString instead &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/keith/archive/2009/10/10/beware-uri-tostring.aspx"&gt;like I did&lt;/a&gt;. Prefer Uri.OriginalString which acts more like Uri.AbsoluteUri in that it does not transform the URI before returning it like Uri.ToString does (Uri.ToString unescapes the URI which could leave you with a bug that only shows up occasionally).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Take what the debugger shows you about System.Uri with a grain of salt.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The debugger appears to call Uri.ToString to show you the value of a URI. This will confuse the heck out of you when you’re looking at a URI that you KNOW contains escaped characters, because it will appear as if the URI has been unescaped. If you think you’re a victim of this treachery, set your watch on the OriginalString property of your Uri instead and breathe a sigh of relief that you are not crazy after all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft should practice what they preach.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If ASP.NET used the URI class like FxCop tells us we should, it’d be much harder to run into problems with (2) because developers wouldn’t be worried about converting back and forth between System.Uri and strings. Indeed when you program ASP.NET it’s actually harder to write correct code using System.Uri because of these required conversions. You certainly do need to think a lot harder when using System.Uri. I think the ASP.NET team should talk with the FxCop team and get their story straight. Either use URI everywhere, or strings everywhere. Expecting imperfect developers (like me) to deal with this boundary is just asking for trouble, IMHO.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening to my little rant. I hope this spares somebody else the headaches I’ve endured trying to use System.Uri in my ASP.NET web apps.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>73104</id><published>2009-10-11T05:53:34.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-10-11T05:53:34.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Did FxCop tell you to use System.Uri?</title><content type="html">I *hate* System.Uri.

I would much prefer to isolate my application developers from the details of whatever library I happen to be using today to get details about my user.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;ASP.NET developers are used to getting an IPrincipal (and from that, an IIdentity) from HttpContext.User, WCF’s SecurityContext, etc. But modern web SSO libraries offer more than just the Name and IsInRole() query that these interfaces deliver. And as much as Microsoft may claim that IClaimsIdentity from the Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) is the LAST identity interface we’ll ever see, I’m doubtful. There’s a LOT of churn in the identity space right now. And even if there weren’t a lot of churn, I don’t think I’d want to have my developers worrying about which URI (ClaimType) they should search for to get the user’s email claim. What if there’s more than one? What would that mean?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m still of the opinion that an application would benefit from having a custom interface that encapsulated all of the identity needs for that application. It might be as simple as this:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; IUser
{
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; Name { get; }
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; Email { get; }
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; IsInRole(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; role);
}&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I threw IsInRole and Name in the mix for convenience; these are also available on the default IPrincipal/IIdentity pair that you get from ASP.NET, WCF, etc. Email is the interesting addition here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question I have for you, readers, has nothing to do with the structure of IUser itself, but rather, how would you suggest *getting* to a concrete implementation of it? Is this the sort of thing you’d want in an Inversion of Control Container, for example? Or would you prefer to hang this off of a custom principal object that you’d hang off of HttpContext.User?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems like using HttpContext.User makes it less unit-testable because then your code depends on HttpContext.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re at it, does it offend you that I didn’t derive IUser from IPrincipal? If I had done that, it would imply that you could get to an IClaimsIdentity in order to get to extra stuff without changing the IUser interface. But that wasn’t the intent.&lt;/p&gt;

You could use something like a repository class Repository&lt;IUser&gt; to do CRUD and a service class like UserAuthenticator.AuthenticateUser(IUser, IProvidedCredentials) for that problem. 

And in both cases, yes, I would use an IoC to inject those into your worker class, for instance an MVC controller.

This would allow testing of the service class, the repo, and the user implementation each in isolation.&lt;/IUser&gt;</content><author><name>david-starr</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="76009"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>76018</id><published>2010-04-09T06:04:05.0-05:00</published><updated>2010-04-09T06:04:05.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Question to Software Designers: IUser</title><content type="html">Ian and I have been using MEF to provide this sort of thing.

It's pretty clean to create a custom singleton pattern for obtaining a custom interface based user context.  Under the hood, the singleton calls into a provider pattern which returns the user context.  Different providers handle different authentication mechanisms, i.e. unit-test provider, emulation providers (for debug),  web-forms, ntlm, etc.  (and soon claims for sso in my case.)   

The only problem with this route can be third-party components that rely on standard Auth. So if the plumbing isn't coupled correctly, it's gonna spring a leak.  </content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="76009"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>76024</id><published>2010-04-09T12:45:58.0-05:00</published><updated>2010-04-09T12:45:58.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Question to Software Designers: IUser</title><content type="html">I would agree that using httpcontext.user within you code makes testing much harder.

Scott has some interesting read for ASP .Net MVC to help testing by using a Model Binder.

Also you could use WSFederationAuthenticationModule_SecurityTokenValidated event to inject you own custom principal in an ASP .Net App.

I’ve finally bitten the bullet and started integrating MVC into our website so that going forward, we’ll have a cleaner architecture that allows for better testability, separation of concerns, etc. This transition has been a fun and challenging one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this effort, I’ve done a lot of experimenting with different ways of implementing testable, maintainable views. There are a lot of good threads out there that touch on this. Here are a few that I happened to read this morning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://codeclimber.net.nz/archive/2009/10/27/12-asp.net-mvc-best-practices.aspx"&gt;http://codeclimber.net.nz/archive/2009/10/27/12-asp.net-mvc-best-practices.aspx&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/michelotti/archive/2009/10/25/asp.net-mvc-view-model-patterns.aspx"&gt;http://geekswithblogs.net/michelotti/archive/2009/10/25/asp.net-mvc-view-model-patterns.aspx&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.arrangeactassert.com/asp-net-mvc-view-best-practices-keep-logic-out-of-your-views/"&gt;http://www.arrangeactassert.com/asp-net-mvc-view-best-practices-keep-logic-out-of-your-views/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A comment in the last thread by Jaime prompted me to write this post. I’m still not completely settled on the details of the techniques I think will work best for us at Pluralsight, but some ideas are definitely crystallizing, so I figured I’d jot them down here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, I’ve come to the conclusion that using ViewModels is pretty critical for us, since I want to be able to write automated tests that assure me that the dynamic data I want rendered is likely to actually be rendered. And I want those tests to be exposed to precisely the data that’s going to be rendered in the view – no more and no less. Using domain models directly in views feels like a nice shortcut, but doesn’t lead to this outcome except in very simple cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another goal of mine is to eliminate *all* logic from the views themselves so the views become simply a way to interleave HTML tags with dynamic content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first habits I worked on breaking was including “if” statements in views to manage optional sections. I used a lot of asp:Panel controls in my WebForm days, and it felt pretty natural to replace those panels with “if” statements in the view. After writing a couple of views this way, I quickly realized I was not going to get the level of testability I wanted. So instead of an “if” in the view checking a flag to see if an optional section should be rendered, I now take that section of the view and make another view model for it. Here’s a view model for showing a pencil with an optional erasor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; SampleViewModels
{
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; ShowPencil
    {
        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; Brand { get; set; }
        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; Erasor Erasor { get; set; }
    }

    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; Erasor
    {
        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; Color { get; set; }
    }
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once ShowPencil is constructed, my automated tests can walk over the structure and assert that Erasor is null or not based on the scenario I’m testing. To render the Erasor, I use a partial view, but I don’t use an “if” statement, as you’ll see later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a lot of asp:MultiView controls in my WebForms days. Now if I have a section of the view that needs to render one thing or another depending on business logic, I use a very similar approach to the Erasor, except I more loosely type the link to the child view model, such as I do with Mechanism below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; SampleViewModels
{
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; ShowPencilSharpener
    {
        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; Brand { get; set; }
        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; Mechanism { get; set; }
    }
    
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; ElectricSharpeningMechanism
    {
        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; Voltage { get; set; }
    }

    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; MechanicalSharpeningMechanism
    {
        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; ArmLength { get; set; }
    }
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These techniques allow me to easily test right under the surface of my views. I say “easily” because it’s conceptually easy, but as business logic gets more complicated and views have more optional features, tests get more complicated as well, but that’s the price you pay for complicated business logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the only trick is to build a set of views and partial views that can render these dynamically structured view models. It turns out the templating features[1] introduced in ASP.NET MVC 2 work very nicely for this. For example, here’s a what a partial view for ShowPencilSharpener might look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&amp;lt;%@ Control Language=&lt;span class="str"&gt;"C#"&lt;/span&gt; Inherits=&lt;span class="str"&gt;"System.Web.Mvc.ViewUserControl&amp;lt;SampleViewModels.ShowPencilSharpener&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt; %&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
Brand: &amp;lt;%: Model.Brand %&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;%= Html.DisplayFor(model =&amp;gt; model.Mechanism) %&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DisplayFor won’t show anything if model.Mechanism is null. But if there’s something there, it will use a well defined template resolution strategy[2] to find an appropriate partial view to use. And the view selected depends on the type of object that my controller (or better yet, my view model builder) put into the Mechanism property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say my view model used a MechanicalSharpeningMechanism. I write a custom display template (which is really just a partial view) so I can control how that section of the view should look. Another nice feature of breaking things up like this is that if any other view model uses MechanicalSharpeningMechanism, I can easily reuse that partial view for rendering that part of the view model, if it makes sense to do so. Here’s what that partial view might look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&amp;lt;%@ Control Language=&lt;span class="str"&gt;"C#"&lt;/span&gt; Inherits=&lt;span class="str"&gt;"System.Web.Mvc.ViewUserControl&amp;lt;SampleViewModels.MechanicalSharpeningMechanism&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt; %&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
Arm length: &amp;lt;%: Model.ArmLength %&amp;gt; inches
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of view model composition seems really powerful to me. This morning I’m experimenting with new ways of generating forms based on this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge kudos to Brad Wilson for taking the time to walk us all through MVC 2 templates. His lucid explanation made my life much easier when I went searching for a way to render these dynamically structured view models.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been trying to use similar ideas to construct generic forms, but I’m running into a problem that I’m hoping there’s an easy way to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve built a very simple example to demonstrate what I’m seeing: a Widget controller that allows you to Create new Widgets. I’m using the default route, nothing special. But I’m using view models, not domain models. Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; CreateWidgetPage
{
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; SummaryOfExistingWidgets;
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; CreateWidgetForm TheForm;
}

&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; CreateWidgetForm
{
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; Name { get; set; }
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; Color { get; set; }
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page I display when you GET /Widget/Create includes more than just a form. I’ve got some display-only details that I want to show the user when she’s about to create a widget. It doesn’t matter what it is, the point is that it’s not something that’s logically part of the form that I want posted back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the interesting part of the Create view, which relies on &lt;a href="http://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/aspnet-mvc-2-templates-part-4-custom-object-templates.html"&gt;Brad’s tabular Object.ascx editor template&lt;/a&gt; to display a simple editable table for Name and Color:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="asp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt;: Model.SummaryOfExistingWidgets &lt;span class="asp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Create&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; ...&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="asp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt;= Html.EditorFor(m =&amp;gt; m.TheForm) &lt;span class="asp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;='submit'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;='Create'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the controller’s Create method that processes the form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; ActionResult Create(CreateWidgetForm formModel) 
{
   &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ViewModel that is posted to Create has null values for both Name and Color. Why? Because the EditorFor helper is encoding the scoping element, “TheForm”, as a prefix on the names of the properties on the view model. If I inspect the HTML that is rendered with a GET to /Widget/Create, the Name property is represented like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;="TheForm.Name"&lt;/span&gt; ... &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly this isn’t going to bind well to CreateWidgetForm, which knows about a “Name”, not “TheForm.Name”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to divorce CreateWidgetForm from its scope, I tried this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="asp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; var theForm = Model.TheForm; &lt;span class="asp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="asp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt;= Html.EditorFor(m =&amp;gt; theForm) &lt;span class="asp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This didn’t help. The variable, “theForm”, ended up being used as the scope:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="html"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="attr"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;="theForm.Name"&lt;/span&gt; ... &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see how someone using domain models directly in their views wouldn’t run into this problem. GET on the controller’s Create would return a Widget, say, and POST to the controller’s Create would send that exact same thing back. There’s no need for nesting the way I’ve done it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like what I need is a way to tell EditorFor that I want a new root. Don’t pay attention to the fact that TheForm is a property on some bigger object. I want TemplateDepth = 1 when we drill into EditorFor in the above examples. There’s probably some super easy way to do this that I’m just not finding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed what I’m trying to achieve with ViewModels goes beyond the simplified example I’ve used above. I’m thinking it would be quite nice to have a very generic template for a create form. Something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; CreateForm
{
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; PrettyNameForTheThingWeAreAboutToCreate;
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; FormModel;
}&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I searched quite a bit to see if anyone else had posted about this issue and didn’t find anything, but I can’t be the first to run into this. What am I missing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SOLVED (Thanks Brad :-)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution in my case is to use the overloaded version of EditorFor which allows you to control the prefix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="asp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt;= Html.EditorFor(m =&amp;gt; m.FormModel, null, "") &lt;span class="asp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

You have a few ways you can fix this:

1. Name the action parameter "theForm". The names line up then.

2. Decorate the action parameter with [Bind(Prefix="TheForm")].

3. Use the overload of EditorFor which allows you to specify the HTML field name to be used:

&lt;_ html.editorform=""&gt; m.TheForm, null, String.Empty) %&amp;gt;

It occurred to me early on that I’d much rather use type names to identify resources and controllers rather than string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a WidgetController, why pass controller=“Widget” when you could specify the type of the controller instead? Then you’d see compile errors early, as opposed to having links with empty href elements because the HtmlHelper couldn’t find a matching route because you misspelled a controller name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could solve this particular problem by using constants (controller = Controllers.Widget), I suppose. But then when you look at how Areas work, it sure would be nice having the type as part of the route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose the reason controller names are passed around as strings so much is because of the default routes that ASP.NET MVC gives you when you run the wizard: {controller}/{id}/{action}. But for someone who wants to take a more RESTful approach, you don’t want this style of routing anyway, and you’ll be adding a bunch of custom routes instead of trying to use one generic URL pattern for routing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In large systems, {controller} isn’t enough to identify a controller anyway. You need to add areas to ensure uniqueness of controller names. Which leads me to the subject of this post (finally!) I’m wondering if anyone can think of any major drawback to simply removing {controller} from the values used in RouteData.Values and replace it with {controllerType} in RouteData.DataTokens. In one fell swoop you eliminate both controller names and area names from the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In large systems where you care about testing, you’re likely to be using ViewModels and modeling links to make them testable. So you won’t be using Html.ActionLink anyway, and it’s very natural to use controller types to build the models for links to controllers that you depend on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve got a prototype of this working now, and it allows me to put my controllers wherever I like (they don’t have to be in the Controllers folder). My unit tests for resolving incoming requests and outgoing URL generation are all green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next step is to build a custom view engine that looks for views based on the controller type. Once that’s wrapped up, I should have very natural support for “areas” that’s based on the types of the controllers, with a hierarchy that follows the namespace structure of the controllers, which should naturally resolve any naming conflicts that could arise. My initial thought about view resolution is that it’d be nice to be able to map an arbitrary prefix of the controller type (e.g. the first bit of the namespace) onto a root folder for the “area” then have the namespace-driven search algorithm take over from there, following the rest of the namespace down the folder tree from the “area” root. Might also be nice to have the view engine be able to pick up shared views from anywhere up the hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request to the MVC team:&lt;/strong&gt; I had to make one minor change to MvcHandler to be able to get ASP.NET MVC 2 to work this way. I changed MvcHandler.ProcessRequestInit from [private] to [protected virtual]. This allowed me to reuse the vast majority of MvcHandler (the async stuff would be a bitch to reimplement). This seems like a really useful extensibility point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update (3 Jun 2010)&lt;/b&gt;: My view engine is complete, and it's working like a charm. No more worrying about "areas" - I get a nice hierarchical site based on the structure of the namespaces of the types that I use in my application. If I run into any problems I'll post them here, but it looks like this is a feasible way to implement a RESTful routing scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

To unit test the bits that construct a path from a namespace, I needed to have a bunch of different types of controllers, and using actual types was clearly going to get messy, so I synthesized my own dynamic types using Reflection.Emit. This particular example is hardcoded to produce classes that derive from System.Web.Mvc.Controller, but it’s a great start for anyone who wants to synthesize types for whatever reason. It was well worth 15 minutes of research and coding. Kudos to the .NET team for making it so easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of usage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;var factory = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; ControllerTypeFactory();
var type = factory.MakeControllerType(&lt;span class="str"&gt;"Foo.Bar.MyController"&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output from this call allows you to avoid having to write this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; Foo.Bar
{
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; MyController : Controller { }
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want an instance instead of just the type, call MakeController instead, which simply adds a call to Activator.CreateInstance() on the dynamically created type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the code. Note that it creates a “RunAndCollect” assembly, which is great for simple cases like this because the assembly will be unloaded from the domain automatically once everything in it is collected. It’s making my unit tests green, which is making me smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="csharpcode"&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; ControllerTypeFactory
{
    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; AssemblyBuilder assemblyBuilder;

    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; ControllerTypeFactory()
    {
        var assemblyName = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; AssemblyName(Guid.NewGuid().ToString());
        assemblyBuilder = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.DefineDynamicAssembly(assemblyName,AssemblyBuilderAccess.RunAndCollect);
    }

    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; Type MakeControllerType(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; controllerTypeName)
    {
        var moduleBuilder = assemblyBuilder.DefineDynamicModule(&lt;span class="str"&gt;"module"&lt;/span&gt;);
        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; TypeAttributes typeAttributes = TypeAttributes.Public | TypeAttributes.Class;
        var parentType = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;(Controller);
        var typeBuilder = moduleBuilder.DefineType(controllerTypeName, typeAttributes, parentType);
        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; typeBuilder.CreateType();
    }

    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;internal&lt;/span&gt; ControllerBase MakeController(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; controllerTypeName)
    {
        var controllerType = MakeControllerType(controllerTypeName);
        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; (ControllerBase)Activator.CreateInstance(controllerType);
    }

The first part was where Aaron added in an attribute on his Presentation Feed service to require a claim before granting access to the feed. You can get the code for his service and my WCF behavior attribute from his demos &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net/community/blogs/aaron/archive/2010/06/12/aaron-skonnard-s-teched-na-2010-session-demos.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The code for the client that authenticates with ACS to get a token to send in the Authorization header to Aaron’s service can be found in my demos (below). It’s in the PresentationFeedClient folder.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The second part of my demo used a simple string reverser service that I built in ASP.NET MVC. Once again, I simply authenticated directly with ACS, got a token, and sent it to the service as part of the Authorization header.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The third part of my demo simulated an enterprise single sign on. I used &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/justinjsmith/archive/2009/11/14/acs-saml-adfs-v2-sample.aspx"&gt;Justin Smith’s “mini ADFS” simulator&lt;/a&gt; to issue a SAML token to my client, simulating a logon request to a real ADFS federation server in a domain. I then sent this SAML token up to ACS and got back a SWT (Simple Web Token) which I sent to my string reverser service, which allowed me in.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The service and client for these last two parts can also be found in the StringReverser folder of my demos (below). I also included a copy of Justin’s MiniADFS server as part of the solution. I hope he doesn’t mind! You’ll need to install the &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/details.aspx?familyid=C148B2DF-C7AF-46BB-9162-2C9422208504&amp;amp;displaylang=en"&gt;Windows Identity Foundation SDK&lt;/a&gt; to run this third demo, as that’s where the SAML and WS-Trust support comes from.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I used the sample ACS Management Browser from the &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=39856a03-1490-4283-908f-c8bf0bfad8a5"&gt;Azure AppFabric SDK&lt;/a&gt; to set up a very simple policy in ACS to issue the tokens needed by the services. I included a copy of the policy in the policy.xml file. Nothing fancy here – just simple rules based on issuer claims.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Download my demos &lt;a href="http://pluralsight-free.s3.amazonaws.com/keith-brown/shows/2010-06-TechEd-ACS-demos.zip"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thanks to those who turned in evaluations.

We made a number of updates last Friday, which I’ll summarize in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been advertising the new &lt;a href="/microsoft/olt/subscriptions.aspx"&gt;Ultimate subscription&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you three vouchers for &lt;a href="/microsoft/vil/default.aspx"&gt;virtual classroom training&lt;/a&gt;. It’s now live, and you can purchase it on our website, or upgrade to it if you already have a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve received a lot of feedback from our customers, which we take to heart. As a result, we’ve simplified the structure of our &lt;em&gt;On-Demand!&lt;/em&gt; content so it’s easier to navigate and find what you are looking for. We’ve broken up several of our larger courses into smaller, more focused courses. This makes the content in those courses more discoverable (before this was done, for example, I didn’t realize we had a module on &lt;a href="/microsoft/olt/Course/Toc.aspx?n=aspdotnet-ajax-jscript#scott-allen/ajax-jquery"&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt;, but now it’s much easier to find). We’ve also restructured some of our HOWTO series of videos into courses, which should make them easier to navigate using our course viewers. Please note that we’ve not taken any content away. We’ve simply reorganized it for consistency and ease of navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re wondering where “Tutorials” went, they are still around, they’ve just been incorporated as “Beginner” content in our main course library. Now there’s just &lt;a href="/microsoft/olt/courses.aspx"&gt;one page&lt;/a&gt; to visit to list all of our courses and tutorials. Oh, and “Beginner” is one of three levels we’ve added on each of our courses to help you more easily find content appropriate to your level of experience with any given subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve recategorized the content a bit so that you’ll get better results when you use the “Browse the library” control and search for technologies (we still need to prune that list down a bit, so bear with us). We’ve also restructured our &lt;a href="/microsoft/olt/courses.aspx"&gt;course listing page&lt;/a&gt;, categorizing courses so that they are easier to find. We’ve got a brand new search engine in the works that will only search content in the &lt;em&gt;On-Demand!&lt;/em&gt; library, and I expect to see that going live either this week or next, so watch for the “search” box to reappear soon and be a *lot* more useful to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another cool feature we’ve added is progress checkmarks. From now on, a checkmark will show up in the course table of contents once you watch a clip. And when you’ve watched all of the clips in a module, a checkmark will show up next to that module so that you can track your overall progress. Our Silverlight player shows these checkmarks next to clip titles as well. Keep in mind that these won’t show up immediately when you click on a clip to start watching it, but the next time you refresh the table of contents page or launch the player, you’ll see that they are updated. We plan on adding some script to hasten their appearance in the future. [EDIT: 8/16/2010 - I've run a script to scrape though our logs and add checkmarks to all user accounts for all content you've watched in the past. Hope this helps!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you like the new structure and look of the library. Our goal with all of this work is to make it easier for you to navigate and digest our growing library of content. Thanks go out to those of you who took the time to share feedback with us. Keep it coming!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>keith-brown</name></author></entry><entry><id>96524</id><published>2010-11-12T11:17:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2010-11-12T11:17:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Min, Max, Between, Limit</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Call it what you will, often times you just want to limit the value of something.

var limitedValue = Math.Max(1, Math.Min(12, submittedValue));&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally don’t like this approach, because I have a hell of a time remembering the order of the minimum and maximum value. Makes me think too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’d really rather have is a “Between” method that lets me pass the min and max as an argument.

        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;;

it would probably be safer to test for &amp;lt; 0 (first if) and &amp;gt; 0 (second if).  I know I've certainly implemented IComparable such that my CompareTo method returns negative and positive numbers other than exactly -1 and 1.</content><author><name>mike-woodring</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="96524"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>96846</id><published>2010-11-15T10:34:56.0-05:00</published><updated>2010-11-15T10:34:56.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Min, Max, Between, Limit</title><content type="html">Good catch, Mike.

&lt;p&gt;I'm helping get this off the ground - please help me spread the word!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We meet the second Tuesday of each month at 6:00pm in South Jordan at AdvanceMD:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10876 S Riverfront Pkwy Ste 400&lt;br /&gt;South Jordan, UT 84095
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We have a &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/salt-lake-software-craftsmanship"&gt;google group&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The plan is to have a few 15 minute &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Talk"&gt;lightning talks&lt;/a&gt; by various presenters with a 45-minute &lt;a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/code_kata_backg.html"&gt;kata&lt;/a&gt; at the end.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;I'll be there (I'm going to give one of the lightning talks) and if you're in the area, we'd love to see you attend!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

There were some major pain points, such as when I'd move folders around in VS, I'd end up with a really hosed working copy that would take some time to clean up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently started using VisualSVN and it's worth its weight in gold. It has very clean integration with TortoiseSVN, so virtually all of the dialogs you see are actually Tortoise dialogs, and since I've already been using TortoiseSVN for so long, I'm finding this much more natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to give it a try if you're using Visual Studio and SVN, especially if you use TortoiseSVN already. Excellent product!&lt;/p&gt;

VisualSVN might not be as sexy as some other source control apps, but its seamless integration with Visual Studio and Tortoise makes for a powerful solution.  

I've installed the VisualSVN server on two VPS's in both Windows 2003 Server and Windows 2008, and for both it works flawlessly.

Have a good one,
Dave
