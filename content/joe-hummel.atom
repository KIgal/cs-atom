&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;walk the stack looking to see which catch block will be executed, then&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go back and walk the stack again, executing finally blocks and popping stack frames until we reach the appropriate catch block.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that (1) will end up walking into UC if necessary...  Now, VB has the following feature (also available in IL if you prefer to write your code that way), which allows you to filter your exception handling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try&lt;br /&gt;       &amp;lt;&amp;lt; ask TedP to insert something funny here &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catch ex As Exception &lt;strong&gt;When HandleIfThisMethodCallReturnsTrue(ex)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;       . . .&lt;br /&gt;End Catch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The problem?  The filter methods are called by the CLR during &lt;strong&gt;step (1)&lt;/strong&gt; of exception processing, which means that it's possible for untrusted code in UC to execute.  Since the stack has not yet been cleaned up (the CLR is still trying to figure out what catch block to execute), a UC filter method can walk the stack, look at trusted state, etc.  I'm not sure (hey Keith?), but it may also be that UC will execute with the permission set of our trusted code, which could be very bad.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So what's the solution?  While .NET 2.0 will contain a “clean up the stack please” method (sorry, didn't take notes on the exact details), the solution that works in all versions of .NET is to make sure we catch all exception types in our trusted code, and then (if appropriate) re-throw the exception with “Throw Ex”.  This will prevent UC filters from executing before the stack is cleaned up, while retaining the semantics of what we're after --- telling the client about the exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the bigger scheme of things, I wonder how the heck we're supposed to learn / teach writing secure code.  This exploit is subtle, and depends on implementation details of the CLR which very few know.  Right now the approach is all very reactive, dealing with exploit X and exploit Y.  We're still in the very early stages of figuring this out, but eventually we're going to need some better theory.  Academics, start your grant writing engines :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Before I sign off, I'd like to thank my friends at pluralsight for letting me hang out here.  Thanks guys, it feels good to be back.  Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>joe-hummel</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>10770</id><published>2005-06-09T15:00:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-06-09T15:00:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Wow, Writing Secure Code is Subtle</title><content type="html">Glad to see you blogging here.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The biggest issues I know of are a) unexpected reentrancy into the class if the class designer expected his finally block to restore a class invariant, and b) contextual side-effects like impersonation.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I talked about (a) here: http://pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/archive/2005/04/27/7803.aspx

&lt;br /&gt;Most application devs won't need to worry about this - they probably aren't writing plumbing that will be used by untrusted code.

&lt;br /&gt;I'm glad to see you've finally started a blog. I'm sure readers will love to hear more about you and your work, especially after hosting these two MSDN Webcast series for us here at Microsoft.

(and if so, thanks!)  Anyway, as some of you may know, I host a webcast series for MSDN on what I call "Modern Software Development in .NET", where I try to help bring people up to speed on how things have evolved over the last 5-10 years:  OOP, OOD with interfaces &amp;amp; inheritance, exceptions, VM-based execution, multi-tier design, distributed programming, web services, etc.  Let's face it, some folks have been programming in a procedural way all their life (and with great success), and have never had a chance (or the need) to jump on the OOP bandwagon.  But the train is leaving the station, and with Java and .NET here to stay, you can't use these environment effectively unless you work your way to the front of the train.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm excited that Microsoft is giving me a chance to run another webcast series this coming Fall, probably to start in late August and run through December.  What I plan to do is a follow-on series to what we've been doing, integrating architecture-level topics with deeper explanations of what's coming in .NET 2.0 and VS 2005.  As much as possible I want to be language-neutral, though a few webcasts will no doubt end up being devoted to language-specific issues.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here's where you come in --- if you could learn more about 3 topics, what would those topics be?  Here's another way to think about it:  if you are working in a team, what topics do you feel your team members need to know more about?  Or in general, what topics do we as trainers need to do a better job of discussing?

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FYI, look for other webcast series to start this Fall, e.g. on ASP.NET 2.0 and SQL Server 2005, with exceptional instructors driving them...

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;// C#&lt;br /&gt;List&lt;INT&gt; numbers;&lt;br /&gt;numbers = new List&lt;INT&gt;();&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;numbers.Add(123);&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;/INT&gt;&lt;/INT&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;Not only is this more efficient (no boxing), but type-safe as well. But as I discussed in my 6/21 webcast ("What's New in .NET 2.0?", &lt;a href="http://www.lakeforest.edu/~hummel/webcasts.htm"&gt;http://www.lakeforest.edu/~hummel/webcasts.htm&lt;/a&gt;), generics can be used in much more subtle --- and confusing --- ways. Whether this is good or not remains to be seen, but for now I'm just playing around with what else you can do with generics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;For example, I'm a big fan of generic data access code, i.e. ADO.NET code that can easily work against different databases. Even if you never use this code in production, it's a good example of how inheritance and interfaces can be used in real code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;Generics give us yet another option for writing generic data access code. For example, we define a GenericDataAccess class parameterized based on the type of Connection, Command, and DataAdapter objects to use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;public class GenericDataAccess&amp;lt;T1, T2, T3&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;{&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;private string m_ConnectionString;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;public GenericDataAccess(string connectionString)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;{ this.m_ConnectionString = connectionString; }&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;public DataSet Retrieve(string sql)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;{&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;T1 dbConnObject;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;dbConnObject = new T1(this.m_ConnectionString);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;// and so on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;The better way to write this --- to make sure it is used correctly --- is to add constraints to the class decl, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;public class GenericDataAccess&amp;lt;T1, T2, T3&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;where T1 : System.Data.IDbConnection, new()&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;where T2 : System.Data.IDbCommand, new()&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;where T3 : System.Data.IDbAdapter, new()&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;{ ... }&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;This ensures that the developer trying to use this GenericDataAccess class passes types that implement the appropriate interfaces for DB access, and support default constructors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;Just for fun, let's look at yet another way to write this --- using generic methods. One advantage is that we'll end up with a single data access object that can simultateously talk to different databases. So the class decl reverts back to an ordinary looking one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;public class GenericDataAccess&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;{&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;But then we define the Retrieve method like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;public DataSet Retrieve&amp;lt;T1, T2, T3&amp;gt;(string connection, string sql) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;where T1 : System.Data.IDbConnection, new()&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;where T2 : System.Data.IDbCommand, new()&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;where T3 : System.Data.IDbAdapter, new()&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;{&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;T1 dbConnObject;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;dbConnObject = new T1();&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;dbConnObject.ConnectionString = connection;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;In other words, the method is generic --- the caller must supply 3 types that control the type of database to execute the SQL against. So how do you call this thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;using MSA = System.Data.OleDb;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;using SQL = System.Data.SqlClient;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;DataAccess data = new DataAccess();&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;DataSet ds1, ds2;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;// access a MS Access database...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;ds1 = data.Retrieve&amp;lt;MSA.OLEDBCONNECTION, MSA.OleDbCommand, MSA.OleDbDataAdapter&amp;gt;(“connection string”, “Select * ...”);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;// now access a SQL Server database...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;ds2 = data.Retrieve&amp;lt;SQL.SQLCONNECTION, SQL.SqlCommand, SQL.SqlDataAdapter&amp;gt;(“connection string”, “Select * ...”);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;Crazy? Yes. Practical? I don't know, but I have that luxury as an academic :-) I can tell you that the code above runs about as eficiently as generic data access code based on an abstract base class, inheritance, interfaces, and the factory method design pattern. The latter is very elegant, OO, but takes more effort to develop. The generics-style approach is easier to throw together, runs about as fast, and seems to fall more in line with the growing practice of XP and Agile Programming, where you "don't over-design, but design and refactor as you go".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"&gt;Either way, generics are going to yield some interesting code. And more rope for some of us to hang ourselves with :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm happy to be delivering another series this fall, “Architecting Modern Desktop Apps”, most Tuesdays starting august 23rd.  Smart client, n-tier, distributed, multi-threaded, remoting, web services, etc.  I even have a new plan to make sure my homework exercises appear in a timely manner (if you followed my previous series of 15 webcasts, you probably noticed that I never released anything past the 5th homework exercise :-(  I spend a fair amount of time preparing my demos for each webcast, so my new approach for homeworks is to base them off the demos we do each week.  This way the homeworks are easier to create, and the webcast material applies directly to the homework exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, what we're going to do is develop a complete smart-client app for my wife, who's a physician at a Chicago hospital.  One of her duties is creating the call schedule for the doctors in her group, and I've written various apps for her over the years to help (as have my students at the college).  So the plan is to develop a scheduling app, which is harder than it may sound (isn't that always the truth!).  The risk of using a common app throughout the series is that attendees may tune out if the app is boring; my plan is to use it sparingly as a case study, the app will not be the focus of the series.  I also plan to make the series as language-neutral as possible, since architecture is more about the concepts than code, so the language is mostly irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landing and registration page for the new series is &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/series/modernsoftdev.mspx"&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/events/series/modernsoftdev.mspx&lt;/a&gt;, although only the first 2 webcasts (aug 23rd and aug 30th) are open for registration.  The rest should be open very shortly.  Hope you can tune in!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>joe-hummel</name></author><thr:total>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>13928</id><published>2005-08-09T05:46:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-08-09T05:46:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Next webast series --- &amp;amp;quot;Architecting Modern Desktop Apps&amp;amp;quot;</title><content type="html">Is "architecting" really a word?

I am getting a lot out of your webcasts thanks so much. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I tried to fix the issue with your MVC app concerning the text box validation firing when exiting the app. I'm stuck! Here is what I thought would work:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This method added to the adapter:
&lt;br /&gt;Public Sub HandlerRemove(ByVal subject As TextBox)
&lt;br /&gt;  RemoveHandler subject.Validating, AddressOf Me.Handler_Validating
&lt;br /&gt;End Sub
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;and this added to the form:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Private Sub FormMain_Exit()
&lt;br /&gt;textboxValidatingAdapter.HandlerRemove(Me.txtLastName)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; textboxValidatingAdapter.HandlerRemove(Me.txtFirstName)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; Me.Close()
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;End Sub
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The validation fired anyway. What would be your fix? 
&lt;br /&gt;

To me it seems like these adapters need to be somewhat tightly coupled with the view because in order to pass information into the commands they need to go acess buttons and text boxes and things like that.  So it seems like you're going to build adapters for every situation and not gain a lot of reuse or flexibility.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Am I missing something?  Or do I just need to work with it for a while before it becomes clear?</content><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><thr:in-reply-to ref="13942"></thr:in-reply-to></entry><entry><id>14926</id><published>2005-09-20T18:50:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2005-09-20T18:50:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">RE: Adapter pattern</title><content type="html">Glen, you have it right, use of the Adapter pattern ends up tightly coupling the client to the adapter.  But the theory is that this is better than tightly coupling the client to the server.  Examples of when the Adapter pattern makes sense are:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;  1. The server is servicing existing clients and so you can't change the server to handle the new clients.  So you have to adapt the existing interface for the new clients.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;  2. You have multiple clients at the start and the clients don't easily lend themselves to a common server interface.  So you create the best server interface you can, and adapt it as necessary to the clients.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;We're falling into case #2, trying to adapt the event handling (which is different for WinForms vs. WebForms) to a common controller.  Another approach would be to create multiple controllers, one for each presentation tier, with a Controller base class to hold common functionality.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If your goal is just a Winforms / SmartClient app, and you don't foresee multiple presentation tiers hooked to a common controller/backend, then the Adapter pattern would be overkill ("over-design").  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!

&lt;p&gt;Duh, it's the .Url property!  Let me finish this story, and then tell you an even better one :-)  But first, the .Url property.  The client starts by createing the web service object (which is really the proxy), and then sets the URL like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;this.server = new EmployeeWebService.Employees();&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Courier New"&gt;this.server.Url = Properties.Settings.EmployeeWebServiceURL;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This assumes you have defined a .config setting named &lt;em&gt;EmployeeWebServiceURL&lt;/em&gt;.  It may seem backwards to create the web service object first  and set the URL second, since don't you need the URL to create the web service object?  Nope, because you're really just creating the proxy --- the web service isn't contacted until you make a method call, and that's when you need the URL.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So that's the first part of the story:  create .config setting, and set the proxy's Url property before you call it.  So off I got to update my demo code in VS 2005, I bring up the Properties page, click the Settings tab, and behold, the .config setting is already there!  Turns out Visual Studio 2005 automatically defines an application-level setting for the project whenever you add a web reference.  So in my demo code, in the BusinessTierClient project, there's a setting called “BusinessTierClient_EmployeeWebService_Employees“ that contains the URL for the web service.  And the proxy is already coded to read this setting, so if you chance it, the proxy does the right thing.  Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The only problem is that this .config setting is stored in the component's app.config file, which for a DLL, isn't around at run-time.  So to make this work the way you want it to --- i.e. to expose the .config setting in the client-side .exe's config file --- you have to merge the DLL's app.config file with the client-side .exe's config file.  We've done this already with other settings, e.g. the connection string needed by Data Access Tier has to be merged into web.config (for a web service) or remotingserver.exe.config (for a remoting server host).  I'll update my demo and repost the demo + slides to the webcasts page, in this case app.config file associated with the EmployeeClientGUI has been updated, that's it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/language1/?CMP=ILC-2RQ886833906&amp;amp;ATT=language1"&gt;http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/language1/?CMP=ILC-2RQ886833906&amp;amp;ATT=language1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PDF represents the first in a 3-part series on LINQ; part 2 will focus specifically on LINQ for SQL, and part 3 will focus on LINQ for XML. Along with the PDFs I'll be presenting a series of MSDN webcasts on LINQ; I'll let you know when the live presentation dates become official.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LINQ offers SQL-like query support in C# and VB, allowing you to write queries --- against objects, XML documents, relational databases, and more --- with IntelliSense and strict type-checking.  For example, given a set of Doctor objects, here's a query to select all the doctors living in Chicago:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;var &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"&gt;chicago &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;= from d in doctors where d.City == “Chicago“ select d;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a CTP (May 2006) you can download in order to play with LINQ [1]. The technology is slated to appear sometime in 2007 with the &lt;em&gt;3.next&lt;/em&gt; release of .NET (i.e. the release to *follow* the upcoming 3.0 release). It's very interesting technology, I encourge you to learn about LINQ if you haven't already. Cheers!

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Compute Cluster Server, or CCS, is Microsoft's foray into the HPC cluster arena --- imagine a rack of blades with quad-core CPUs and a high-speed interconnect.  CCS was released in 2006, runs on Windows Server 2003 64-bit, and is currently at v1.0 with SP1; v2 was just announced at Supercomputing this week in Reno, and will run on Windows Server 2008 64-bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really excited to be working in the field again, finally putting all that PhD work to use :-)  Right now I'm part of a team here at Pluralsight developing a 5-day course on CCS:  what it offers, how it works, and its supported programming models (basically OpenMP and MPI).  Our first course offering is slated for the last week of November, 26-30.  For more info on the course, click &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/AppliedComputeClusterServer.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, it doesn't take that much hardware to get into CCS and experiment.  A CCS cluster consists of a head node (that manages the cluster and schedules jobs) and compute nodes (which do the actual work).  Since a head node can also server as a compute node, you can build a cluster with one computer --- any computer capable of running Windows Server 2003 64-bit.  Of course, life is more interesting if you have 2 or more compute nodes, which forces you into the world of distributed programming and MPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, take a peek at my portable cluster --- I'm using 2 Mac Minis as compute nodes and a Thinkpad as the head node (the other thinkpad is my normal working machine, and acts as a client to the cluster):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="/drjoe/images/MacMiniCluster.jpg" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mac minis make excellent portable Windows servers. I booted to the mac os, ran bootcamp, inserted the Windows 20003 CD, wiped the disk clean when it rebooted, and installed. Some of the drivers are missing (e.g. bluetooth and wireless), but the server hardware I needed --- monitor, hard disk and ethernet --- were found and installed fine. Once installed, I run them headless (you have to boot with a dvi to s-video adapter attached because the mini is looking for a monitor, but once booted you can remove the adapter and remote into the machine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I'm attending the annual Supercomputing conference, which is a great conference and getting better every year.  9,000 attendees, 87 miles of fiber optic cable, and more computing power than most countries.  Tomorrow I'll blog about one of the things I learned that blew me away:  the cost of executing an instruction is essentially 0, so optimization now is all about data locality and caching.  The optimizing compiler world has been turned on its head.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>joe-hummel</name></author></entry><entry><id>49181</id><published>2007-11-16T01:24:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-11-16T01:24:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Supercomputing 2007: &amp;amp;quot;Data Streaming&amp;amp;quot;</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Michael Wolfe, PhD, is a well-known compiler writer and parallelization guru, and currently works for &lt;a href="http://www.pgroup.com/"&gt;The Portland Group&lt;/a&gt;. He gave a vendor talk at Supercomputing this week (Reno, NV) on what he calls “Data Streaming”. He started by showing a timeline of CPU clock rates from 1997 ... 2007.  There was a clear trend:  from 1997 .. 2002, the clock rates followed Moore's law and grew by a factor of 10 --- from 300MHz to 3GHz.  But from 2002 to 2006, the rates barely grew at all (3.8GHz), and in 2007 the clock rates actually dropped back to 3GHz.  So we appear to have hit the wall in terms of CPU clock rates.  As you all know, what chip manufacturers are doing now is going multi-core to offer increased performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But forget about multi-core for a moment.  Let's look at just one core running at 3GHz.  In the good 'ole days of compiler optimization, we optimized by reducing instruction count / instruction cycles.  We have become pretty good at that, to the point that we can't feed the CPU with data fast enough --- Mike did some back-of-the-envelope calculations that I won't repeat here, but basically showed that optimized, compute-intensive code needs 16-24GB/Sec bandwidth to memory.  CPUs today don't have anywhere near that bandwidth to RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so add another core.  Michael showed this very simple picture of a two-headed straw: “Imagine you're at your favorite dinner sharing a milkshake with your significant other” (my words).  Both of you are pulling through the same base --- i.e. with two cores you still have only 1 pipe to memory.  This problem is going to get bad very quickly, since the # of cores will grow exponentially (quad-cores are getting common, 8-cores by next year, etc.).  But the # of pins to memory will not grow exponentially, though it will grow (AMD's new Barcelona quad-core chip has 2 pipes to memory).  Think of the multi-headed straw as you ponder the purchase of your next quad-core box...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is to (a) throw more and more cache at the CPU (L1, L2, L3), and (b) start programming &amp;amp; optimizing for the cache --- “to the point that you consider the cost of executing an instruction to be $0.00” (Michael's words).  So “Data Streaming” is the idea that instead of always agressively doing computation, you instead aggressively fill the cache with data you will need, and then do computation once the data arrives.  If you have 2 cores, then core #1 can be reading data while core #2 is computing; when core #2 runs out of data, it starts reading data while core #1 executes. This sounds crazy --- to have an execution core basically spend its time waiting for data --- but it turns out that you get much better performance (in compute-intensive programs) than having both cores go full-speed ahead executing instructions, and essentially both waiting for data.  Michael and a colleague did this for a spec benchmark, and got around 1.5-1.7 speedup on a 2-core CPU (vs. essentially no speedup when the code was optimized for instruction counts).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a simple example of what you can do today to optimize for better cache performance.  First, imagine a collection of objects or structs.  Second, suppose you have to run through the collection, touching a field of each object / struct:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; N; i++)&lt;br /&gt;  a[i].field++;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Every time you read from memory, the hardware reads a cache line --- 8 or 16 bytes (at least).  By using an array of objects / structs, what you just did was pollute the cache with things you are never going to use (the other fields of the struct), to get at the one field you will use.  The solution is to move back to the old days of parallel arrays, i.e. using separate arrays to hold the various fields.  The loop then becomes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; N; i++)&lt;br /&gt;   afield[i]++;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Now when you read a cache line, you'll use those other values in the cache line in future iterations.  The next step is to add prefetch instructions (which VS supports) to get ahead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; N; i++) {&lt;br /&gt;   prefetch( afield[i+8] );  // or something, this is very HW dependent&lt;br /&gt;   afield[i]++;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This is starting to approximate the “Data Streaming” idea, in that instead of doing computation, we think first about streaming in the data we're going to need.  The point of Michael's talk is that we need to start thinking about this more deeply.  I suspect Michael has some good ideas about how the compiler can help us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And here's a related item:  the TLB (translation lookaside buffer), which is responsible for translating addresses from virtual memory to physical memory, is another potential area of concern.  The TLB is in essence another cache, and is getting killed as we go multi-core --- if the cores are running different instruction streams, the TLB miss rate is growing and this means more trips to RAM, and this means more waiting.  Rough rule of thumb: the cost of each memory level is a factor of 10, so CPU to L1 is 10 cycles, CPU to L2 is 100, CPU to L3 is 1,000, and CPU to RAM is 10,000 cycles.  So you can see that waiting 10,000 cycles to read something from RAM is a BAD thing for performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The bottom line:  getting good performance from today's multi-core chips is not as easy as just creating multiple threads and handing them off to the operating system.  Fun times!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>joe-hummel</name></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>49231</id><published>2007-11-19T15:36:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2007-11-19T15:36:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: Supercomputing 2007: &amp;amp;quot;Data Streaming&amp;amp;quot;</title><content type="html">I'm glad you enjoyed the talk.

In particular, there's technical information available as a Word .docx, and you can download beta1 if you want to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of playing...  I mentioned in an earlier post that you can build your own cluster with very little hardware, e.g. I'm using 2 dual-core Mac Minis.  Phil Pennington just &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/philpenn/archive/2007/11/15/virtual-hpc-cluster-on-a-notebook-pc.aspx"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; how to setup a cluster on your laptop / desktop using virtualization, very cool.  Just add lots of RAM, and hopefully you have a few cores free on your CPU :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>joe-hummel</name></author></entry><entry><id>50285</id><published>2008-02-20T21:06:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-02-20T21:06:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">incorrect MSMPE 64-bit library installed as part of SDK for Compute Cluster Pack</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;During the first run of our Windows Compute Cluster Server class last week in Irvine, we discovered that when you install the SDK for Compute Cluster Pack, the wrong version of msmpe.lib is installed.  In particular, the 64-bit msmpe.lib file, which gets installed into C:\Program Files\Microsoft Compute Cluster Pack\Lib\amd64, is actually the 32-bit library.  So when you compile in 64-bit mode and link against the 64-bit msmpe.lib, you get unresolved symbols for the MPI functions:  MPI_Init, MPI_Send, MPI_Recv, MPI_Finalize, etc.  Microsoft has built a correct version of the library, which I've made available &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/drjoe/wccs/msmpe-amd64.zip"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some background...  The SDK for Compute Cluster Pack is the MPI programming libraries for Windows Compute Cluster Server.  There are 2 libraries each for 32-bit and 64-bit.  For normal MPI programming, you link against msmpi.lib.  For MPI programming with &lt;a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/www/www4/MPE.html"&gt;MPE-based&lt;/a&gt; event tracing, you link against msmpe.lib.  The 32-bit msmpe.lib file is fine, the 64-bit msmpe.lib file is incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>joe-hummel</name></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>50894</id><published>2008-05-11T16:04:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2008-05-11T16:04:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment"></category><title type="text">re: incorrect MSMPE 64-bit library installed as part of SDK for Compute Cluster Pack</title><content type="html">Thanks for the post Joe.

You are correcxt, support for MPE is currently not available in HPC Server 2008, and it appears it has been dropped from the product --- it is being replaced by Event Tracing for Windows(ETW), which is a better technology in the long run given it's deep integration with windows (and not just MPI).  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But in the short run, the problem with ETW is that there's no GUI visualizer for the trace, i.e. no equivalent to Jumpshot for visualizing the trace info.  Tools are coming, but as of today, nothing is available.  Right now, you can capture an ETW trace via "mpiexec -tf tracefile ...", then covert that trace to OTF (open trace format).  But then there's no way to view the OTF file, at least not on Windows (all the tools are UNIX-based).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So if you want to do tracing today, what I recommend is that you download the updated 64-bit MPE library, drop it into the same directory as msmpi.lib, link against it (instead of the msmpi.lib), and run the .exe on your cluster.  Then grab the .clog file, download back to your dev machine, and use Jumpshot to convert to .slog and view.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In other words, MPE still works, it just doesn't ship with HPC Server 2008.

To work with OpenMP, nothing is required other than Visual Studio 2005 or 2008.  

To work with MPI, you need to install either "SDK for Compute Cluster Server Pack" or "SDK for HPC Server".  The tutorial assumes the SDK for HPC Server, the latest version of which can be downloaded from http://connect.microsoft.com --- you have to signup for the HPC Server beta program.  Alternatively, the SDK for CCS Pack is freely available on the internet, just search.  This will also you to build and run the MPI applications; you'll need to configure Visual Studio differently, but the differences are obvious (C:\Program Files\Compute Cluster Server\...).

To interact with a cluster as discussed in the tutorial, you should join the beta program for HPC Server, download HPC Server Pack, and install.

&lt;p&gt;We start with a GUI-based Mandelbrot application, and show various ways to parallelize the application via multi-threading --- explicitly with .NET threads, then implicitly with OpenMP and the TPL (Task Parallel Library in the upcoming PFx, or Parallel Extensions to .NET).  We then architect a client-server version of the Mandelbrot app, introduce Windows HPC Server 2008, and show how to parallelize the app across a cluster.  This includes a discussion of many topics, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-threading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-processing&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p style="PADDING-LEFT: 30px"&gt;mpiexec  -n  4  MyMPIApp.exe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dialog box immediately appeared with the error message "The procedure entry point GetProcessIdOfThread could not be located in the dynamic link library KERNEL32.dll".  I closed the dialog, and the console window then displayed this error message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Design considerations for parallel programming"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Improved Support for Parallelism in the next version of Visual Studio"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Solving 11 Likely Problems in your Multithreaded Code"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Build Concurrent Apps From Simple F# Expressions"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm currently reading #4, since I'm a believer that functional programming may be one of the ways we make parallel processing safer, scalable, and generally more approachable.  I don't see much in F# yet, it seems right now to be just another way to gain access to PFx and MPI.NET.  But the potential is definitely there.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that isn't enough, the latest &lt;a href="http://mags.acm.org/queue/200809/"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; (Oct 2008) of ACM's Queue magazine ("Architecting Tomorrow's Computing") presents a broader view of the concurrency problem, with articles on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Real-world Concurrency"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Erlang for Concurrent Programming"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Parallel Programming with Transactional Memory"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erlang is another functional language, but with a proven process-based approach to concurrency and parallel processing.  I'm just learning about Erlang now, I really really need to implement some apps and collect some performance numbers.  Erlang's process-oriented concurrency model was originally designed for system building and robustness, so the question is how it fares for HPC.  Transactional memory is an interesting approach --- in short, you don't worry about accessing shared memory, you just go for it and check when you're done to see if a conflict has occurred.  If not, you commit, otherwise you rollback and try again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Multi-threading for performance:  a move towards HPC"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"High-performance Computing with Windows HPC Server 2008"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks revolved around 2 demos, a GUI-based Mandelbrot application and a console-based Contrast Stretching (image processing) application.  We talked about explicit multi-threading with the .NET thread class, then using Microsoft's upcoming Task Parallel Library (TPL) due to ship in .NET 4.0 as part of the parallel extensions to the .NET framework (aka PFx).  Showed the sequential versions of these applications, the multi-threaded versions, then versions running under HPC Server 2008 via parametric sweep and MPI/MPI.NET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other mistake was not anticipating the nuances of a travelling cluster --- in particular the nuances of cluster networking.  Cluster nodes typically have at least 2 NICs:  one for the public ("enterprise") network, and one for the internal cluster ("private") network.  The private network is often a high-speed networking technology, e.g. InfiniBand.  When you install HPC Server 2008, one of the first things you do is select your networking topology for the cluster, designating which NIC to use for the enterprise network, which for the private network, disabling the firewall on the private network, etc.  As nodes come under control of HPC Server, their network settings are configured to match the selected topology.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first complication is that machines now have at least 2 IP addresses, so what does the hosts table look like?  Second, what if you have the cluster running in location X with enterprise addresses a.b.c.d, then unplug, fly to Austin for supercomputing, and plug into their local network and get new addresses e.f.g.h?  Or worse, what happens if you aren't given local IP addresses at all, so the enterprise network of the cluster appears disconnected?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this is why, the night before my presentation, I got the cluster out of the exhibit hall, wheeled it up to the 4th floor, went into my room, and got the cluster ready.  Plugged it in, booted the nodes, and ran my demos.  Worked like a champ!  Until the last demo, which failed because I forgot to turn the head node into a broker node (to enable WCF-based HPC apps).  I tried changing the headnode into a broker node, and got an error about the enterprise network not being found.  Humm, strange, but then again, I'm in a new location.  So I reconfigured the cluster's network configuration, telling HPC Server which NIC was the enterprise network and which was the private network.  The WCF-based demo worked, I was happy, and went back to the hotel, confident the cluster was ready (I even left it running all night so it would be ready to go in the morning).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm so confident all is well that I don't retest my demos (bad idea).  I also didn't regression test the demos, which I should have done after I made that change to the network configuration (bad idea).  So of course, what happens?  Start the presentation, things are going well, and the first demo --- the easiest one! --- tanks with a behavior I've never seen before.  The processes can't write to the public network share for the client to harvest the results, what's up with that?  And I had tested this just 12 hours earlier?!  Wow, every presenters nightmare.  (Luckily I had a backup cluster, which eventually I started using once someone in the audience reminded me I had a backup cluster :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the issue, and I beleive this is new in the final RTM of HPC Server 2008.  Turns out that HPC Server stores machine names and IP addresses in the hosts file:  C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts.  On my cluster, with 2 NICs, the file looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;# ManageFile = true&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;127.0.0.1              localhost&lt;br /&gt;10.20.30.1            HEADNODE                       #HPC&lt;br /&gt;10.20.30.2            COMPUTE1                      #HPC&lt;br /&gt;10.20.30.3            COMPUTE2                      #HPC&lt;br /&gt;10.20.30.4            COMPUTE3                      #HPC&lt;br /&gt;10.20.30.1            Enterprise.HEADNODE        #HPC&lt;br /&gt;10.20.30.2            Enterprise.COMPUTE1        #HPC&lt;br /&gt;10.20.30.3            Enterprise.COMPUTE2        #HPC&lt;br /&gt;10.20.30.4            Enterprise.COMPUTE3        #HPC&lt;br /&gt;192.168.1.128       Private.HEADNODE             #HPC&lt;br /&gt;192.168.1.129       Private.COMPUTE1             #HPC&lt;br /&gt;192.168.1.130       Private.COMPUTE2             #HPC&lt;br /&gt;192.168.1.131       Private.COMPUTE3             #HPC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "true" means HPC Server is managing this file.  So if you unplug the cluster and move it, when you boot in a new location the hosts file is wrong (on every node).  So anything involving the enterprise network fails (which many apps rely upon for data deployment and aggregation).  Likewise, if you move the cluster and reconfigure the enterprise network --- but the local DHCP doesn't give you IP addresses --- then HPC Server can't find a valid public network and again the hosts file is incorrect (since now there is no enterprise network).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the moral of the story?  If your apps are just hanging -- hang trying to write results to a network share, or hang waiting for results back from WCF-based services --- then check your networking.  Seems obvious now of course, but it's hard to know where to start.  I'd start with the hosts file, since this was *also* wrong on my backup cluster and solves a problem I've been having for 2 weeks.  In that case the hosts file was missing the Private.* entries (not sure why), which caused WCF to fail but everthing else (including MPI) worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Michael Wolfe, a very well-respected individual in the HPC community, has written what I think is an excellent, 3-page article putting OpenCL into perspective.  It's titled "Compilers and More:  OpenCL Promises and Potential", and is available &lt;a title="here" href="http://www.hpcwire.com/features/Compilers-and-More-OpenCL-Promises-and-Potential-58625442.html?viewAll=y"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  In short, Dr. Wolfe reminds us that MPI and OpenMP are long-standing approaches for a reason, and nicely relates OpenCL to MPI and OpenMP programming.  He also argues that while OpenCL is not simple nor performance portable, it may find a very successful niche as an intermediate language, or as a language for library writers.  "So let's accept and even celebrate OpenCL for what it is, and not try to make it what it can't be."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the HPC space, the architect of Microsoft's HPC SOA framework, Ming Xu, gave a very nice &lt;a title="talk" href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/P09-01"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; on the SOA approach to HPC.  In particular, he demoed the &lt;a title="SOA debugger" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2009/08/07/debugging-profiling-and-analyzing-parallel-applications.aspx"&gt;SOA cluster debugger&lt;/a&gt; coming soon from Microsoft.  This is going to grealy improve the SOA development experience.  You can set a breakpoint in your service code, and run your client --- VS deploys the service, attaches the debugger remotely to the services running on the cluster, and the breakpoint is hit back *on the client* in Visual Studio.  Very very cool.  I hear it will be available as a plug-in for VS 2008, and available in some form (plug-in or built-in) with VS 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along similar lines, if you are working with MPI, it is already possible to remotely debug MPI apps running on the cluster --- i.e., you can be in front of your development workstation and debug an MPI app running live on the cluster.  But it's a pain to setup.  Our friends at Microsoft (Robert Palmer et al.) have improved this story as well:  available now for VS 2008 (as a &lt;a title="plug-in" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2009/08/07/debugging-profiling-and-analyzing-parallel-applications.aspx"&gt;plug-in&lt;/a&gt;) and VS 2010 (built-in), there is support for automating the remote debugging of MPI apps running on the cluster.  A great step forward in MPI debugging.  In addition, Daniel Moth has a nice &lt;a title="blog entry" href="http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/2009/11/mpi-cluster-debugger-launch-integration.html"&gt;blog entry&lt;/a&gt; summarizing the MPI debugger in VS 2010, with a link to a channel 9 video.  Thanks guys!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>joe-hummel</name></author></entry><entry><id>73625</id><published>2009-11-18T18:23:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2009-11-18T18:23:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">MPI Cluster debugger plug-in for Visual Studio 2008 and 2010</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I noted in a previous blog entry, the MPI debugging story just took another great step forward in Visual Studio and HPC Server 2008.  In short, you can be in front of you dev workstation (and inside Visual Studio!) and debug an MPI app running live on the cluster.  If you are using Visual Studio 2008, there's now a &lt;a title="plug-in" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;amp;FamilyID=d3993532-bdf8-4024-b164-db2ee8a851f5"&gt;plug-in&lt;/a&gt; available to automate the setup of this scenario, and here's a &lt;a title="blog entry" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/hpctrekker/archive/2009/07/18/5-minute-tutorial-on-the-amazingly-easy-to-use-mpi-cluster-debugger.aspx"&gt;blog entry&lt;/a&gt; by Wenming Ye that provides a nice, 5-minute tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the technology front, last week Microsoft quietly released the next version ("V3") of their HPC Server product, officially called "HPC Server 2008 R2" (in case you didn't know, the naming convention refers to the underlying operating system on which the HPC Pack must be installed).  The next release adds a number of news features to the product, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improved support for HPC-based, service-oriented workloads, including fire-and-forget&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;integration with Excel 2010 for HPC-based spreadsheet execution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support for cycle-stealing from Windows 7 workstations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MPI and SOA debuggers (plugins for VS 2008, builtin to VS 2010)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved IT functionality (deployment, diagnostics, reporting, failover)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm also thoroughly enjoying the conference.  It's one of my favorites, and I consider it a must-do every year.  I thought I'd post some observations for those who were unable to make it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the big stories this year is GPU computing, with nVidia taking center stage.  The fastest computer in the world (based on the latest Top500 list) is a GPU-based computer, as well as #3 on that list.  Today's keynote by Bill Dally from nVidia and Stanford University overviewed the reasons for the GPU's success, in particular the power savings.  As we scale machines, one of the huge problems --- perhaps THE problem --- is power.  It was a compelling keynote, the kind that makes you want to run out the door and start GPU coding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the interesting things I learned about power consumption is that it takes more power to move data that it does to execute instructions.  And with HPC-style problems, we often have way more data than we do code.  So it's cheaper (in power) to place the data and move the code to it (the GPU model) rather than follow our time-honored von Neumann approach of storing the code and moving the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immediately following the keynote, I happen to hear a talk by Steve Wallach of Convey Computer (2008 Cray Award winner and SC 2000 keynote speaker).  He believes that the programmability of the supercomputer is the most important characteristic for success, and thought that the most interesting machine in the Top10 was not the #1 machine, but a French supercomputer at #6 that offered a familiar shared-memory programming model as well as 83% efficiency (peak vs. realized performance).  Contrast this with #1 GPU-based supercomputer, with only 54% efficiency and a MUCH more difficult programming model.  He also reminded the audience that we've seen "GPU programming" before:  the SIMD machines of the 80's and 90's, and we all know what happened to those.  This was a good talk to help moderate the GPU excitement; of course, the French machine probably needed a small nuclear reactor to power it :-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One other interesting tidbit: according to the monthly &lt;a title="TIOBE Programming Community Index" href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html"&gt;TIOBE Programming Community Index&lt;/a&gt;, as of Nov 2010 the most popular programming language is Java.  A close second is C --- yes, C.  That surprised me, and warmed my heart, as I love (and miss) C programming.  Then comes C++, PhP, and C#.  Based on this, and discussions at SC, I'd say the best HPC languages for all you kids to learn are:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C/C++/Fortran&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matlab/Mathematica&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CUDA/OpenCL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ohhhhh, if you are interested more in the business side of things, the opening keynote on disruptive technologies was absolutely fascinating.  It was given by Clayton Christensen of the Harvard Business School, and if the talk is available online, it's worth a watch.  He talked about the impact of disruptive technologies, and used case studies from the steel industry, food industry, automobile industry, and the electronics industry to make his points.  I'm no business guy, but this seemed like business gold to me.  And I now understand why Microsoft so aggressively defended the netbook market,  and why Microsoft also needs a strong play in the phone market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other changes include the notion of critial tasks (if a critical task fails, the job immediately fails), more dynamic use of workstation nodes whenever cycles are free, jobs that can submit other jobs (under the current job's credentials), and last but not least, a SOA cluster debugger plug-in for Visual Studio 2010.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, there is an update to the &lt;a title="HPC Pack 2008 R2 SDK with SP1" href="https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9bfa085b-7a0d-49bc-8d4a-cfc11c63fef9"&gt;HPC Pack 2008 R2 SDK with SP1&lt;/a&gt;.  I would expect similar updates to the client utils and MS-MPI redistributables, but as yet they haven't appeared for download.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>joe-hummel</name></author></entry><entry><id>98648</id><published>2011-03-09T06:19:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2011-03-09T06:19:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">&amp;quot;A Day of Multicore Programming on the .NET Platform&amp;quot;</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just got back from the MSFT office in San Francisco, where I had the pleasure of delivering my first day-long workshop on multicore programming using .NET.  It went pretty well, in fact here are a few &lt;a title="comments" href="http://www.sfsharp.org/events/16560940/"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; from attendees.  [ Thanks for the pointer Matt H.!]  The premise of the workshop is an introduction to multicore, single machine programming in .NET 4, covering&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;introduction to new task-oriented parallel programming model in .NET 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exploiting loop-level data parallelism, and task parallelism&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the pitfalls of parallel programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;patterns of parallel programming (task local storage, producer-consumer, speculative execution, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concurrent data structures&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;lots and lots of demos&lt;/li&gt;

(Luckily, it was cold but did not snow, or else I would have missed the workshop as I usually don't drive when it snows. I avoided the early morning traffic so I left home after 9, drove 40km and got there after 10am, but I wish I could get up earlier that morning and attend the whole workshop!!)

I know a lot of the background stuff, like OpenMP, PThreads, a bit of Win32 threading, a little Intel TBB, some MPI/PVM/UPC, a little hardware tricks like cache-to-cache transfer, transactional memory, etc, so *originally* I did not expect to learn any new concepts, except some Windows APIs (maybe?) as I mostly program on Unix/Linux...

I was wrong. I learned many .NET &amp;amp; Windows task library tricks and some concepts that I was supposed to know and I've always skipped, such as the basic loop interchange needed for optimizing matrix multiply. Quite often, I skip many of the solved problems (just call BLAS, GotoBLAS with TLB reach optimization, etc) as they're *already solved*. Further, most textbooks explain them in a long and borning way, always spending a lot of time on why it is slow.

Joe explained many of the basic concepts in a clear and interesting way, and his examples were simple and to the point. I really like Joe's way of  interactively doing the examples with the class -- i.e. time the original version, add or change a few lines, and then run the modified program and calculate the speedup. I think we need more workshops delivered by instructors like Joe, but in the mean time I will just look for Joe's webcasts!!

&lt;p&gt;As you probably know, in early May Microsoft went through a &lt;a title="reorganization" href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsofts-plan-to-increase-its-focus-on-developers-the-full-internal-memo/9327?tag=content;search-results-rivers"&gt;reorganization&lt;/a&gt;, and of interest to me was the fact that the Technical Computing group at Microsoft was dissolved, and the HPC team was moved under the Azure team.  So HPC was merging with Azure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to Mark's keynote, it dawned on me that we probably don't need a distinct HPC Server product anymore:  Azure contains a job scheduler, knows how to manage resources, and can allocate a set of nodes in the same rack of some datacenter to give you an on-demand cluster hosted entirely in the cloud.  And if Azure adds some InfiniBand support, GPUs, and fast local storage, this could be a very nice cluster indeed.  Need an on-premise cluster for security or data reasons?  Then you install Azure locally in the form of "Windows Azure Platform Appliance".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So take this with a huge grain of salt (as an academic, my business prediction confidence level is near 0 :-), but it seems logical that Windows HPC Server will disappear as we know it, and rolled into Azure.  The good news is that the *concepts* of HPC --- exposing parallelism, data locality, OpenMP, TPL, PPL, MPI, SOA, Excel, Dryad, parametric sweep, etc. etc. --- will live on, unchanged.  So no matter what happens in the end, continue to think in parallel, and all will be well :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>joe-hummel</name></author></entry><entry><id>99938</id><published>2011-06-03T15:34:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2011-06-03T15:34:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">summer workshop on multi-core programming</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The U. of Illinois is running a week-long &lt;a title="workshop" href="http://www.upcrc.illinois.edu/summer/2011/register.html"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt; on multicore programming this summer (July 25-29).  Unfortunately it's not free ($200-$500), but these folks are experts.  Read on for more details...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;################&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capacity is limited and is quickly filling up. Registration ends June 24th (or when capacity is reached). Register SOON to guarantee your participation!  Programmers with little or no exposure to parallelism have an opportunity to learn about multicore programming at the UPCRC Illinois Summer School to be held July 25-29, 2011 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week-long, intensive workshop will provide a solid foundation in the fundamentals of multicore programming, offer hands-on experience with the use of multicore languages and libraries, and introduce emerging research topics. Upon completion, participants will be equipped to choose the best multicore programming model for current and future projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prerequisites for the summer school include solid programming experience (C, C++, C# or Java languages) and a demonstrated interest in applying multicore programming to academic or professional pursuits.  On-site capacity for the summer school is limited to the first 60 participants to submit paid registration. Discounted rates for on-site participation are available for academic faculty, staff, and graduate students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about the summer school, visit the &lt;a title="website" href="http://www.upcrc.illinois.edu/summer/2011/index.html"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Registration is now open and will remain open until June 24, or until capacity is reached, whichever arrives first.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>joe-hummel</name></author></entry><entry><id>104203</id><published>2011-10-16T23:04:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2011-10-16T23:04:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">Speaking tuesday night (18 Oct 2011) at Chicago IT Architects Group meeting</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Are you in Chicago?  Looking for something to do this tuesday, October 18th?  I'm giving a talk on functional programming to the &lt;a title="Chicago IT Architects Group" href="http://chicagoarchitectsgroup.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Chicago IT Architects Group&lt;/a&gt;, run by Tim Murphy and Carl Franklin.  The talk is creatively entitled, "&lt;a title="Functional Programming --- Why?" href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9576282/__jh.net/Chicago-ITAG.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Functional Programming --- Why?&lt;/a&gt;" :-)  I hate to give it away now, but two reasons:  (1) easier to reason about program correctness, and (2) easier to parallelize.  Lots of &lt;a title="demos" href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9576282/__jh.net/Chicago-ITAG.zip" target="_blank"&gt;demos&lt;/a&gt; in F#.  Where?  TechNexus at 15th floor, 200 S Wacker, across from the Willis/Sears Tower.  Start time is 17:30.  Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>joe-hummel</name></author></entry><entry><id>104299</id><published>2011-10-23T21:45:00.0-05:00</published><updated>2011-10-23T21:45:00.0-05:00</updated><category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post"></category><title type="text">GPU meetup in Chicago this tuesday --- 25 Oct 2011</title><content type="html">&lt;p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"&gt;A meetup around GPUs is happening this tuesday (10/25) in Chicago...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Functional programming is still a niche, but a growing one certainly in the financial and scientific communities. A good read if you're looking for real-world motivation to try functional programming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved this one quote from the article, which made me trust the author even more:  "A complete commitment to immutability is a commitment to never building anything real."  I love the pure nature of functional programming, but certain aspects of machines are inherently stateful --- I/O in particular.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>joe-hummel</name></author></entry></feed>
